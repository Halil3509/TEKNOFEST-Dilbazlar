      "hi guys i’m 21 yrs old girl n for context my anxiety has made its self very prominent in my life recent (march till now) and it’s been getting unbearable to the point where i cannot sleep and recently feeling like i cannot be outside without feeling impending doom. i have a part time job and i take on the title of being a party girl but basically, recently i cannot be outside my house without getting anxious. i get burning brain sensations when im anxious and very stressed and i also move frantically, find myself doing my usual anxiety “tics” (not the correct word to use, i just cannot think of the word rn) and it all stops as soon as i park my car in my driveway, and a sensation of home safe is brought over me where it feels like i can conquer the world again (but i feel scared). im always looking over my shoulder and the Voices always tell me today will be the day i die (i also work at a high volume retail store that’s been frequently hit with theft at high measures) and i also just recently got diagnosed with ocd (my psychiatrist calls my type “harm” ocd) so im constantly constantly constantly checking for any factors that could kill me while im out of the home and sometimes even just go back inside if i feel like the Voices are too loud today. i have other things that i do. \n",
      "i also just want to get a general understanding of agoraphobia so if i am being annoying pls don’t be afraid to let me know but it’s actually becoming really scary. it’s been happening for months, today is just the day im noticing a pattern.\n",

      "Quick Update! Since my last post, I’ve began working 9 hours shifts 30 minutes away from home and hung out with friends 3 times! As I adjust to going out, i’ve noticed the worst part really is the drive to wherever Im going and the first 10 minutes there. I’ve been good at positive affirmations while driving so I don’t escalate to panic attacks, but I do still sit with a lot of panic. I’ve worked 2 shifts so far and i’m going into my 3rd in about 2 hours! I’m hoping the more I take this drive, the better i’ll feel about other drives. I’ve also noticed that when I drive to certain places overtime, I get more comfortable. So I think it is less of the distance and more of the familiarity and safety. By the end of my work days I usually feel 2/10 panic rather than the normal 4-6/10 because I’ve settled into the day more. Once you’re able to tackle going out you hit this wall of “how do i get rid of the panic in general even though i can manage it” but honestly I think that part goes away with time after you stop thinking about it. \n",

Just got off the phone with them and now they want me on risperidone and mirtazapine at the same time, both of which I’ve already tried!!!!. I am so beyond angry it’s hard to even think. I am sick of being giving these shit medications over and over again  which in my entire history of my life have never had a single good effect on me. I am so fucking alone and depressed, now even more so. I have no hope and just want to attempt again, nobody listens and they don’t care. The psychiatrist also gave me an occupational therapist who is not helping in the slightest, all shes given me is a breathing exercise which just makes me rage thinking about it. I can’t do this anymore I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Now I’m back at square one with the same old medications I’ve already tried. Why would they suddenly work now when not one has ever helped me. I can’t believe this is happening and I just wish this would all end. I can’t think of another way out at this point \n",

      "Hi there, title pretty much says it all. I recently got a major surgery which has made me more housebound than usual, but even before that I was struggling with feelings of never wanting to leave the house/never wanting to see anyone other than an extremely select few, etc. Just in general not seeing the appeal of things I usually would be excited to go out and do. I get extremely anxious at the thought of even picking up groceries or takeout and have been Instacarting and Doordashing more than I ought to. My question is, what is the best way to push back against agoraphobic tendencies? I am able to leave the house still (I have to at least once a week for work) but I am so so much happier when I can just be in the house all day. I feel like I could be inside for a whole month easily and be perfectly content as long as I still saw my loved ones. Does anyone have good exposure tips so I don't lapse into habits that will be hard to break? I also have been struggling with severe akathisia due to a bad reaction to a medication I am trying to get off of. I'm 25 btw.\n",

I have an anxiety medication that I will take that day. I hate the idea of being trapped, being surrounded by only strangers if I start having a panic attack, and I always think about what if I have a freak health concern that needs immediate attention and I’m stuck on the plane. I get so frustrated with myself for the last one because I am an averagely healthy 26 yo, never had a situation like that, I understand that it is irrational, and yet It’s still a major source of the anxiety.. \n",

      "I still deal with the fear of being trapped, but I feel it's much more reasonable now - normally I don't deal with it unless I AM truly trapped.

Big, over stimulating box stores are rough if I am far from the exit.  Otherwise, I am fine most places.\n",

I have proprioception and vestibular disorders that make it hard for me to move fast, keep up, stay steady.  I bump into things.  It's exhausting navigating that world.  At home, I move at my own pace, I keep my home quiet and not too brightly lit, tidy, calm.  I like to read, I like to rest.  I like my plants, my cats, I like just thinking,  I don't multitask well.  I don't own a cell phone.  I don't drive. I feel incredibly unsuited for the world.  A trip to the store leaves me drained and exhausted.  \n",

      "Hello everyone, last year I quit smoking marijuana because I started to feel off.. turned out, I got my first ever panic attack, happened about 3 days straight then constantly for 3 months. I had everything from anxiety, depression, DPDR, agoraphobia, intrusive thoughts, and OCD. I was completely confused on what was happening and was constantly afraid. I reached a point where I couldn’t go anywhere without my mom and couldn’t be home alone… I lost about 30lbs in that span and thought I was going absolutely nuts and had schizophrenia lol. Anyways, how I overcame it was essentially not giving a fuck. I took it slow, used exposure therapy and took little steps. I wasn’t going to live in fear anymore so I pushed my self everyday… after 7 months I forced myself back to work and to jujitsu. Although some days were trippy, I’m happy I overcame all of those adversities and it made me much stronger and thankful that I can help others out. If you have questions, feel free to ask! \n",

I wasn’t going to live in fear anymore so I pushed my self everyday… after 7 months I forced myself back to work and to jujitsu. Although some days were trippy, I’m happy I overcame all of those adversities and it made me much stronger and thankful that I can help others out. If you have questions, feel free to ask! \n",

      "So today I finally left the house for the first time in ages. Aside from moving twice (5-10 mins from my original location) I haven't left my house for any reason since 2018. I thought I'd be stuck like this forever and that I'd never leave, BUT I LEFT TODAY AND MADE MULTIPLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. Today was my partner and I's anniversary and he had yet to see me leave anywhere but I wanted to do something for our anniversary even if it was small. I woke up early and prepped with him and despite not quite understanding, he was so patient with me and encouraging. I ended up making my first Starbucks run with him, visited my sisters school, and drove around the neighborhood enjoying his fast car for about an hour and a half. Was mostly not anxious either. I had like 3 moments where I felt my chest sink but I was able to recover quickly. I probably wouldn't have done it without the help from you all. I've been applying methods you all have posted about as well as exposing myself. It was more scary just starting to do it than actually getting out there and being in it. I hope to have more successes in the future as I have been dying to leave. If you needed a sign to say fuck it and do it, this is it. You are so much stronger than you think. Kick your brain in the behind and get back out there. Even if it's just starting small. I used to be scared to shower or go outside or walk to the sidewalk but regardless of where you are you have to start somewhere and I promise no matter where you're at, you can do anything you put your mind to. Leave your room. Go take that shower. Go sit on your porch. Go chill in your car. Go for that walk. Go get yourself a sweet lil treat. YOU. CAN. DO. IT.\n",

Kick your brain in the behind and get back out there. Even if it's just starting small. I used to be scared to shower or go outside or walk to the sidewalk but regardless of where you are you have to start somewhere and I promise no matter where you're at, you can do anything you put your mind to. Leave your room. Go take that shower. Go sit on your porch. Go chill in your car. Go for that walk. Go get yourself a sweet lil treat. YOU. CAN. DO. IT.\n",

      "So today I finally left the house for the first time in ages. Aside from moving twice (5-10 mins from my original location) I haven't left my house for any reason since 2018. I thought I'd be stuck like this forever and that I'd never leave, BUT I LEFT TODAY AND MADE MULTIPLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. Today was my partner and I's anniversary and he had yet to see me leave anywhere but I wanted to do something for our anniversary even if it was small. I woke up early and prepped with him and despite not quite understanding, he was so patient with me and encouraging. I ended up making my first Starbucks run with him, visited my sisters school, and drove around the neighborhood enjoying his fast car for about an hour and a half. Was mostly not anxious either. I had like 3 moments where I felt my chest sink but I was able to recover quickly. I probably wouldn't have done it without the help from you all.

I want to feel normal again and not be anxious going out in public. I want to go to restaurants, malls, grocery stores, I want to live. Also with this internship slowly creeping closer, I just want to it more. How to I live in the moment? I want to be at my best shape for september, does anyone have any advice? \n",

      "Last year i was able to go places even an hour away with a train or whatever without having to use a safe person or even have a panic attack. Even with a giant fear of heights and dizziness i was able to go on a few hikes for an hour. Right now i can barely go outside even for 30 minutes. Im too scared to even play basketball with friends 10 min away. Feel powerless again with the derealiztion\n",

      "currently unemployed. been unemployed for 8 months and lost my job. during my job i sort of got some of my confidence back again after covid completely swept away all of my confidence and interacting skills. i used to be an extrovert until covid hit and i basically never left my house and stopped talking to practically all of my friends. however last year i got my first ever job that i held for a year. it took time but throughout working i gained confidence in myself, not fully but better than normal. was able to interact again. lost my job and now my social anxiety is worse than ever, so bad i don’t even go to events and my boyfriend will go without me. he wants me to meet his very good work friends one of them about to set him up with a life changing job, but i can’t. i am too afraid to go due to my agoraphobia. i avoid almost all situations that will make me feel uncomfortable because i have 0 confidence in myself. not even look wise, just feel like i will embarass myself by being too awkward. i also have nothing at all going for me because this has taken a toll in my life. they are rich insurance agents and i feel like i have nothing to even show for and am an embarassment of a girlfriend. i hate this. my boyfriend of 4 years is saying if things dont change within a couple of years he’s going to have to call it quits. which i understand, but i don’t know how or if i will ever get out of this. i am scared to even get help. i am worried about being judged by a mental health professional. i hate this. i hate this life.\n",

      "Last year I had an extreme mental breakdown from constantly being indoors all day everyday and somehow got myself a retail job. I took Ativan the night before the interview and the day of the interview and the orientation, I did great and ended up getting hired. The first few weeks were absolute hell, and around the same time my psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft for the first time. I ended up connecting with several of my coworkers and I started spending time with them outside of work, and then before I knew it, they randomly closed down the store I was working at and I also lost my prescription due to my insurance being cut. I was working there for about 9 months, now I’m back to how I was exactly nearly a year ago, it feels like I never worked there and it feels like ALL the progress I made is gone. I’m starting to feel really bad again, afraid to go out, I keep canceling plans with friends, I’ve tried applying to more jobs but the area I’m in is overpopulated and haven’t gotten any calls back from other jobs that are close by to me. I still try to go out but when I do, I still feel panicky. While I was working and on my meds I felt anxious at appropriate times but at the same time I felt almost carefree if that makes any sense. I’m scared I’ll never find another job again and start spiraling and feel horrible again. I wouldn’t wish agoraphobia or anxiety on anyone \n",

      "(have had severe agoraphobia for the past year and a half, working on exposure therapy for the past 8 months) so about a month ago i finally worked up the courage to get into the doctors... and was diagnosed with cancer. thankfully, I found an oncologist/cancer treatment center that's literally 8 minutes away from my house that was in my health insurance, i was soooo relieved. however getting the referal to go there was a hassel with my insurance– whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had my appointment with my primary care doctor just today to get that referral and i'd never seen him or been to that office before. it was a biiig building with multiple floors and i freaking hate riding in elevators or even just going up stories in a building because it's \"harder\" to get out. anyways i took my xanax an hour before my appointment and my mom drove us there (about 10 minutes away from my house). I get there to find out the office is on the second floor.... so before i can even think about it, i just get into the elevator. i'm already dizzy. i stop at the reception desk to check in and get some hand sanitizer on my hands to smell (helps ground me), and continued down the longest hall way to go wait infront of my doctors office. get called in and my heart feels like it's going a mile a minute. i'm trying to focus on slow and deep breaths while also trying to keep my mind fixated on one of my favorite memories from this past year– walking my dog on the beach during one of the most beautiful sunsets. meanwhile, she's taking my blood pressure and taking my pulse and I just feel it uncontrollably climbing. 167bpm. i told her i needed to step out and i'd be right back. i normally don't respond to anxious thoughts but this was about physically grounding to get my heart rate down because getting my refferal for the oncologist was a priority. so I went and looked out of this big window they had in the waiting room for a bit, just acknowledging the landscape and what kind of flowers they had on the sidewalk beneath us. i felt tears welling up in me so I asked my mom to come to the bathroom with me and cried for a few minutes. crying really was what helped bring my heart rate down over anything else. once i was done crying i splashed my face with water, popped an ice cube in my mouth (i always leave the house with a ziplock bag of ice, it's been proven that ice can help stop a panic attack in the body/brain) and decided to go back into that room with no windows (it was the worst) to get my referral. once i was back in i started looking at all the things on the walls and picking up pamphlets to look at. and was calm enough to get through the rest of my appointment. no matter how much xanax i take, it's the crying that saves me.\n",

I noticed there were quite a lot of bees out which I have a really bad phobia of. I pushed through and we got to the beach. We weren’t there for more than an hour and a bee ended up caught and stuck in my hair. Luckily my friend helped me get this thing out or it would’ve stung me! I started having a panic attack and it made me absolutely terrified to go back to the beach now with all these bees! I guess it was a success but not the way I needed it to end up. \n",
