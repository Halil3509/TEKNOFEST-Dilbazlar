I got nexplanon in for birth control purposes in highschool, but it caused non stop (light ish) bleeding and some acne issues I had never experienced before. After waiting awhile to see if it went away (it never did) and switching OBGYN's, I got it out after a year and a half or two (honestly don't remember which one at this point). However, since I've gotten it out I've suffered from PMDD and my skin issues haven't cleared. I got on SSRI's which helped, but then the PMDD seemed to have been potentially triggered by me trying Myo Inositol. Any thoughts? Should I get the arm implant back in for now for the progesterone? \n",

      "I was just recently diagnosed with pmdd (like within the month) and I am so glad that I finally have a name to what I have been feeling. I have some questions tho as I‚Äôm starting to do research on this and learn more about it. What are peoples experiences with getting off birth control to become pregnant? For a while I thought birth control helped me and then soon found out that wasn‚Äôt enough and was still having bad pmdd symptoms, so my doctor prescribed me Prozac. I haven‚Äôt taken it (Prozac) yet since I won‚Äôt pms until next month. With this new diagnosis I‚Äôm just having a lot of anxiety about my future health and when I am ready to get pregnant having to go off birth control. I‚Äôm hoping the Prozac helps and this won‚Äôt have to be a worry for me anyways, but so many emotions are going through my head rn. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs some moms out there that can give me advice:)) I am 23 yrs old and have a serious bf that is very supportive. Although I am not ready to have a child I am worried about what my future will look like!! Any advice for a newly diagnosed pmdd girly would be so greatly appreciated.. thank youuu\n",

      "I was put on progestogen only birth control two years ago to stop heavy periods and control PMDD - it worked a treat and I loved it! Missed a pill back in April (one pill!) and it seems to have triggered a bit of a nightmare - periods every other week with bad PMDD in the off weeks in between. This lasted for 8 weeks before the doctor told me to get off the pill because it wasn't working any more. I stopped taking it a month ago and ever since I feel like I've been stuck in luteal even though I seem to have gone back to a normalish cycle. I had one period 3 weeks after stopping and was expecting the relief when it arrived only to have symptoms intensify and get hit with the worst depression and anxiety of my life. I've heard that hormones need time to rebalance after the pill but this just seems crazy, it's so extreme! I'm starting SSRI's tomorrow because it's getting scary. Has anyone else had similar?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the pill was working so well so I'm gutted I've had to come off and I'm scared to go back on after this whole situation. Not sure what my next steps are but I have been getting pain in what feels like my left ovary so hopefully getting a scan soon. I'd like a total hysterectomy at this point but because I'm 31 it's incredibly hard to get one\n",
