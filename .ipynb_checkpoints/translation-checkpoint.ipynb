But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.</td>\n",

I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)</td>\n",

I'll be honest none of us here have girlfriends and females hardly ever come to the house. \\nI've been noticing lately that he likes to announce to everyone that he's got multiple women and shows off pictures and talks for hours in the common areas of the house to said women for hours in what I believe is an effort to make us all think he is cool. The thing is, I have on multiple occasions overheard things like \" babe, I will get the target(or sometimes apple) gift card to you when I get off work \" and so the first time I tried to be a good roommate and tell him the obvious truth. That he is being gamed. His rebuttal has usually been being mad at me or calling me a hater when in fact i just try to tell him that no reasonable woman who is into is going to demand for you to pay her in apple/target gift cards. I told him that if he actually met up with them in person and went on a date that would be a totally understandable gesture but to pay women you haven't even met and never will while acting cool doing it is really driving me nuts\\n\\nShould this annoy me as much as it does? I don't have a current gf but the mother of my children is a 10 and I have no intention of showing her off or anything else. \\n\\nPerhaps its just the living with all walks of life former addicts that is the issue here but I'm not too sure. As I write this he has the phone on speaker talking to a woman he hasn't and never will meet like he's a boss and I couldn't make this shit up but\\nLiterally as I'm writing this he is reading off the back off a target gift card. \\n\\nAm I just an asshole or is this guy a Clown?

So I had no idea what to do to next, I have no interests (which is really bothering me bcuz Iâ€™m trying new things to get into but I havenâ€™t found my thing yet), BUT I applied for an IT course in college which I have no knowledge about and little to no interest in. What Iâ€™m asking is.. do I just go with the flow and figure it out or do I find out my type of thing now before itâ€™s too late?\\nBtw Iâ€™m so worried about starting my IT course because everyone else seems to know what their doing with IT bad I have absolutely no idea and I feel I wonâ€™t catch onto itðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ I feel doomed.   \n",

This has happened before so I thought it was normal. But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.   \n",

I have two grown cats, while I was in college they were with my parents and just last month I was able to move them into my apartment. My one cat, for some fucking reason, has been spending most of his time laying on my shitty side table in the living room. Its a little fold out table I got when I moved in and needed a make-shift desk. Its plastic, its cheap, yet he LOVES it. I'll be sitting on the couch, WHERE THERES ROOM FOR HIM and look at him like hes insane. Hes doing it now, I turned to him and was like \"WHY?\" And he just stared back at me like I personally insulted him. Ive picked him up off the table and each time he climbs back up there!! There are so many comfy places for him, MY APARTMENT IS CARPETED FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YET HE SLEEPS ON THE LITTLE SHITTY PLASTIC TABLE!! What the hell is WRONG with this little man!!!   \n",
       "3  It's almost 4am but I'm so shaken up by what just happened that I can't rest easy, so I'll go straight to the point.\\n\\nMy friend (20M) and I (20F) used to have a thing for each other. I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now.

But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.</td>\n",

I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)</td>\n",

So I had no idea what to do to next, I have no interests (which is really bothering me bcuz Iâ€™m trying new things to get into but I havenâ€™t found my thing yet), BUT I applied for an IT course in college which I have no knowledge about and little to no interest in. What Iâ€™m asking is.. do I just go with the flow and figure it out or do I find out my type of thing now before itâ€™s too late?\\nBtw Iâ€™m so worried about starting my IT course because everyone else seems to know what their doing with IT bad I have absolutely no idea and I feel I wonâ€™t catch onto itðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ I feel doomed.   \n",

This has happened before so I thought it was normal. But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.   \n",

I have two grown cats, while I was in college they were with my parents and just last month I was able to move them into my apartment. My one cat, for some fucking reason, has been spending most of his time laying on my shitty side table in the living room. Its a little fold out table I got when I moved in and needed a make-shift desk. Its plastic, its cheap, yet he LOVES it. I'll be sitting on the couch, WHERE THERES ROOM FOR HIM and look at him like hes insane. Hes doing it now, I turned to him and was like \"WHY?\" And he just stared back at me like I personally insulted him. Ive picked him up off the table and each time he climbs back up there!! There are so many comfy places for him, MY APARTMENT IS CARPETED FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YET HE SLEEPS ON THE LITTLE SHITTY PLASTIC TABLE!! What the hell is WRONG with this little man!!!   \n",
       "3  It's almost 4am but I'm so shaken up by what just happened that I can't rest easy, so I'll go straight to the point.\\n\\nMy friend (20M) and I (20F) used to have a thing for each other. I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)   \n",

I'll be honest none of us here have girlfriends and females hardly ever come to the house. \\nI've been noticing lately that he likes to announce to everyone that he's got multiple women and shows off pictures and talks for hours in the common areas of the house to said women for hours in what I believe is an effort to make us all think he is cool. The thing is, I have on multiple occasions overheard things like \" babe, I will get the target(or sometimes apple) gift card to you when I get off work \" and so the first time I tried to be a good roommate and tell him the obvious truth. That he is being gamed. His rebuttal has usually been being mad at me or calling me a hater when in fact i just try to tell him that no reasonable woman who is into is going to demand for you to pay her in apple/target gift cards. I told him that if he actually met up with them in person and went on a date that would be a totally understandable gesture but to pay women you haven't even met and never will while acting cool doing it is really driving me nuts\\n\\nShould this annoy me as much as it does? I don't have a current gf but the mother of my children is a 10 and I have no intention of showing her off or anything else. \\n\\nPerhaps its just the living with all walks of life former addicts that is the issue here but I'm not too sure. As I write this he has the phone on speaker talking to a woman he hasn't and never will meet like he's a boss and I couldn't make this shit up but\\nLiterally as I'm writing this he is reading off the back off a target gift card. \\n\\nAm I just an asshole or is this guy a Clown? What do you guys think ?   \n",

So I had no idea what to do to next, I have no interests (which is really bothering me bcuz Iâ€™m trying new things to get into but I havenâ€™t found my thing yet), BUT I applied for an IT course in college which I have no knowledge about and little to no interest in. What Iâ€™m asking is.. do I just go with the flow and figure it out or do I find out my type of thing now before itâ€™s too late?\\nBtw Iâ€™m so worried about starting my IT course because everyone else seems to know what their doing with IT bad I have absolutely no idea and I feel I wonâ€™t catch onto itðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ I feel doomed.   \n",

This has happened before so I thought it was normal. But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.   \n",

I have two grown cats, while I was in college they were with my parents and just last month I was able to move them into my apartment. My one cat, for some fucking reason, has been spending most of his time laying on my shitty side table in the living room. Its a little fold out table I got when I moved in and needed a make-shift desk. Its plastic, its cheap, yet he LOVES it. I'll be sitting on the couch, WHERE THERES ROOM FOR HIM and look at him like hes insane. Hes doing it now, I turned to him and was like \"WHY?\" And he just stared back at me like I personally insulted him. Ive picked him up off the table and each time he climbs back up there!! There are so many comfy places for him, MY APARTMENT IS CARPETED FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YET HE SLEEPS ON THE LITTLE SHITTY PLASTIC TABLE!! What the hell is WRONG with this little man!!!   \n",
      "3     It's almost 4am but I'm so shaken up by what just happened that I can't rest easy, so I'll go straight to the point.\\n\\nMy friend (20M) and I (20F) used to have a thing for each other. I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)   \n",

I'll be honest none of us here have girlfriends and females hardly ever come to the house. \\nI've been noticing lately that he likes to announce to everyone that he's got multiple women and shows off pictures and talks for hours in the common areas of the house to said women for hours in what I believe is an effort to make us all think he is cool. The thing is, I have on multiple occasions overheard things like \" babe, I will get the target(or sometimes apple) gift card to you when I get off work \" and so the first time I tried to be a good roommate and tell him the obvious truth. That he is being gamed. His rebuttal has usually been being mad at me or calling me a hater when in fact i just try to tell him that no reasonable woman who is into is going to demand for you to pay her in apple/target gift cards. I told him that if he actually met up with them in person and went on a date that would be a totally understandable gesture but to pay women you haven't even met and never will while acting cool doing it is really driving me nuts\\n\\nShould this annoy me as much as it does? I don't have a current gf but the mother of my children is a 10 and I have no intention of showing her off or anything else. \\n\\nPerhaps its just the living with all walks of life former addicts that is the issue here but I'm not too sure. As I write this he has the phone on speaker talking to a woman he hasn't and never will meet like he's a boss and I couldn't make this shit up but\\nLiterally as I'm writing this he is reading off the back off a target gift card. \\n\\nAm I just an asshole or is this guy a Clown?

Justine cannot afford a lawyer.

I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a \" normal\" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any \" life skills\" and his answer was \"  not really\".  What are people's thoughts on this?   --- tl/dr...i'm creeped out by a man dating a woman 20 years younger even my last relationship was with a man 22 years older.   \n",

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment. We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder â€“ you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)</td>\n",

So I had no idea what to do to next, I have no interests (which is really bothering me bcuz Iâ€™m trying new things to get into but I havenâ€™t found my thing yet), BUT I applied for an IT course in college which I have no knowledge about and little to no interest in. What Iâ€™m asking is.. do I just go with the flow and figure it out or do I find out my type of thing now before itâ€™s too late?\\nBtw Iâ€™m so worried about starting my IT course because everyone else seems to know what their doing with IT bad I have absolutely no idea and I feel I wonâ€™t catch onto itðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ I feel doomed.   \n",

This has happened before so I thought it was normal. But on Saturday, he was too weak to stand up, and I knew something was wrong. I had to carry him to my car so we could go to the vet (which was hard because he's 70 lbs). I thought it might be a problem with his liver, I had no idea it was so serious. He's 13, but he still had so much energy.\\n\\nI get to the vet, they run some testing on him, and they told me the most heartbreaking news I could have heard. He has a large tumor on his spleen. It had ruptured and caused internal bleeding, and he was in critical condition. We would either have to do very risky surgery or put him down. My family decided because of his old age, it was best to put him down. \\n\\nIt's been the hardest couple of days without my buddy, and I feel so guilty that he probably had that tumor for months and I didn't know. I've been watching videos of him being the cute little guy he is to cheer myself up, but I miss him being with me. I've had him since I was 9 years old, and I'm 23 now. It's weird that when I wake up, he's not scratching at the door for me to let him outside. Yesterday I found a piece of his fur in my car and I just started sobbing. I love him so much. Rest in peace to my little buddy (who was not so little), Nugget.\\n\\ntl;dr: my dog had a tumor in his spleen, and we had to put him down. I miss him very much.   \n",

I have two grown cats, while I was in college they were with my parents and just last month I was able to move them into my apartment. My one cat, for some fucking reason, has been spending most of his time laying on my shitty side table in the living room. Its a little fold out table I got when I moved in and needed a make-shift desk. Its plastic, its cheap, yet he LOVES it. I'll be sitting on the couch, WHERE THERES ROOM FOR HIM and look at him like hes insane. Hes doing it now, I turned to him and was like \"WHY?\" And he just stared back at me like I personally insulted him. Ive picked him up off the table and each time he climbs back up there!! There are so many comfy places for him, MY APARTMENT IS CARPETED FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YET HE SLEEPS ON THE LITTLE SHITTY PLASTIC TABLE!! What the hell is WRONG with this little man!!!   \n",
       "3     It's almost 4am but I'm so shaken up by what just happened that I can't rest easy, so I'll go straight to the point.\\n\\nMy friend (20M) and I (20F) used to have a thing for each other. I know he had a crush on me at some point, which was unrequited because we barely knew each other at the time. He then fell out of love but we became very close. Good friendship and making-out from time to time. Then, I was the one who fell for him, but it was automatically unrequited because he was in love with someone else, so I didn't even try.\\n\\nLong story short, he's now dating the person but, tonight, he asked me how I'd feel if we were to have something between us again. \\n\\nAt first, I was \"cool\" with it, just worried that it was an impulsive choice and that he'd regret leaving his current partner just because he finds me pretty, which is something I told him. I told him that it wasn't worth it to leave his partner just to make out (and maybe even more as he suggested) with me one more time. But he wasn't actually planning on leaving them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's a part of the convo :\\n\\nMe: You're in a relationship and all so it's a bit awkward i guess ?\\n\\nHim: Which is why I said I'd be willing to try at least once (the making out or more) but yeah. Sorry if this made you uncomfortable actually, should've thought about that earlier.\\n\\nMe: It didn't make me uncomfortable. Stressed out, but not uncomfortable \\[...\\]. But how would you do that (the making out) if you're in a relationship with them ?\\n\\nHim: Like how in technical terms ? Well, it would be tricky, because we'd have to find a place where no-one can see us.\\n\\nMe: Don't tell me you were ready to cheat on them.\\n\\nHim: I didn't say that, Nastya.\\n\\nMe: Well, how am I supposed to understand it ? As much as I'm attracted to you, I'd never do that to your partner.\\n\\nHim: I don't know how it originally played out in my mind, but I do know that, for some reason, it wasn't considered as cheating because it would have happened only once and it would have been to make things clear. But it's a bit silly maybe\\n\\nMe: Still cheating, hell no.\\n\\nHim: Definitely actually. \\n\\nMe: That's fucking cheating. What's going on ? Like, what made you think that way ? Please, reflect on this.\\n\\nHim: I actually have no idea. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. \\n\\nMe: You love them and I'm just some chick you find attractive, it's not worth it. \\n\\nHim: I don't know what came over me. Probably just night thoughts, right ? Yep, just that and nothing else. I'm so sorry. God, why did I say all that. Why am I like this.\\n\\nMe: Dunno, cheating on your partner are weird night thoughts. Listen, I think you're just lost. You need to think and to calm down, too.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo make it short, I then told him to go to sleep and that he should take a break from both his partner and me for a few days. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I realise how much it sounds like the problem of a high-schooler. It's so silly, and yet, it shook me pretty badly. I already feel a little better, though.\\n\\nAlso, it's not *really* the first time it happened ? At some point, this time IRL, he was flirting with me pretty hard. When I decided we should talk about it, thinking I romantically had a chance with him after all, he told me he was just testing himself to see if he was still attracted to me, and said that he wasn't (*well that aged poorly*).\\n\\nHe genuinely seems remorseful, which is why I told him to take a break from the both of us. We also talked about the possibility of him being poly, but he's pretty sure that he isn't. He's in love with his partner and he's attracted to them, but he's also physically attracted to me. I just hope he'll take the time to gather his thoughts. He's a great guy, but he fucked up big time.\\n\\nWoah, I really feel much better, now. Good luck to the souls who will read this, if anyone will (I wouldn't). Honestly, when I started writing this, I was hurt, but now, I'm fine. If anything, this whole situation will probably help me to fully move on. \\n\\n(also, english isn't my first langage, so i'm sorry if it was jarring to read lol)   \n",

I'll be honest none of us here have girlfriends and females hardly ever come to the house. \\nI've been noticing lately that he likes to announce to everyone that he's got multiple women and shows off pictures and talks for hours in the common areas of the house to said women for hours in what I believe is an effort to make us all think he is cool. The thing is, I have on multiple occasions overheard things like \" babe, I will get the target(or sometimes apple) gift card to you when I get off work \" and so the first time I tried to be a good roommate and tell him the obvious truth. That he is being gamed. His rebuttal has usually been being mad at me or calling me a hater when in fact i just try to tell him that no reasonable woman who is into is going to demand for you to pay her in apple/target gift cards. I told him that if he actually met up with them in person and went on a date that would be a totally understandable gesture but to pay women you haven't even met and never will while acting cool doing it is really driving me nuts\\n\\nShould this annoy me as much as it does? I don't have a current gf but the mother of my children is a 10 and I have no intention of showing her off or anything else. \\n\\nPerhaps its just the living with all walks of life former addicts that is the issue here but I'm not too sure. As I write this he has the phone on speaker talking to a woman he hasn't and never will meet like he's a boss and I couldn't make this shit up but\\nLiterally as I'm writing this he is reading off the back off a target gift card. \\n\\nAm I just an asshole or is this guy a Clown?

Justine cannot afford a lawyer.

I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a \" normal\" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any \" life skills\" and his answer was \"  not really\".  What are people's thoughts on this?   --- tl/dr...i'm creeped out by a man dating a woman 20 years younger even my last relationship was with a man 22 years older.   \n",

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment. We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder â€“ you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

They have a good relationship.
