yes,"I have to mentally prepare myself and take the precautions I need... It’s inconsistent... a lot of the times I would genuinely go if it wasn’t for the agoraphobia... I’ve lost many opportunities, missed out on so much... wasn’t there a lot of the times my friends and family needed/wanted me... I struggle with anxiety... Sometimes even going to the market is too much."
yes,"I’ve been housebound over half my life... I don’t want to go back to being in bed, hyper sensitive and on edge constantly. I don’t even try to go out. It’s like subconsciously, I’ve accepted this is my life... I’m afraid to try. Incase I go back."
yes,"I haven’t driven a car for three years. I said fuck it, I’m not gonna let agoraphobia kill me. I hopped in the car and just freaking did it. All alone on highways, in traffic, through a toll."
yes,"I've been socially isolated since i was small, struggled socially, had a public breakdown, don't have a job or own income due to my severe lack in social skills and no car"

yes,I was diagnosed with agoraphobia at 16 but my mom didn’t care to help. She would emotionally abuse me and yell at me if I panicked. I now developed Obsessive compulsive disorder now revolving around worrying if I cheated on my partner.
yes,"My agoraphobia was great, i didn’t had any feeling of i have to leave. I did had some anxiety but thats normal ofc."

yes,I didn’t feel any anxiety or urge to run back home and hide in bed.

yes,"I had to take a long haul flight while I was struggling with agoraphobia, I was definitely anxious but thankfully it did not escalate."
yes,"I feel like a loser that they share beautiful places they see and adventures they have, when my biggest adventure is going to the store. I'm very happy for them, it's not me being jealous, it's more of a 'people without agoraphobia don't really understand it and in their eyes I'm probably just a boring person with boring life'."
no,It’s okay to cry! It’s not a setback. You DID it and should be so proud of yourself!
yes,"I tend to cry automatically when out of the house, especially when I'm feeling panic or overwhelmed."
yes,i just started crying cause of the sense of panic and overwhelmed feeling
yes,coming into a panic is overwhelming
yes,I pushed myself too far and I completely locked up and had to sit in front of a tree in some random person's yard crying.

yes,i cry often when i have to leave the house
no,All of the time
yes,"I struggle with depression too so I've been very down in the dumps anyway, and cannot find the right meds so I am on one that doesn't seem to help with that and routinely burst into tears lately. So the stress of trying to go anywhere often causes tears, but I'm in a car (that is my biggest trigger, every second in a car feels like an hour of intense torture)"
yes,There’s no point in exposure... when you just end up panicking and never really calming down.
yes,I do cry with exposure. Usually it comes after when I get home and I replay it all in my head but tears have happened many times. And at times during.

yes,when I’m in panic I can’t cry because I’m fighting for my life

no,Absolutely. It’s hard. But worth it.
yes,"when I'm out and about and having a panic struggle day, most of the time I am not able to cry because I'm tensed up and sort of rigidly focused on the panic attack. On those occasions when I can nudge the emotion a bit further and arrive at tears, I find it quite cleansing as the tensions are relieved instead of being bottled up inside."
yes,"I cry almost every time, nearly... and the crying still happens. I'm a sensitive person I guess and cry pretty easily... Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is really hard and takes some time but really worth it to keep at it."
no,Their moment of incomfort is worth it if it means you are on your way to freedom!!

yes,from barelly able to leave my house to being able to life like everybody else. back to point zero and up again.
yes,"Sometimes the way you view the world is a reflection of how you're feeling. Sort of how it can be a nice, sunny weather out, but your mind sees the world in monotone because of depression. I have a hard time making eye contact or looking at others. Somedays I can, most days I can't. Fight or flight mode sort of hijacks the part or your brain responsible for reason (at least for me). The hardest part for me comes when I see the same person and they remember me or find my anxiety annoying."
yes,Fight or flight mode sort of hijacks the part or your brain responsible for reason. It does. Just this week I had to turn around and get my power bank cause my phones batterie was running low. It was absolutly unreasonable and the person who was with me and I talked it through. But I couldn't get past it.
no,> I am getting there and you as well. I hope you will   find your way as well. thank you
yes,"I have agoraphobia because of my social anxiety. I feel guilty. I feel like I'm totally wasting my life but there's nothing I can do about it. I basically rot in my room, have pain from laying around all day, binge eat, binge watch netflix, watch other people on social media having their best life and cry, cry, cry and cry."
yes,"I felt dizzy, anxious and hypervigilant. I'm getting worse. I'm feeling very desperate."
yes,"I'm so afraid of vehicles because I don't know who's watching me or how they're percieving me. It just feels like I'm being judged constantly. I'm constantly thinking about going on a walk, because It's healthy for me and it's completely necessary. However, I can't push myself to do it. I just can't, I don't know how."
yes,"Feeling dissociated, hyperventilating, sometimes cold sweats even. But the one that f*** me up the most is the high HR."
yes,"I have had an intense fear of having to be somewhere for a set amount of time, with no escape or embarrassment if I need to leave... The fear of not being able to escape had caused lack of attendance at school and although I’m now 31, I’ve never been able to hold down a job due to my fear no matter how much I want/need to."
yes,feels really dumb... feels good to make progress
no,"I made a post a few days ago about how my Agorophobia was developing over a few months then hit suddenly a few weeks ago, but I was getting a new job Monday that i’m determined to do. Well, my partner recently started working at Disney and asked if I wanted to go with him. He didn’t wanna push me but I said, let’s just do it. I was having physical symptoms  the drive there, the first ten mins, and the very start of the first ride. BUT THE REST WAS AMAZING! I still had a little anxiety the entire time but I just shut down any negative thoughts and had fun! It was extremely hot and we walked 7 miles (something i didn’t think i can ever do since my trigger event) but I DID IT! I still had anticipatory anxiety about the drive back to his house, and my drive from his house but they were both fine. I’m even sitting with some hard breathing right now because I have court tomorrow and still have to start the new job monday, but honestly i’m ready to just do it all so that the symptoms eventually leave me. The worst part is the build up and letting the negative thoughts in! A little “you’re okay” to yourself goes a long way! I’m looking forward to going to court tomorrow (even though i’m extremely anxious) because it’s just another opportunity to prove to myself that i can do things and sit through/push away  my anxiety. Keep pushing guys! We’re all capable:)"
yes,"I am an agoraphobic for 2 years, not being able to go more than 500m away my apartment."
yes,"I am feeling extremely hopeless at the minute. My entire live has been turned upside down, I have lost all of my hobbies and relationships. Trying feels pointless and I am so so tired."
no,I recovered from agoraphobia a few years ago and I was hoping self isolation would not cause me to relapse. But now that things are reopening I find myself scared that isolation is ending and I will have to go outside.
yes,At my lowest point I got panic attacks from even being in the same room as my best friend and I couldn't go out - even in the middle of the night - without feeling like I was going to faint any second.
no,Two months ago I was in PHP because I couldn’t even walk around my block or go into a store without having a panic attack.
yes,"I could spend an entire year, several times a day, trying to walk around the block and it NEVER, EVER gets easier. I have the same feeling of pure terror from the panic every single time and I never have that moment where it clicks into my mind that there's actually nothing to be afraid of. If anything, it feels like it gets worse/more intense the more I try. Medication never put a dent in my phobia/panic level either. I have the same unbearable reaction where my heart is literally pushing 200 every single time and it turns into a feedback loop where it terrifies me so much that it just makes the panic/anxiety even worse, which makes my heart rate go even higher."
yes,"I'm not going anywhere, I'm still stuck at home, and I'm still having panic. I tried taking a walk across the street from my house, and could feel panic coming on. ...I haven't been into a store since November, I haven't driven further than a few miles in months, and now, I can feel things getting worse again, and I just want it to stop. ...I feel like I'm in prison, and my hope is fading fast."
yes,I felt like shit and i was extremely bloated and gassy. This made me so anxious and i wanted to leave the building the whole time cause i just hate this feeling. This is the exact feeling that i was always pushing away and that made me agoraphobic and caused me pushing people away.
yes,I tried yesterday but got too overwhelmed so i’m going to try again today!! ... I wasn’t feeling too anxious at all! It was more so excitement to make progress.
yes,I have severe social phobia and probably what is considered mild agorophobia. I have developed this warped avoidant personality and often feel agitated when people talk to me. I've cried at interviews because of the stress and anxiety and then I freeze up and forget what to say.
yes,I have completely stopped driving or going anywhere without my 'safe person'.
yes,I barely even check my mail or buy groceries. I really regret making that promise and really don't want to go.
yes,"I have a panic disorder. Ive been agoraphobic on and off for decades. I cant drive without my body freaking out while my mind is so upset with myself. Its like I dont get to decide how I feel and im just stuck in this body that won't cooperate with me. I cant stop this endless panicking worry that I won't be able to enjoy anything because once I try and go or once I get there I will be out of my mind with shaking legs, sweating, nausea, bathroom issues, heart racing, fainting, the need to escape NOW. Its so maddening. I cant. I dont want to accept it and everyday my condition is controlling everything I do. How can I work if I cant drive there or stay there? Noone can count on me. Im always living in the shadows and I miss the sunshine. I miss people."
yes,"I was terrified, I didn’t think I could do it. and might have freaked out twice"
yes,"started with stomach problems, then it turned into fear of having stomach issues in public, then I started to control food and starve myself if I had to leave the house, and the more I avoided the stronger it all got"
yes,I could barely leave my bed just months ago.
yes,"I get diarrhea and panic attacks/hot when I leave the house for most things sometimes pepto bismol helps, sometimes it doesn’t. I have a really hard time in lines and in busy places…. I’m scared."
yes,"I started feeling anxious and panicky...I kept thinking about passing out and my 13 year old daughter having to be so scared...I feel anxious even as I’m waiting for the cross walk to turn green at times. I overthink any driving I need to do and check the traffic a bunch. Any little sign of traffic or an intersection that I may get “stuck” at and I’m anxious, sometimes I just do go...I feel like a failure for letting myself get this bad again...I didn’t go today cause I saw there was traffic so I just worked from home."
yes,"felt really anxious and thought I'd have to leave but, thanks to some great advice, I sat with my feelings and ended up getting the job."
yes,"I took some Imodium because I’m the shit-yourself kind of agoraphobic... I got ready early and stewed in it for a long time, debated buying depends, thought about how this anxiety is unbearable... By the time we got into the 6x10ish hallway just before the waiting room, I was at one point surrounded by fourteen people. I couldn’t make “chicken wings,” with my arms without bumping into people. To say I felt trapped is a fucking *understatement.* My heart rate was double what it usually is... I’m five weeks on Lexapro, but my panic routine felt the same."
yes,"Stepping out of home can be for any insignificant reason like buying grocery, or running errands, or simply going to nearby shop."
yes,I lack consistency. I always feel like I need a “reason” to go out and I usually use that as the motivation (or maybe it’s an excuse).
yes,i was so worried about being alone but i actually quite enjoyed it???? i actually loved the alone time with my dog and was relaxed.
yes,I cannot sleep... I am scared of taking public transportation
yes,can't leave the house without a panic attack
no,It wasn't so bad.
no,"i’m serious when i say this, anyone can recover from agoraphobia. i don’t care if you haven’t left your house in 20 years. YOU. ARENT. A. LOST. CAUSE. the only way things will never get better is if you give up on trying. it will be difficult and it could take a long time, but the end result will always be worth it. i just don’t want any of you to give up, i don’t want you to compare yourselves to others, you can get through this. also please remember, you’ve made it this far. so give yourself a pat on the back for that!!"
yes,I feel left out and I HATE IT. so sad.
yes,"The thought of dealing with the general public is overwhelming. Everytime I feel like I can do it, I get overwhelmed with other stresses like severe depression."
yes,"I try to avoid going anywhere besides work because it’s just mentally too much, but I can’t live my life inside?"
yes,I’ve suffered from anxiety and panic attacks my whole life and now it’s extreme agoraphobia I face on a daily basis which makes me very secluded to the things I can do and places I go.
yes,I couldn't stand for long because the anxiety started to kick in and I felt scared
yes,I feel like if I could just go back to living even if it was with restrictions it would be better than living within these four walls.
yes,I've had severe-ish agoraphobia for a year. I've become almost completely housebound in the span of a week. I used to be able to go for small walks around my house anxiety-free but now the same walks give me extreme anxiety and I start to get panic attack symptoms.
yes,"Three years ago, I couldn’t even step out of the house to take the trash out just 20 meters away. Yesterday, I took a 12-hour bus ride and moved into our family’s summer house to live alone for three months."
yes,"I'm petrified of heat- mostly the reason I'm agoraphobic. I started have a bit of panic, face went numb and I was shaking... I started to have a full on panic attack and I was hyperventilating and crying"
yes,"agoraphobia makes you feel like less of an adult. I almost feel eternally frozen at the age at which the disorder began...I find myself reminiscing about fun memories with friends years ago...I feel like a child in other ways too, like being unable to go to certain places or needing people to be gentle and accommodating to my needs. It’s a really strange feeling. Sometimes it makes me sad, other times it makes me mad/frustrated."
yes,"I just snapped and couldn't even leave my room and constantly have panic attacks and feelings nauseous even when it was just me in my room let alone when I tried to leave my room... I'm now able to walk around my house with family here and go in the garden but that's it and I just got to the point where I'm constantly having suicidal thoughts, feeling alone and constantly anxious when ever I know people is coming to the house"
yes,the thought of being stuck in traffic and not being able to get out scares me so much
yes,I was walking and suddenly felt a bit dizzy which immediately triggered a panic attack. My heart was beating so fast and I thought im gonna black out and I wanted to run outside immediately
yes,Our 15 year has agoraphobia and it's been getting worse even though she's in therapy and we're trying to find the right combo of meds.
yes,"I have suicidal thoughts (I don't intend to ever act on these), but i know it's only because my brain wants a break. It wants to shut off. It's a fight every day to face these fears and I am so tired."
yes,It was very hard. It must be hard for you too. Your daughter may in time feel that need to want to push herself to get further. It took me a while. I've been room bound to going anywhere but relapsed.
no,Glad I could help :)
no,I’m glad you liked it :)
yes,"I would fall into depression for awhile and start to feel like there’s no way out and nothing is ever gonna get better, but that’s all just in my head. The reality is that the feelings do pass just like everything else. Depression will tell me that I no longer like these things or that they’re not going to be fun or enjoyable, but I can prove it wrong by doing them anyway."
yes,"I mix alcohol in brand new soda bottles to keep my mind occupied just enough to get through a shift. I can't afford to miss more time. If I try not to drink, my mind begins to panic about trying not to have a panic attack in public."
yes,"I've been having agoraphobia for 7 years now. I felt like I was being judged and stared at, I know it was all my head but I think i felt like that because i was bullied all throughout my school years. Since that night my life had changed, I started isolating myself more and more. I get a lot of anxiety, sometimes I can't even eat, sleep and I have cry spells. I feel alone and not understood by anyone even my parents they think that this is a minor problem in my life and I need to get over. Every part of my body hurts everyday especially my neck, I know is because I'm anxious but I can't do anything about it. I tried meditation, breathing exercises, I tried to cut off lactose to my diet. I also get anxious inside my house, sometimes I wake up even at night for my anxiety or sometimes I can't sleep because of my anxiety. I fall asleep only because I'm exhausted for my anxiety. A year ago I decided to be brave and going to the dentist to get braces, going to appointments every month was tough but I did it anyway. Recently everything got worse every time I have to go I keep crying a week prior and I can't function properly. It doesn't happen only when going to the dentist but everywhere I go. It got worse to the point I can't go out on the bench of my condominium without being so anxious."
yes,"I'm basically afraid to move anywhere outside of my house, which is quite small. And dont like doing stuff in my yard because my neighbors can see me."
yes,"I get very anxious in crowds when I feel it would make a big scene to escape. I become very anxious. I get very hot, my heart beats so fast and I feel like I need to get out. I feel like I need to escape but I know leaving would cause a scene and make everyone look at me."
yes,my agoraphobia has gotten really bad recently
yes,"I’ve struggled with agoraphobia for around 3 years now, and for the past 5 months I’ve been totally housebound, I hadn’t so much as been in my garden or opened a window. My anxiety is bad, to the point I can’t even open the door and I hide in my room if a stranger is in the house."
yes,"I've been house bound for almost 3 months since my health anxiety and agoraphobia kicked in, and although this quick trip to get a donut was incredibly hard and scary for me, it feels good to be able to say i did it."
yes,I have severe panic attacks in cars due to agoraphobia
yes,I can't stand it.
yes,dealing with agoraphobia
no,"Hey everyone, i haven’t posted here for awhile so I decided to check in. ..."
yes,"4 years ago i had a panic attack in a restaurant which led to constant chronic DPDR every day after that. i’ve been on so many different meds, therapists, chat help, and suicide hotline. nothing. has. helped. recently, i’ve developed agoraphobia due to my panic attacks. i’m scared someone is going to see me faint, throw up, all that. but, what im specifically afraid of is the outdoors and i don’t see many people talk about that. i’m afraid of seeing the sky, clouds, grass, trees, and just because i feel like the world isn’t real. seeing nature and interacting in it freaks me out. even stepping outside to take the garbage out is panic inducing."
yes,"I had a hard time making friends and would often isolate from groups and go non verbal only realizing later that was probably a trauma response. I don't desire to be in a relationship, I don't desire friends, and I definitely don't want kids because I'm not fit to be a parent. One of the things that often scares me is if I actually do heal relapsing again and having no saftey net."
yes,"I'm very nervous because my 'safe person' won't be around... I am very afraid and worried, but I want to try to spend the night in another place, I want to prove to myself that I am not hopeless."
yes,I had left my house less than 20 times since November of 2019 and in December of 2021 I decided enough was enough.
yes,"I've noticed that when I've had a bit of a drinky-poo then a lot of my panic/anxiety fucks off. I can actually sit in my yard, feel relaxed and not want to hide in the greenhouse everytime a bird chirps. Its quite nice. I feel so normal. This is literally how I want to be every day. Zero fear or anxiety over stupid insignificant silly things."
yes,"I have bad anxiety and panic disorder, which makes me hesitant to leave the house for extended periods of time or on my own."
yes,My Dr wants to put me on propranolol as well as my buspar & cymbalta
yes,"the thought of going out of the house puts a pit in my stomach, even just stepping out of the door; I feel small and exposed and highly anxious, lots of crying and anxiety symptoms; I have massive anxiety at the thought of going out; i leave the house only about 1 times a month for medical appointments; supermarkets make me just completely shut off and kind of dissociate whilst also getting bodily anxiety."
yes,I get extreme anxiety working in the office. I hide in a phone cubby hole all day because I get anxious around other people.
yes,I've had agoraphobia (mostly the housebound kind) for 10 years. I dropped out of High school because of anxiety. I've never had a job. I hate this. I just want to be normal.
yes,struggling this week with the loneliness and constant reminder that i haven’t left my home in 4 months
yes,I (22F) am practically home bound because of agoraphobia and emetophobia... I’ve been seeing this particular therapist since the middle of September... I’ve become highly codependent as my mental health has deteriorated...
yes,"I have been dealing with agoraphobia combined with emetephobia for about 12 years... I struggle tremendously to eat outside the home and to eat new things or things I didn't make myself. Routinely my mother in law invites me to events that often involve huge meals. I have explained over and over how hard it is for me, but she guilt trips me. I try my best to stay at the time and not run. I try to eat - only usually able to eat a few bites. It's extremely stressful on me."
yes,I've accepted the fact that I will probably not be a good father because of agoraphobia
yes,I managed to prevent having a panic attack by breathing but I completely forgot what I even went to the shop for...I don’t even see the point in trying to get out more. I just feel like the cons outweigh the pros these days
yes,"I can't do shit. I'm not currently going to school or work or even going outside at all because every single time I do, I start freaking out."
yes,I have been struggling a LOT to leave the house... But I can’t seem to bring myself to do it.
yes,"i feel horrific for it. i don’t know what to do. i feel like the worst parent in the world...i have no friends...i just feel like this is so unfair on my daughter, on my mum, and on me. i’m lost. i’m broken."
yes,I'm feeling frustrated because I got a lot better for a few months and now I've gotten worse again.
yes,"I developed agoraphobia. I was afraid of having a POTS attack in public. Passing out is a very vulnerable state to be in surrounded by strangers. I didn't leave my house. I isolated myself from my friends also fearing and being embarrassed of my condition in front of them. I started to go out in my garden. Then an hour. And my Mam supported my every 'outing' always right there with me. I became dependent on her, she became my safe place."
yes,"I stood in line for half an hour. Thankfully, I didn't get a panic attack. I was very self-conscious tho."
yes,"I was shaking while getting dressed to go on my walk and almost turned around while unlocking the door. My heart was racing the entire way to the store, but..."
no,"I'm doing it. I'm overcoming my agoraphobia. I have gone from being afraid of going on a walk to driving my car alone on the interstate. Through months of persistent exposure therapy, I am noticing a huge change in myself and my fear is dissipating. I have been able to do things I thought I couldn't do. "
yes,"I'm afraid of something happening and being too far from my car... If I panic I can’t leave/get to my car quickly. I am worried of having a panic attack far in the venue and then will freak out more once I realize how far from the car I am. Like it’s my “safe space” won’t be able to get back there in time etc. I also have a fear of passing out and worried I’ll feel disoriented, dizzy, hot, thirsty, and unwell, causing me to pass out or see/think of something that may make me pass out."
yes,"i’ve suffered with agoraphobia since i was very young, i couldn’t even step outside and walk around the block!"
yes,I can't leave my house or make phone calls. I feel kind of hopeless.
yes,"I loved so much going to the cinema, but now it’s probably one of the places that scares me the most. I get so frightened."
yes,"I'm 32 years old, I've spent my whole life being scared of everything. I can’t drive, I can’t hold down a job, nothing.."
yes,I cant ever go out without a water bottle and my glasses. everytime i get a panic attack i call the safe person and it calms me down.
yes,I'm back to being the weird friend that people will forget about. Everyone else gets freedom and I'm still stuck.
yes,i think a lot of people on this sub can relate to the pandemic enabling their agoraphobia.. my mental health took a pit fall and i've been isolating myself since then. today i'm leaving the city to go shopping which includes a long car drive (which is p triggering for me) and being away from home.
yes,it's so hard to celebrate small victories without serious backlash from my own brain like why aren't you normal
yes,"I couldn’t leave the house at all. I mean I still have a hard time going places, but it’s so much better now."
yes,"I got scared earlier and drove home and panicked, thought I’d never be able to go out again or go to the airport."
yes,"I changed my returning flight earlier hoping it would ease the anticapatory anxiety, but it didn’t. For two months, I cried every month thinking about the trip. ... I started having panic attacks and holding onto my mom, begging her to please rescue me from this. I started throwing up and experiencing incontinence (due to anxiety+GI issues)."
yes,i had the worst panic attack ive ever had in my life. i felt a burning sensation all over my body and this uncomfortable feeling to the point i couldn’t handle it and this intense panic coursed through me like i’ve never experienced before...i felt paralysed i was shaking uncontrollably...then when my mum came home i was still anxious i could barley look at her. then when she came into my room she told me i was dog sitting with her for a week. this triggered a massive panic attack and i don’t know why but i ended up throwing up from that panic attack too...now i cannot step foot in their car. i can’t go to therapy or even do it online...i had to drop out of school...i just feel so lost now. i’m so young and i dont know what’s happening to me. when someone comes into the house it gives me panic attacks like ive never experienced before and i can barley leave my room at all.
yes,I feel like there’s no fucking escape and I hate it
yes,"I can't speak to another human being. I want to be comforted, not reminded of what I've been trying to do for years and failing miserably at."
no,"Holy shit guys, I've really made an insane amount of progress in the last two days. ..."
yes,"I wish it would have been longer, but my kiddo was running around and it gets difficult to converse and chase her. But I did it!!!"
yes,"I can't enjoy simple things like going to the park or visiting a museum... It makes me feel very sad, and angry."
yes,I’ve developed an intense fear of getting lost in unfamiliar areas when I drive even if I’m going somewhere I know well.
yes,my anxiety around leaving the house ... trigger me way too much
yes,"I deal with rapid heart beat, hand tinglingness and hand stiffness when I'm in an anxiety inducing situation"
yes,"my anxiety has been significantly lower since the pandemic and lockdowns. I love having no routine, no plans and being able to just stay home and go at my own pace."
yes,"I got up around 6:45am, and by 9am I really started to feel panicked. I have been doing pretty well with panic lately, and haven't had a bad issue since March at this point. So today was the worst I felt in awhile."
yes,He's been spiraling into anxiety whenever I'm not sitting right next to him. He gets real anxious whenever I have to leave for any reason. He spirals and starts thinking he's going to die if I'm not there.
yes,"I made a vow for myself to fight Agoraphobia. I was never homebound, but I was limited to about 30% of my city, and haven't left to a different town in two years. I've yet to pass the bridge that divides our cities, but I'm getting there."
yes,I’m proud of myself and can’t wait to become more confident in myself and less agoraphobic
no,"I'm so close to the point of considering myself fully recovered.     I developed agoraphobia when I was 15, I spent most of the years between 16-25 completely housebound - couldn't even go into our yard alone. I'm about to turn 28 and today I had my first ever job interview. It's just a cleaning position at the local hospital, and I had help getting the interview (my Job Service Provider was working behind the scenes to liaise with the employer) but I went and I was so so anxious but I didn't panic and overall things went ok - even if I don't get the job it still a fucking massive thing for me to even be able to go.     I'm currently completing a course to get my Year 10 equivalent, and have enrolled in another course (Cert IV Community Services) to complete this year. I'm aiming to become a lived experience mental health peer support worker, and hopefully help people who have had similar mental health challenges. I wish I'd had someone like that - someone who truly understood - when I was in the trenches of agoraphobia and depression, and I want to be that person for others.     I'm so, so close to not having any restrictions on my life due to anxiety. It's awesome, and something I spent years thinking was impossible. I didn't think I could get better. I didn't think I had a chance at a normal life. And now I'm so fucking close, and so immensely proud of myself.     Y'all can imagine better than anyone else how hard it was to get here, how unfathomable it feels and how big of a deal it really is. I just wanted to post to share with people who understand, and maybe give someone some hope that recovery is possible."
yes,"I had an embarrassing public panic attack, and was fired a couple weeks ago. I have locked myself in my room since! I’m going a little mad. ... I have childhood trauma, cptsd, it goes on & on! Once I get in the groove of things im fine, but sometimes stress gets too much and my body shuts down! I’ve been sleeping all day, and just sitting on my phone! I miss feeling the sun & fresh air and being out in nature"
yes,"I remember my first panic attack like it was yesterday. 16 in the winter of 2013. ...My brain asked that first question that would dominate my life ever since....""what if?"" ...I thought it could have been an allergic reaction...or that it could have been laced! I thought I was going to lose my life. I rushed back to my friend's house to see his Mom, who was a nurse. My heart was scalding hot in my chest and I was so high it felt like every heartbeat was hammering my body. I begged her to take me to the hospital, something had to be in the weed. She laughed at me and kept mocking me. I truly believed I would never see my parents again. My vision started to go and I passed out. It was the only time I've ever passed out from a panic attack. I woke up and it was better, my body calmed down while I was asleep. ... Within a few months after that event, I went out to Chipotle with that friend of mine. ... My brain whispered the ""what if?"" question....""what if he put something in *those* tortillas? what if those are laced with something?"" Ugh, typing that out hurts!! ... From then on, that fear of losing control applied to everything. Before I knew it, I had a fear of fear, and then a fear of fear of fear. ... I was afraid to do many things because of the ""what if"" question. ... I lost so much weight, I became frail. Within a few months, I had lost everything - my friends abandoned me, my hobbies disappeared, and I was completely homebound besides school, for some reason."
yes,"I wanted him, not those things and felt he was enough for me. He says he still loves me but refuses to just be with me. So frustrating and heart breaking. Fearful I’ll never move on from this."
yes,Im a man w agorafobia
yes,I am agoraphobic
yes,I'm a man(26) with agoraphobia currently... all i can do is just love her everyday and work on recovery everyday.
yes,I missed my daughters graduation and I’ll never forgive myself for it.
no,39m married
yes,"I mostly heard agoraphobic women say it was hard to find a partner, but fast forward to now and the experience is pretty even where the agoraphobic person tries online dating and eventually connects with someone who is ok with their condition."
yes,her patience with my anxiety
no,Thank you so much for sharing. This gives me hope
yes,your agoraphobia
yes,your agoraphobia
yes,your agoraphobia
yes,your agoraphobia
yes,still feel the same way...still hopeful we will come together
yes,I feel like a burden with agoraphobia. I feel good enough to do exposure with her for example. But thats a personal thing cause i feel i let people down if i for example have to leave etc. So its also hard for me to see friends.
yes,"My first time at the hospital for a panic attack was when I was five. I just panic, hyperventilate, pass out, and continue on with trying to make the best of life. It doesn’t stop me from doing a whole lot, it just keeps me from being able to enjoy it."
yes,My last relationship ended because of my agoraphobia. I‘ve been dating for some time now but got rejected for the same reason again and again.
yes,For me it started in my early teens. So I’ve never been in the 'real' dating game.
yes,Dating for man is harder without agoraphobia too. I understand the struggle. But having a girlfriend when having agoraphobia can cause stress too.
yes,I let them know very early on what my mental health problems are. I find that I’m much less ashamed of them when I’m not trying to hide them.
no,"Thank you, appreciate it."
yes,"I couldn’t even look out the window or do light indoor exercise, as the breathing and heart rate reminded me of my panic attacks. ... Anxiety always wants something more. For me , it was sound sensitivity (loud running sinks, vacuum cleaners) and inability to eat many previously tolerated or even enjoyable foods."
yes,I've been feeling very lonely. I can't feel close to people. I'm really bad at eye contact and I don't really like talking face to face with anyone.
yes,"I’m being such a fucking loser, not able to leave my room? I’m doing so because I’m so scared and anxious and get panic attacks trying to leave"
yes,"He gets very anxious and has panic attacks whenever we leave the house whether it be for a walk, drive, etc. It has become so severe that he has difficulty just going to the corner store. He gets very dizzy, sweaty, and extremely nauseous. Once he has a panic attack somewhere, he cannot return to that place without having another full blown panic attack."
yes,"I always end up hitting a wall where it feels like my exposures stop working and I need to just stop altogether, let my progress go, then pick it up when I'm feeling better."
yes,I’ve been off meds for quite a long time but I’m still getting anticipatory anxiety. I have Xanax in case I have a terrible panic attack but I’m praying that I can manage it.
yes,"I feel a lot better than before and everyday I’m taking baby steps. I can do the basics within my own town, but the thought of going further or even an hour away petrifies me. Public transport etc still seems impossible."
yes,"i feel nervous to go out and do normal things on my own. including malls, movie theaters, eating out with friends, and driving."
no,"Been at the lowest point ever for about a year now. I can’t drive, when I do it’s no farther than a stoplight because I freak out being far from home. No way I could walk into any establishment. ... "
yes,cloudy days are so much better for my agoraphobia
yes,i almost panicked but i made it through. im kind of scared to drive back but im trying to calm myself down.
yes,If I can barely leave the house why am I obliged to see a doctor that is 30 mins away. My condition LITERALLY prevents me from being able to come to you. Like do I have to die from panic attacks just so that I can get treatment?
yes,"Once I stopped going outside, or even looking outside, my eyesight got A LOT worse. More years passed and it’s now still steadily getting worse, but less rapidly like before."
no,Yes!! It was absolutely the best single action I took to recover. lt is my top recommendation whenever anyone asks for help. I did it in 2021 and haven’t had a panic attack since doing it. There was only so much regular therapy could help with a phobia when I knew it was irrational. Hypnotherapy helped work with my subconscious to just calm it down. 10/10
no,For me didn't help.
no,It didn't help for me
no,"I think with the shortest possible answer with the longest explaination:   Yes, if you believe it will work, it will."
no,that's a very hypnosis based kinda response haha
yes,"I feel like I have an idea. I'd say that was the one moment that really changed things for me. And from there, things kind of built up over several months until I was too anxious to do anything. I know I *shouldn't* feel ashamed, but sometimes I feel shameful in the fact that I've got so much anxiety over something so small."
yes,"I’m terrified of being anywhere where I don’t have the power to leave the situation at any moment. I’m scared to work in a locked unit at the hospital, scared to be in a car that someone else is driving, etc. I can’t even go somewhere in a friend’s car unless I drive and keep their keys while we’re out because I’m so afraid of getting stranded."
yes,"I'm 36, and a shut-in. I rarely leave the house. [...] anxiety [...] the panic sensations will come flooding in, I'll feel faint, and maybe I'll pass out in the street and get robbed!! [...] it's often to unfamiliar places - like one-time appointments etc - rather than something like grocery shopping at the same supermarket twice a week. [...] I've been unable to do any work with this appointment hours from now hanging over me, and chances are I won't until after it's over, then when I get back I'll probably be too exhausted to do much of anything! [...] the thought of getting lost, that consumes my mind."
yes,I have a lot of anxiety and I'm scared to leave the house 75% of the time because I'd rather stay home and miss out on things than get a panic attack in public. I wish I could go to the aquarium with my sister and not have to freak out for 3 days beforehand and wonder if I'll panic on the way there. I haven't been to the ocean in almost a decade. My dad moved to Florida last spring and he's been begging me to come see him (I live in New England) and I wish I could.
yes,"I battle every day, agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, PTSD, dysphoria, chronic illness & disability. I've felt like a failure as a 26 year old guy who dropped out of college to have surgery for his autoimmune disease & never came back bc his anxiety ate him alive & he can't leave his apartment anymore."
yes,"I have agoraphobia, anxiety, ocd and depression and I can barely leave my house. I spend most of my day trying to stave off my anxiety and by the time I'm calmed down, I wasted an entire day.  I'm exhausted and I wake up anxious and the cycle starts again."
yes,I flip out and start thinking the worst... I pysically could not move when he knocked on the door. I get wide eyed and heart rate goes to 120. I start sweating and just plan got scared.
yes,"I've been diagnostiqued with agoraphobia in 2020 and since that moment I started woirking on myself with a therapist and some pills. Now, in 2024, I still working even harder than before and all I see is physic and mental tiredment, but not any advance in my condition."
yes,"I have severe social anxiety and I don’t like to leave my home for the most part. if my anxiety is lower, I am able to go to a grocery store or a place more secluded that I’m comfortable with maybe the beach but other than that anything with more than five people in an uncontrolled environment I get panic attacks. I just have a hard time getting really close to men to want to date so I friendzone or ghost because of agoraphobia and the fear of being emotionally abandoned again."
yes,"i can hardly even sit still in my damn doctors office without having a panic attack for 30 minutes. I literally barely made it through my last appointment, crying throughout the whole thing and my heart just racing. i'm talking 145-160bmp according to their readings."
yes,Nothing seems real anymore.
yes,"Agoraphobia has stolen my life away from me, and I feel like I'm pretending 24/7 or putting up a show for everyone so they don't feel uncomfortable about my bad mental health. I'm scared of so many things: what if I never get better, what if I get worse, what if I have to drop out of my dream school, what if nobody can truly love me because my illness is just too much."
yes,I struggle with agrophobia who has struggled leaving the house ever since covid I have up and downs but I went outside twice yesterday
yes,i’ve been having bad intrusive thoughts and they won’t go away. my body just feels like it needs out of this situation.
yes,"I still get anxious. I still have moments where I don't want to go out and into work, but it subsides quickly once I'm there. I still put off some tasks, like errands or grocery shopping, but I am getting better. I've worked through *so* much trauma. I don't have panic attacks just thinking about simply going onto my porch to get the mail. I am no longer bound to my home. I have made positive changes in my life. I have come so far."
yes,I get really nervous that other people are going to see me and judge me for some reason.
yes,"It was very difficult, but I faced the fear and survived."
yes,I get physically ill when I leave home. Bad stomach issues and in general feel like shit.
yes,I started getting anxious and went further but had to pull over. I waited but didn't fully feel better and started heading home. I started to feel better but felt like I failed... I started getting really anxious and figured it would pass but it didn't so I pulled over again. I waited but the anxiety stayed about the same so I just went home while still anxious.
yes,"I'll have no anxiety during my exposures for a week or two, then one day I'm terrified the whole time, then the next day is fine doing the same exact thing."
yes,"I feel so disgusting and useless, like i have no energy whats so ever, and im such a dissapointment, i dont know why i just dont do the exposure. Im just feeling hopeless and like there is no end."
yes,i think that the lockdown in 2020 made my anxiety of leaving the house worse. i saw how nice it was to not leave my house and i think im struggeling since then.
yes,He suffers from agoraphobia and anxiety and rarely goes out (only for work 10 min away from home). In the last years he had lots of ups and downs. But when there is a stressful situation his anxiety always gets worse.
yes,I haven't been wanting to eat or do much which is not good since it always boosted my mood since it kept me busy. I keep accidentally letting myself get dehydrated. I think it also partially caused me agoraphobia in the first place because I got heat stress or something and threw up because of it a few times in the past and have gotten vertigo from it.
yes,"feeling unsafe and just generally having a bad time because I hate being out in public or around other people, or even perceived at all much of the time."
yes,"I (27F) have been on a slow decline into agoraphobia since 5 years ago when I started dealing with chronic illness and passed out behind the wheel while driving. ... I’m not sure what to do at this point, it’s becoming clear I can’t rely on them to help me with exposure."
yes,"I feel like people will think i look weird. I was about to go for a walk, I put on some clothes and looked in the mirror and I’ve decided I can’t go out because nothing i have looks okay on me anymore."
no,"Just wanted to share a bit of a positive story to show things WILL and CAN get better. I go through periods of being agoraphobic, and it is massively influenced by the fact that I have health problems and also do have health anxiety. I was due to go on week long a school trip abroad, to a country I have never been to before with 20 other students who I had never met. I had not been leaving the house at all in the weeks leading up to the trip, and was having daily panic attacks because I was genuinely so scared about the thought of actually having to leave my house for a week, abroad and with strangers. I almost cancelled and I didn’t sleep for a week leading up to the trip. However, I forced myself to go. ..."
yes,I feel completely lost and terrified... My confidence is shattered... I feel like I've lost part of myself inside...
yes,"I have been in a near constant state of fight or flight. ... I start to feel my heart rate begin to rise, my muscles tense up and a sense of panic takes over. ... Even at night I’m not at peace as I typically get about 5 hours of sleep. I constantly wake up in the early hours out of breath and in cold sweats. ... When I start conversations, my mind goes blank, my face turns red and words become “thick” to spit out and I begin to shake. ... I honestly wish I was never born. These mental hurdles are just too much for me and I’m sick of this shit."
yes,I have agoraphobia... feel trapped and know I can not get up and leave without everyone looking at me... just the thought of this makes my heart race. I’m currently sitting in bed crying because of how scary the thought of being there is... I took it and it didn’t work I just balled my eyes out and couldn’t even get out the car to go inside the venue... Any feeling of nauseous or anxious makes me feel like I’m gonna throw up which makes the anxiousness worse and turns it into a panic attack.
yes,"suffering with agoraphobia, but do you know what got you to the point of not being able to leave your home?"
yes,"I struggle to get myself to leave the house, often taking anywhere from half an hour to three hours to hype myself up to leave if I am successful at all. It has gotten to the point where I'm missing classes and putting off things like going to the supermarket. I don't have panic attacks but I do feel very anxious in public and even in shared spaces with my housemates."
yes,"I cannot explain how lonely I feel, I have no family or friends and I simply have no plans to make any. I can't even imagine having a friend at this point, I don't think I could handle it. My muscles haven't been used for so long that I can't walk much because I get exhausted so fast. I normally average around 150-200 steps a day, and it's been like that since I stopped leaving home I suppose."
yes,"I feel so messed up in my head... I'm depressed, angry and sad... I want to lash out... My OCD thoughts drive me insane."
yes,anxiety hit… ended up taking one of my Ativan. Started to cry in front of my friend. Told him I’m going back to the car and left him to get himself food while I made a fool of myself. Sitting in my car unsure where I go from here. I’m starting to feel defeated.
yes,"Around 2-3 weeks ago, I had the worst anxiety attack I've ever experienced on my way to attending a sporting event... Since then, I have left the house a couple of times to do simple quick tasks in my local neighbourhood, which has been met with a bit of anxiety... 1) I cannot be away from my house for long periods of time... 2) I cannot be physically in an away space for long... 3) From both of those two experiences, once I knew I was on my way home, and as my eta to home got shorter, I would less and less anxious. Almost instantly I would have those feelings alleviate. And of course, once I am home and when I am home I feel completely okay... As of only a month ago I have never felt these sorts of feelings before and feel so very lost and confused about it all."
yes,"I always do everything alone and I flopped no one gives a fuck about how lonely I feel, how broke I am, Im sick of living a miserable life why should I even bother to carry on living. My haemoglobin always drops whenever i cry and lack of oxygen makes me sick and weak. My legs hurt I sit so much on my bed"
no,
yes,I believe my core fear is public embarrassment
yes,My panic disorder would eat me alive like it did my mom when she found out she had lung cancer.
no,
yes,So anxious about getting a haircut right now. Don’t know why but is what it is. I AM DOING THIS SHIT.
no,"So I have been in exposure therapy everyday for a couple weeks now, and I’ll like to share a bit about what I’ve learned. I’ve went from being nearly home bound to being quite functional. I am not recovered, however I can now drive in cars, busses, go to stores, eat fast food etc. The only fears I have left to target really are being in restaurants and being on highways. ..."
yes,I was extremely outgoing.
yes,"I get panic quite often when in certain car parks, but others are fine - it doesnt make sense lol. Some shops set me off, others dont, and they're mostly similar. The sky bothers me in certain open places, yet I can walk around a field or open nature park fine with no issues."
no,It’s been harder for me to get to and from my work place so I was wondering if anyone knows of any credible stay at home jobs?
yes,"If I'm gonna panic, what to do."
yes,"Every 10 segs I thought about turning back. I was afraid I couldn't panic. I tried to keep my breathing slow and deep. I try to reassure myself everything would be OK, on success of failure. ... I started to feel my heart racing. I tried to breath slowly but couldn't. I entered the card and started to feel suffocating. It was a panic attack."
yes,"I struggle with leaving the house every day. Seeing people and getting treated rudely can really set off a spiral for me. I will try to leave the house, then begin to pace, and do everything I can to make myself feel okay before leaving. Most of the time it doesn’t work and I sit at home being disappointed in who I am nowadays. I broke down crying in front of about 10 people... I can’t even bring myself to call the Medicaid people so that I can see a professional, because I always cry and tell them I have to call them back."
yes,"I haven’t left the house in over a year and a half, I’m just really scared."
yes,I feel so trapped at work even at 15hrs a week. My agoraphobia wouldn't be debilitating
yes,"I've been agoraphobic since I can remember, and it doesn't get any easier. Within 5 minutes, 7 people have stared me down/turned around to get a second look.... as usual, I panic and leave with 3 items."
no,I know this is usually the hardest time since we can't go to our family gathering. But just remember you're not the only one. If anybody wants to chat hit me up. Again Merry Christmas
yes,i don’t leave my house much because of this disorder...i can’t find anyone near me that doesn’t seem really scary.
yes,"I felt terrified and nauseas but I did it and I am so proud of myself. I have lived with this for 6 years at varying degrees of severity, but this year has been the hardest for me and my mental health."
yes,A few weeks ago I actually thought death was my only way out
yes,"I have severe CPTSD, it all started when I got laced weed my sophomore year of high school. Ever since then anytime I would go into a big store like a target or a Walmart I would dissociate and black out for a few seconds and it would scare me so bad because I didn’t know what it was. my heart would drop and I would run to the car. ...I feel so lost because every time I try to get myself some exposure I panic and cry and won’t even let my boyfriend pull out of the driveway. ...i want to. i just get so terrified of that death feeling."
yes,"I stay in my room, in bed all day, either watching something, playing games, or on my phone, it almost always in bed... i walk a maximum of 600 steps a day and i know its bad but i feel like there is nothing else to do with my time that isnt sedentary without leaving my house."
yes,"I explained to her the panic attacks that led to agoraphobia, and how I still haven't stepped foot into a store since November. I apologized for any inconvenience, but told her I was desperate for help, because this has become debilitating."
yes,"I (M 26) have been largely agoraphobic since about December 2022. Basically, a few years of financial, social, and mental hardship all culminated in a string of visceral panic attacks that largely stole my ability to drive more than a few blocks from my home. I’ve been as to maintain living on my own with a roommate by discovering I had a knack for writing, but many other facets of my life are depressing and I live every day as if it’s the same. I know the way out for the most part, but I have zero motivation to do it."
yes,I can't be home alone bc my anxiety is too much. I am so scared. I am so scared I will lose my mind and lose my kids. I don't want to lose mt kids but I am a frickin loser. I can't work bc im so scared to do anything.
yes,I panicked and rescheduled it for today because taking my car in means I’m stuck sitting in the Tim Hortons next door for at least an hour since there’s no feasible way for me to go back home in between. The having to stay out in public was the terrifying barrier for me... I was pretty shaky and kept having triggering thoughts (my agoraphobia stems from my ptsd and my fear of having a breakdown in public) but I was able to shut them down and just focus on my phone.
yes,"I developed GAD about 4 years ago, and after a super rough last year, it’s developed into panic/agoraphobia! I’m still cycling through medication trying to find one that works super well and I also started taking testosterone. Apparently my hormones were out of wack and low T can cause panic attacks and excess worry in men."
yes,I want to turn back time
yes,I don’t dare to go outside so I decided to post something...I am so scared I don’t dare to open my door or go outside alone or even be seen with the curtains open. The smallest things trigger.
yes,First panic attack was at the hairdressers. Always need an exit. Recently year or so stopped driving on motorways after the realisation I can’t just stop/trapped. Many other symptoms but they all lead to acrophobia.
yes,"I have this huge phobia of bugs. I developed this fear in 2020 and up until recently it hasn't been a huge bother unless a bug was in my house, car, or on me while outside. I stress about even letting my dog outside because a wasp may get in (and has before) making it hard to even guarantee my house is safe."
yes,I freaked out on BART and left after only sitting and watching the trains come and go for a bit
yes,I felt sick... I was to aware of my surrounding. Too much noise. So many people. So many cars. It overwhelmed me so much that I started to feel so anxious. By the time I went home I felt so sweaty and panicky.
yes,"I get so fucking anxious riding in a car in general, and the fact that my relative is the one that’s going to pick me up to get me to their house makes it even worse. I have horrible fight or flight reactions that make me feel like I’m going to jump out of the moving vehicle. I have a really hard time keeping myself distracted because I get awful intrusive thoughts during my attacks."
yes,I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder almost 6 years ago. And this year I developed Agoraphobia.
yes,"I've had Agoraphobia for years, but was somewhat managing it by couponing."
yes,"I’ve had agoraphobia, panic disorder, and severe anxiety for a very long time. When I explain that I have agoraphobia, I get responses like “you went to cvs yesterday?” Or “you go out places with your husband” (a “safe person”)."
yes,"I feel like people are mocking or staring at me, thinking I'm strange or weird, or try to act friendly while actually gossiping about me. ... I constantly feel gross and ugly... I get extreme anxiety. ... I have a crippling fear that a photo or video of me will be spread outside my family and everyone will laugh and mock me and I just won't know it."
yes,"Cried, freaked, thought I was dying..."
yes,"No where is safe. The police are unhinged. Everyone is angry and yelling, hurting, killing one another"
yes,"My Agoraphobia is bad, I haven't even stepped into the garden. I went out for Balloons... I think the rain helped a lot because there are less people about, but I went out and into a shop!!"
yes,"I'm a fairly sized masculine person, muscular as I work labor and am athletic, and have a whole bunch of tattoos. when I panic, it can easily be said that I appear intimidating, despite my actual gentle nature. cops kill folks like us often and it's barely a blip in the news..."
yes,I haven't left my apartment in nearly two months.  I feel very reluctant.
yes,"For years I have struggled with getting out of my house, sometimes being house bound for weeks or months at a time. Every day I fight the voice in my head that tells me that the four walls in my room are the safest place to be and that an outing will be the end."
yes,"I’ve been working through panic attacks and agoraphobia for the last 4ish years. It’s had ups and downs and lately it’s been very down. I feel like I’m constantly checking for anxiety, I don’t even know how to just think about something else."
yes,"I do understand that most of these people may not be aware of what agoraphobia is...I mean, i’m not proud of choosing to stay homebound this long either, i’m just really having a hard time right now."
yes,"I thought I was having a heart attack. I got out of breath at the exact same spot and had to turn back, then my breath came back, then I turned back to the station and it returned again. It’s really hard to ‘keep going’ when you’re almost gasping for air and your brain is telling you that you’re going to drop dead in the street any second…"
yes,My biggest fear is being like those weird people with serious mental disease that you sometimes encounter in the streets that yell and do inappropriate things or worse become a crazy lunatic criminal. I get bombarded by intrusive thoughts about doing something inappropriate. ...my primary fears of going crazy in public get so much more real when I am walking alone like the crazy people do.
yes,My anxiety gets me. I know to keep pushing. I try to accept it but it’s till hard.
yes,"when I'm even a little anxious, I start trembling *super* bad, and then I get even more anxious about people noticing the trembling"
yes,"since my agoraphobia started about 3 months ago I’ve only been able to go into costco if I had taken an ativan beforehand, today I went in not medicated at all! Feel really good about it but definitely getting some post-exposure anxiety."
yes,"I suffer from agoraphobia since I was 16 years old. my parents won't take me to psychiatrist and they still yell to me that everything is find, 'it will go away'. I can't really deal with it anymore"
yes,"I’ve developed diagnosed agoraphobia in Dec 2019. It was hard for me to leave the house or go to social occasions without crippling panic attacks. In 2020, I couldn’t even get in a moving car without having a panic attack that made me feel like I got hit by a car."
yes,"I wake up most days afraid to go out and spend the day painfully getting through tasks with my little support systems. Trying to make it one step at a time. Then some days I feel pretty good and I do do quite a bit, effortlessly really."
yes,I haven't stepped out of my house in 9 years. I keep all my windows closed and I don't want my neighbours or anyone else besides my parents to see me. I don't even play video games or watch movies anymore. I sleep whole day and stay awake all night just living like a zombie. I get really bad panic attacks when I think how many years I have wasted and what will happen when my parents pass away.
no,"Yep, I took the bus!"
yes,My main issue is agoraphobia that comes along with OCD and adhd. I'm currently on Citalopram which I don't feel is working that well.

yes,Sheila from shameless. She slowly exposes herself to going outside
yes,my postcard collecting has recently helped me WANT to go to antique shops again

yes,the main character is agoraphobic
no,Not sure about movies but there are a few shows that have them
no,"Bunny and the Bull is an interesting and fun movie, kinda wonky representation though."
no,Welcome Matt w/ Tahj Mowry.
no,Pretty sure that’s not a thing… in movies… and especially not in real life.
yes,His world is very small due to his anxiety disorder so has remained disconnected from people and actually antisocial.
no,Copycat with Sigourney Weaver.  Older film but a seriously great thriller! Highly recommend!!
yes,"she had some issue with germs, never knew she was agoraphobic"
yes,Every time someone called her “crazy” it hurt too much cause I knew people were saying that about me.
no,Love this response. ❤
no,I thought of her right away.
no,I was also going to suggest shameless. I love Sheila!
yes,I loved how accurately she portrayed agoraphobia and how hard recovery is.
no,"That's so cool! I really love that, thank you for sharing ♡ I haven't seen any movies about it yet but I was wondering if it would help me see the whole thing in a new perspective"
no,I used to collect them too. I miss getting them. I didn't even think about that. I hope you make it out to those shops soon!
no,Thanks <3 <3
yes,feeling down about how my process is going
no,I’m loving still up so far!
no,People with agoraphobia can recover why would you say that
no,Tf are you on about
no,What?
no,"been recovering for 3 years and everyday is progress but now i’m able to go in the car for over an hour, be away from home for several days, go into very few stores and go on walks. recovery is very possible. I used to have panic attacks in 5 minute car rides and nearly faint in stores. it is very manageable now, don’t discourage others because you are set in your ways."
no,Yeah I love that movie!!
yes,"Other characters think she’s just lazy and crazy (especially by her husband) which imo was a great touch because I think a lot of us with agoraphobia have been called lazy and crazy before, so it felt really relatable!"
no,Exactly!!
no,yayyyy!!!
no,Life experience?
no,Just ignore him.
error,No subreddit submission text provided
no,Just because you haven't recovered doesn't mean others can't
yes,"i still struggle, and making lasting connections continues to be difficult."
yes,"i’m sorry you’re hurting, but lashing out at your peers who are trying to help won’t soothe that hurt."
yes,I was able to relate to sheila's character and there was both progress and set-backs shown throughout her journey. She would plan out routes and count her steps.
yes,"I don't even know me ... Left with less ability is that right ... I scream help, i been put on a peculiar shelf ... left to this test thats deminishing health"
yes,"I feel like my recovery is constantly getting held back by this subconcious fear of what other people think of me if I go out and had a full blown panic attack in front of them. I would try going out to a mall and staying there for a while but as soon as I feel panic creeping in, my brain starts trying to search for places to hide in and wait out the panic."
yes,"I feel like I'm at my breaking point. I've missed out on most of my teen years by sitting in the house. I feel like the damage has already been done and it's too late to live my life as a teen, I feel left behind. Sometimes I just wish my life could be over so I don't have to go through this pain of missing out."
yes,I had to go to the pharmacy on my own and it’s only like five minutes away but I feel amazing it’s baby steps.
yes,"wearing a cap pulled a little down, so I don’t get too overwhelmed by everything with a face cover on so I don’t feel anxious about people asking what’s wrong with the panic on my face. Just scared people will think I’m weird and say stuff to me"
yes,I could go on. This morning I either had a major panic attack or maybe I have some deficiency myself but I felt like fainting and been lying down all day.
yes,My aspergers and depression seems to contribute to me spending years in the house.
yes,"I have mild agoraphobia.. I am able to leave the house without problems.. but there are situations I just can’t do, such as taking the underground, crossing a long bridge, driving on a long highway, being stuck in the car in a traffic, and walking in large open spaces."
yes,"I did however have to keep whispering comforting phrases to myself. I'm completely spent, but I got home safe, and took my prn anxiety meds."
yes,"Anxiety attack, crying, and I must've looked like a tweaker because I would yelp every time a car went by"
yes,"I feel so much stress most of the time that I don't even feel like I'm 'there', life just doesn't feel real. It's like I'm completely depersonalized and derealized most of the time, and I know for me it comes from trauma and constant pressure because I don't live in a peaceful environment"
yes,"I had a panic attack this morning because I have to go out to the doctor today amongst other things, last time they had to read my heartbeat multiple times and couldn't get a normal score because I was wigging out. When I'm outside I feel very disassociative, have chest pains and tension to an extreme degree any time I have to go outside. Recently it's started to dive into full blown panic attacks that knock me on my butt, even though I'm high functioning in those situations. Talking to people even online can be straight up terrifying even if the convo is extremely normal."
yes,I was homebound for 9 years with exposure failures until this year. Almost every single exposure I've had has been hard. ...I have cptsd... I've noticed is that I'm more confident. I can actually handle this and *nearly every single exposure* hasn't been even remotely enjoyable.
yes,Panic disorder / agoraphobia sufferer of 12 years here. I’m confined to a (very small) selection of ‘safe spaces’.
yes,my brain usually runs to “no” or “why even ask me” because most of my friends know about my agoraphobia
yes,I had a panic attack. I’ll take some benzos today... I feel a bit nervous but no panicking.
yes,"I’ve had agoraphobia coming up 2 years now, I’m that time the severity has ranged from being bed bound to being able to drive 25 minutes away from my house and even bus to local shops. My anxiety got a lot worse in February/ March again which was so frustrating and DPDR was kicking my ass."
yes,"I started gradual exposure therapy 2 months with daily walks and started off circling around my road and going just 2 minutes from the house and then slowly building up. Today, I walked 32 minutes from my house to my local highstreet and went into a small shop... Along the highstreet I did panic a little bit but it disappeared pretty quickly and walked back home fine."
yes,I often go weeks without leaving my property outside of necessary errands...Along with meds and therapy I am able to push through discomfort and leave the house for big events/when absolutely necessary.
yes,I have a lot of trouble socializing and sometimes even eating without it...I was so anxious being away from home and I needed something to blunt it
yes,i’m just having a really hard time with agoraphobia and it’s so hard to explain to people who don’t really understand. i feel really alone in my thoughts and feel like i’m missing out on so many events bc of anxiety. i feel so shitty. it’s been like 4 months like this.
no,Not sure if this type of post is allowed but I could use a friend through this. I want to explore and navigate and learn with someone who deals with the same things I do and I want to overcome it (individually obv) but also with someone. Someone to help keep me in check while I do the same for them! Anyone looking for a friend? 
yes,"I stopped going out of the house on weekends after my boyfriend was murdered in 2017 ... I didn’t feel safe anymore. ... I would usually end up getting verbally violent with people because I was so fearful and felt like an animal trapped in a cage. ... I felt like I was a danger on the road as well, because the fear consumed me and I couldn’t be rational and make logistical decisions. ... I have to rest for 24 hours because I’m exhausted and mentally fried. ... I think that’s because of all the mental energy it takes for me to appear normal and in control. ... I was so exhausted when I got home I went to bed at 4pm and slept through the next day. ... I try to wear earbuds and listen to music when I leave the house as it helps soothe my brain. ..."
yes,I have panic attacks even being in a car for ten minutes. I feel pretty hopeless with agoraphobia.
no,Huge milestone. I'm so proud.
yes,"I have difficulty in public areas... I quit my job in January because anxiety was affecting my job performance and my manager suggested I leave, this took a huge hit at me when I thought I was getting better... I want to feel normal again and not be anxious going out in public."
yes,I rather feel the pain of social anxiety and judgement than take an isolated route
yes,I feel horrible... everything is going downhill..finances everything I'm struggling . I seriously have no self esteem anymore and it kills me to see how many opportunities have been gone due to this
yes,Haven't gone out in years... crippling anxiety/fear
yes,Want to throw myself out the window
no,Were you quiet in school or extrovert?
yes,Mine are definitely from cptsd
yes,I have a pretty bad fear of heights as well as agoraphobia so every single part about this is looking like genuine hell to me.
yes,I’m struggling a lot... I feel horrible. I spent the past two hours crying and feeling miserable. I just feel like I keep failing and it sucks so bad and I feel like the only person in the world like this... I’m so freaked out on every end and possibility.
yes,"I have struggled with agoraphobia and health anxiety since March 2022, I started to feel lightheaded and before I even got the chance to process what was happening, I fainted and woke up about a minute later on the ground. ... i’m not over exaggerating when i say i’ve been dizzy every single day since August 9th, 2022. the dizziness is also accompanied by many many other symptoms. a list of all the symptoms i experience are: dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, headaches, extreme fatigue, heat flashes, air hunger, head pressure, + many more im sure i’m leaving out. ... i have now been diagnosed with agoraphobia and have turned completely introverted. i pretty much lost all contact with friends + family and only leave the house when i absolutely have to. "
no,"for a few weeks prior to this I ""trained"" myself by hanging out in my backyard for half an hour per day. just to get used to being outside my room.
well today for the first time in months I actually went totally outside my house to a very closeby local park with somebody.
I meditated and did some breathing exercises beforehand.
We sat at a bench and talked about music. I surprisingly had zero panic attacks the entire time.
I was surrounded by random people and somehow that felt more comforting than not, at least in this moment... and I'm not a people person. I got to see their chill vibes and it sort of rubbed off on me that everything is ok and everybody is minding their own business having fun.
I even went a tiny bit further than comfortable with and was surprised I didn't even freak out internally.
Happy that I made some progress for the first time in a long time, maybe in the coming days I'll push myself a little bit further and walk down a few blocks and be outside for longer time with more distance. I really enjoyed the smell of nature, I haven't had that experience in a very long time.
I feel more excited than anxious right now, I'm starting to feel like my ""old self again"" right now. I have a very bring it on attitude right now and will try to ease more into progress."
yes,I'd feel comfortable enough to get them instead...they're so good at picking up on my anxiety
yes,"For the past 3 months my mental health has been particularly bad, affecting all areas of my life.  I woke up afraid this morning, but knew if I didn't spend any real time in the kitchen today, I probably wouldn't until the autumn when the days get darker again."
yes,"i’m a diagnosed, medicated agoraphobe (17f) who recently had a major setback which has left me housebound. i’m terrified to even talk on the phone let alone have people come into my safe space (i have a fear of not being able to escape certain situations) and my psychiatrist and another doctor are coming to my house to see me and i’m quite nervous about it and i’ve been panicking all week"
no,"I wouldn't say solved, but i can go out, make international trips, and although I do still have panic attacks, they're much more manageable for me. My agoraphobia was caused/exacerbated by an incompetent, abusive psychiatric team (CAMHS), and I spent 2 years housebound in my late teens. When I was 20, I got a great adult psychiatrist, who started me on SNRIs (was previously taking SSRIs, which do nothing for me), and that combined with daily exposure therapy got me into recovery about 2 months later. I'm on a slightly different medication regimen now (take venlafaxine instead of duloxetine, quit mirtazapine, and now carry benzos just in case and for long trips/flights), but I'm in a p good place, I went to uni 2hrs away, went to turkey last year, and I go out in my hometown every day. If you need any further info you can pm me"
yes,"5 years of never leaving my house and experiencing severe panic attacks every time I would try, as well as a constant mainline anxiety that caused physical symptoms even while at home."
yes,"I was forced out of my home and had to move in to my brother's girlfriend's home for a few months. ...It was basically exposure therapy, and it was the most normal I had felt in years. Eventually I moved out because my mum found a place and I fell back into old habits"
yes,"I wouldn't say solved, either. Managed is the way I put it... I think of it more like something like diabetes. I can't avoid exposure every day or allow myself to lose the gains I've earned by staying in the house for a couple of weeks and expect to be where I was. It's a life of diligence and consistency, especially when it comes to exposure."
yes,I still am super anxious when I go out because of social anxiety
no,I too wanna know
yes,"6 years without being able to just go in my street (was having insane unstoppable panic attacks with 200bpm heart, difficulty to breath and so on)"
yes,"I still have many days where it’s hard to get out...Being easy on myself when I do have days where I can’t bring myself to go out. If you push yourself too much, it just makes it harder. So you just have to take baby steps...playing in your head what you’re going to do outside the house helps you mentally prepare. Just don’t psych yourself out, if you catastrophize just tell yourself it’s an unrealistic scenario and give yourself some time to calm down."
yes,"Sitting in front of an open window, sitting outside with a cup of hot tea, and walking at night were my first steps. I learned how to compartmentalize my emotions. If I was anxious and scared, I could put a pin in that and feel it later. Avoidance of a thing conditions you that that thing is something to be afraid of, and everytime I avoid going somewhere I feel agoraphobia slipping back in."
no,"Yeah, but I didn’t really do anything… it just faded away on its own after some time passed"
no,I know its good inspiration for me so it must be for others. I hope to see more people getting better and when I do I'll be sure to update too.
no,I just wanted to know if anyone here went to any church by themselves. I want to go but I want to kind of know what to expect. This would be my first time alone. Thanks.
yes,I was so preoccupied with actually being out among people that I didn't check the weather. ... It was wonderful to see but a pretty pathetic comment on how out of touch with life I've been.
yes,"Many people whom have never experienced what we have, have been having a very hard time with staying inside, not being able to go to the places they're used to going to because they're closed, etc."
yes,I’ve been taking 40mg 3 times a day every day as prescribed by my doctor for a while now. I’m starting to worry about it affecting my heart and my blood pressure. My mum also said she read somewhere that it worsens anxiety over time.
yes,I managed to contain my 3 panic attacks. I did it you guys. I didn't let it win. I'm crying happy tears
yes,"core memories of people, both family and strangers, being just awful"
yes,I couldn't go anywhere without my partner of 17 years going with me and even then I still got panic attacks.
yes,"Any time I leave my house I forget to breathe and have constant panic attacks until I’m back at home. I was clenching my entire body and felt so sick and dizzy from the panic, but I got through it."
yes,"I have been trying to find a work from home job...it’s starting to really upset and depress me...I just want to be a functioning adult and earn some money so I can pay my bills, get therapy and maybe start moving towards an independent life before I’m 30."
yes,"I still deal with the fear of being trapped... I am realizing anxiety is such a small part of this. Mostly, I just dont like 'out there'. it's overstimulating. Its too bright, too busy, too loud. I have proprioception and vestibular disorders that make it hard for me to move fast, keep up, stay steady."
yes,"I’ve been agoraphobic off and on all my life. ...The pandemic was the worst, divorce and my child went no contact. Ended up in inpatient for a hot minute due to the divorce trauma..."
yes,"I've been dancing around it for a month or so, looking for good places to go and practice on Google maps and half-heartedly telling my husband I want to try it on the weekends but then backing out. I was shaking like a leaf, but I decided to try and if I needed to stop right away, be fine with it and try again another time."
yes,i still struggle and i’m in a slump rn - no motivation to go out:
yes,"I have dealt with crippling anxiety about driving and riding in vehicles. ... I would try to make excuses to avoid things he was going to drive me to. ... I would also sometimes experience anxiety at the movie theater ... I have never been given any sort of diagnosis, not Agoraphobia or Generalized Anxiety Disorder or anything related to my anxiety despite how it is bad enough to impact my life so heavily."
yes,it makes me feel out of it and I start to question my reality more often
no,Do you guys have any tips for a hour and a half drive? My family is going on vacation and I don’t have to go but I’d really love to. I really don’t want to miss out. They’re leaving in a few hours and I have to decide whether or not I go :(
yes,"i couldn’t walk down my road to the postbox or go into a shop, i was so inactive and was doing less than 1000 steps a day because i stayed in my house."
yes,"fear of death like a heart attack or something that you can’t “save” yourself quickly by not being in your comfortable space, my fear comes down to having something happen to me in a place I can’t be saved"
yes,I have the kind of agoraphobia where I can’t go anywhere alone and I always need a safe person to go with me. I’m tired of always relying on other people to make me feel safe.
yes,"Instead of thinking about home when you go out,think about outside when you go outside."
yes,I stopped working out a few months ago due to comfort zone in my housebound situation and it was a big mistake. I'm sitting with a lower back pain for a few days because I had something to do that requires back effort.
yes,I was pretty anxious but I did it and I didn’t bail once I got there.
yes,"I have a hard time believing I can get out of this, my family refuses to understand the big hole that I find myself in thanks to this illness. I'm able to go to class, maybe go to a quick grocery shopping or go to the drug store around my city...I can't visit my grandma who lives close by or if I manage to go, it takes a lot of effort and medication for me to keep it together while being there."
no,A year ago I was terrified of everything. I couldn't walk out of my house. I couldn't even have people in my house. I was scared to shower. I was suicidal and sure that I would never recover.
yes,i have such a fear of passing out or having a panic attack that i sadly don’t feel as optimistic as i did a few days ago.
yes,I don't have any money
no,"This time last year I couldn’t leave the house. I was really struggling mentally and emotionally and was at one of the lowest points of my life. I drove around the neighborhood to get used to driving again and went out a bit further each time. I finally made it to the college I went to and when school started up again in August I went back to club meetings like I did before covid. I reconnected with friends and made many more great friends and I even told them once we connected more about my struggle with agoraphobia and they were super supportive. I went to restaurants again and even went to a club for my birthday and had so much fun. I met a really great guy and I am falling in love with him and I love going out and doing things with him. The biggest thing I have done is move out of my parents place!!! I really thought I would freak out and panic like I did before when I was going to move into the dorms but ended up not doing it because of my anxiety. I just started a new job and this restaurant and bar and it’s a lil sketchy with drunk men which does scare me a little but I work with friends that I met at school and everyone there is super nice. I guess I just want to say that it does get better eventually, please hang in there and take baby steps and soon enough you will fly❤️"
yes,"I've been having ups and downs with agoraphobia for many years, supermarkets and grocery shops have always been the most difficult thing to me. ...Since the beginning of this year I went to the grocery shop with one of my parents a couple of times, it would still make me nervous, but I had to try. ...So when my dad needed something, my first instinct was ignore the message and then be like 'sorry, I couldn't go', but suddenly I felt some adrenaline and was like 'you know what? I can do it!'"
yes,I went into Publix alone without even telling anyone I was going for the first time in FIVE years by myself! Holy moly!
no,How’s it going
no,Good for you!  You should be very proud of yourself!
no,Congrats
no,YAY congrats!
no,"Nice! good job, take it one step at a time 🙏"
no,"Congrats! You must feel great, and I am happy for you! My girlfriend is gong through the same situation right now and we are working on it with daily exercises. She is also making a ton of progress and it's nice to see that other people are doing it too :) ..."
no,AYEEEEEEE
yes,Dpdr comes hard with anxiety
no,Thank you!!

no,"Hey, just a quick question would you say that exposure therapy is the only way out? Please comment your recovery stories or other ways that you have gotten out of this panic cycle. I’m feeling pretty hopeless right now and I’m only 20 years old and it seems like my life is falling apart so I would love it if you guys could please leave a comment. Thank you"
yes,pushed all my anxious “nausea” thoughts aside and did it.
yes,"I have agoraphobia...I want to minimize my symptoms as much as possible, because if I show any signs of panic I will make my family angry."
yes,Over the past three years or so I've had trouble leaving my house except when I'm going to my parents home or when I'm with them. I can barely walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. As for taking out the trash to the dumpster down the road - that's impossible.
yes,"My main symptoms are as of this moment: - Hyperventilation - Fast heart rate - Shaky hands. I only fear the embarrasement, so mainly I get these symptoms when I know I cannot walk away from people like in public transports or in a plane."
yes,"I spent the last 2 weeks stressing about this appointment, and the last week doing exposure therapy every. Single. Day."
yes,went in 7/11 again and this time got a slurpee and then drove further away than I ever have!! Feeling proud and like I’m finally making progress!! ... sat in tacos bell drive thru and at a gas station which both make me feel trapped!! Today was the best exposure I’ve ever had and I’m feeling confident!!
yes,I've been dealing with this phobia for years... Hearing traffic outside makes my heart race. I'm so depressed I can barely do anything... I'm trapped. I'm useless and I'll never be okay. This world doesn't have a place for me. I can't find for myself. I'm alone.
yes,I’ve had agoraphobia since the pandemic started and I started experiencing panic attacks. My husband became my safe person and I was unable to leave to house without him
yes,I have no idea why being in the car is so tough for me but once I’m there it dies down and I can move past it after a while. I don’t even really have anxious thoughts for the ride it’s just like my body starts freaking out?
yes,"I can't even take a small walk alone. I can be at my own yard, I can visit my parents and my relatives who live in the same city (as long as I go by the car, I can't bike or walk anywhere), I can drive within my home city everywhere as long as I avoid highways and I can currently go to four different stores here. I'm also fine outdoors in the woods etc as long as the car isn't too far away from there. But that's pretty much all I can do currently."
no,"We’ve got this! We can overcome our anxiety. We are stronger than our irrational thoughts. Remember, we have all the power! Our mind is much more powerful than we may realize. If you are losing hope, don’t! You will triumph and be so proud of yourself for it ❤️ you are wayyyy stronger than you think !"
yes,feel guilt/shame/anxiety about not going outside like you should have
yes,"I'm tired of feeling alone, and missing out on so much. I want to take a vacation go places with my boys."
yes,"I was out with a friend today, we were sitting a bit far away from my house... I started feeling very sick to my stomach. All I wanted is to go home, I didn’t want to be outside feeling this anxious... Usually for me, I just have the urge to use the bathroom. This time, the symptoms were more severe, following nausea, shaking, disorientation and maybe DPDR... I think it’s important I mention this - this was the first thing I genuinely started suffering from (it all started when I was around 11, I was terrified from car rides and being out in general, I often wouldn’t leave the house)."
yes,I was staying at home but i wanna go back to doing little things like gym and grocery etc. Now i feel housebound again because of the side effects
yes,I still struggle A LOT some times doing the most mundane stuff like going every monday to an academy or meeting with some friend to eat
no,All alone! I’m so excited! I finally did it. I went to a thrift store and even managed to buy 10 books (which took walking around and reading blurbs and deciding). I think I’m going to try another used bookstore tomorrow to get out again.
yes,I finally took a drive around my house...I did it! It felt so nice to listen to music and drive w no traffic...I used to drive and be so peaceful but every since I started having panic attacks and being agoraphobic
yes,i was anxious but i didn’t panic at all! i told myself i was just going to do exposure therapy by sitting in the car.... then i went around the block... and then ended up enjoying the day.
yes,Occasionally I'll just have a really easy day where I don't get anxious or maybe a little bit.
yes,"I'd just assumed that everyone who didn't already have agoraphobia had developed agoraphobia since March 2020. But at almost 40, for the first time ever I've taken the step to be referred to their MH team"
no,"Hi people :) I just wanted to write this down, maybe to give others hope? I’ve had a rough childhood and when I started living by myself (3y ago) all the trauma bubbled up. I was having panic attacks, couldn’t go to school or work anymore. I got therapy and was diagnosed with agoraphobia and emetophobia. ..."
yes,"I immediately started thinking of reasons why I should say no, the main one being that my agoraphobia/anxiety manifests in my stomach and digestive system so I didn’t like the idea of attempting a walk straight after a meal."
yes,"I set a timer for myself and as my support paid for me I found myself actually making small talk with the cashier. I was shocked at what I had done, let alone actually speaking to another person."
yes,"I started having panic attacks and feeling like I was going crazy at places like the train and bus, restaurants even environments like hanging out with my friends and family. I've started to stay in my room as that's the only place I feel any comfort and feel like I have some sort of control of the emotions."
yes,i am getting awful panic attacks while getting through my day and they leave me devastated and without any hope.
yes,"my anxiety has worsened and it’s impacting me leaving the house. I find various excuses to not leave the house and sometimes they are valid. Most of the time it’s just “I can’t deal with the outside world today/people around me”. I feel like I’m a constant cycle of guilt, anxiety and being worn out."
yes,I’m to the point of not feeling able to even talk on the phone and I can barely get outside to walk my dog.
yes,I pushed myself to get to the end of the block so many times now over two or more years but in my head my goal was 'get through it' so i made it there and turned around and felt relief when I got home. Finally realized what I'm supposed to do and what is spelled out in the therapy is sitting with the anxiety until it goes down and repeating this without going any further until the time between the high and low anxiety is significantly smaller.
no,"TL; DR at the end of post. Highly recommend to read If youre being housebound.
On the occasion of the post a few hours ago where I read that someone believes that a cure is not possible for everyone: I believe recovery is possible for everyone, even though some clearly have it Harder than others.
...
AMA about my recovery journey."
yes,My severe agoraphobia symptoms started around the time my implant expired.
yes,i feel like it does nothing. my anxiety is still the same. i expressed this and she offered me a medication that is for lowering heart rate and that gave me anxiety bc i overthink and was like well what if i think im having a attack and im not and i take it and my heart rate goes to low
yes,"I didn't get out of my house without a relative in years, and now I finally did it! I was a little bit anxious at the entrance, but I took the courage and entered."
no,"This happened a few days ago but wanted to share my experience.

For about a month now I have been doing long walks 1- 1.5 hours (3-4) miles around my neighborhood every morning.

Well, I was coming to the end of my walk (about 10 mins from home), and ways down the street I could see a woman walking her small dog. Anyways I then noticed that a BIG DOG (I think a mastiff?) was loose and was trying to attack her and her little dog.

The lady was frozen and just trying to yell at the dog to go away, I could see from a distance that the big dog would run up and try to bite her little dog then back away for a moment then go back in.

I froze for a quick moment then suddenly started to run towards the lady and her dog. I carry a small pocket Tazer I bought off amazon a while back so I pulled that out. I had to run across some mild traffic. Once I got closer I yelled as loud as I could and then got the dog's attention. 

The dog then turned and ran towards me and when it got close I popped off my Tazer (it's REAL LOUD) and the dog got scared and backed off a bit. I then yelled at the lady to start walking away but then the big dog started after her again. I then yelled at the dog and he would back off, this happened a few times and lasted maybe 5-7 mins.

Then finally the big dog's owner came out of their house and the big dog ran to the owner and the situation was over. The lady with the small dog thanked me and went on her way.

I felt like I was going to pass out afterward but in the end, I had a ""natural"" flight or fight experience and everything turned out OK!

I could have easily turned down a near side street but I knew that if I had not helped her it would eat me up for a long time. I'm a grown man and abandoning someone in need like that would bring me tremendous shame.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this experience and I was able to not let my panic get the best of me. The next day I went on my walk again and I feel better knowing I can handle a tough situation."
yes,"i struggle with ibs related agoraphobia. when i need to go somewhere, i feel intense anxiety and crippling fear i will shit myself... i can't go out somewhere where i don't know where toilets are, last week i got panic attack at dentist chair because i feared i will need to go to toilet during the tooth filling, when i go out with someone, i can't eat, i don't eat outside unless i am very close to home."
no,"I'm trying to get to know / date someone with agoraphobia and I'm completely lost. I'm no stranger to mental health issues and have generalized anxiety and depression myself, and struggled with eating disorders for a long time. I'm also quite an avoidant introvert, but this is another level. I want to be supportive, but i get so frustrated of them canceling at the last minute. It makes it super hard getting to know them. I'm trying to be mindful of their challenge and respectful of their privacy but i have no idea how to deal with situations like this. I think my mental health experiences has very little in common with this. Have you ever been in a similar situation with a romantic interest / sex partner, and if so, how did you navigate it? What helped? Wtf is happening"
yes,anxiety won’t let me.
yes,"In May last year I developed a severe level of paranoia...I had no idea where to put my eyes, and anytime I was out I would look absolutely terrified...I would move my body away from people when they past me, and I started to gag out of stress whenever I was outside...My paranoia got so bad that when I heard bits of conversation I thought they were talking about me...I felt anxious being close to my window...I remember going to a corner shop 3 minutes walk away, and retching on the way back in fear...I was considering suicide at times."
yes,i had a panic attack so bad that i was throwing up
yes,"It’s like I want to go out and push myself deep down, but that depressive side is sitting there asking if it’s even worth it. Will I even have fun? What’s the point? I feel more comfortable at home. Why go out? "
yes,I constantly fear of having to use the bathroom for number 2 and even when I get a little anxious it stirs my stomach up so I fear leaving the house and having a accident.
yes,I struggle to reach the end of my road maybe 3 telephone poles... My fear does not go down with exposure... I become afraid of things that dont make sense... I freak out and break down... I keep thinking about suicide... I dont want to feel guilty for dragging people into my awful little world and Im also terrified of living in it alone.
yes,Once and a while the systems fail and the nerves build up too much and I get stuck inside... I couldnt.. get ready. Couldnt move knowing I had to go back out there... and potentially feel super incompetent...
yes,"home bound for 2 years, quit drinking alcohol a month and half ago, and started dealing with my emotions head on. Today DROVE me the wife and kids to a local bbq joint. Ate and drove back!"
yes,I spent 8 years too afraid to leave my house... I feel so much regret... I don't know how to deal with the sadness of losing 8 years of my youth.
yes,"My agoraphobia is very centered around being alone and losing control or “going crazy”. I had a panic attack during takeoff and haven’t flown since. The fear is not of flying or the plane crashing, it’s solely being alone and trapped and unable to get help."
yes,"I have experienced dizziness for over three years now that is non-spinning in nature, it is an up and down feeling like you are on an elevator, on a boat, or walking on sand as some may describe it, typically while walking, standing, or slight position adjustments while sitting or laying down. It has caused anxiety, panic attacks, shakiness, heart palpitations, arm/leg numbness, neck tingling, neck pain, muscle spasms, brain fog, hearing sensitivity, headaches, fevers, and others I am probably forgetting."
yes,"I was trembling so bad like a leaf. My issue is with driving and social situations. Once I’m in the situation for a while, I am fine. It’s the anticipation. But the shaking and trembling makes it so hard and I begin to feel defeated."
yes,"feel very much trapped in a car on freeways, intersections, turning left, and stop signs. They all get me very much anxious!"
yes,as a shy and very anxious person talking to people was so hard. I did have a bit of a panic attack but i quickly went to the back and managed to mask it and calm down slightly. I feel super depressed and exhausted after this and i feel like the anxiety is never ending.
yes,waited in a long ass waiting line for 40 mins and did adult bureaucracy stuff that i always hated and made me feel anxious. Some months ago i couldn't even leave my home..
yes,"it's just really uncomfortable to have two people so fixated on your existence to the point that they talk about you every single day. I try to be nice to everyone, I keep to myself, and I want to be left alone."
yes,"I have panic attacks and break down crying...I had a breakdown the week of thanksgiving that put me in a mental hospital for 3 days. Ive been diagnosed with general anxiety, severe depression, and agoraphobic panic disorder."
yes,I've been struggling with this since I was 20 and I'm 27 now... Life is really lonely because I barely have any friends to talk to.
yes,"i don't have a job. i'm starting to see the effects of my lifestyle (always in bed, binge drinking almost every night, insane screen time)  deteriorate my appearance. hardly leaving the house and drinking every night mixed w heavy loads of screen time has kind of turned me into a zombie. i feel so dumb. i can't communicate w people properly in person. i have been on lists of anti depressants and the only med that helped w anxiety was ofc xanax but i was scared of becoming reliant on it (which..idfk at this point i should rely on something) and also the increased chance of dementia from prolonged use of it. i've seen a few therapist's but in the end it's always just like, ppl don't care if you're awkward or weird! they're to busy thinking ab themselves! which yeah, i know. i mean to extent they don't care. but im still hyper aware of my surroundings and freaking out internally about how to walk, what face im making, if im slouching, too scared to fix my posture, etc."
yes,i was TERRIFIED... my eyes started to well up and my heart was beating so fast... i feel so embarrassed and angry at myself... i feel awful for leaving my friend behind. and i feel even worse for barely being a functioning person that can just SIT in public. i feel so pathetic and dumb.
yes,Feeling better than usual i think.
no,"I’ve only been agoraphobic for about 1.5 yrs but i got lower than i’ve ever been. the agoraphobia is in combination with OCD, Autism and depression, so overall it’s been a huge struggle."
yes,"I have to avoid coming to this page a lot of the time because I hear of my fellow sufferers issues and it is upsetting to me. Its so cruel. I can explain exactly what's happening to someone I know well and respect, and they will still make it seem like its nothing. Like I am making it up or should just suck it up."
yes,"I have periods where my answer to things is just NO. Travel / small spaces / long walks etc. But there are other times when I can do them in certain situations but I have to know all the details and I'm definitely not comfortable. My hard no is travelling on public transport alone. I can do short journeys if in a good headspace (maybe up to an hour). I drink too much to be able to do social things, and then the hangover makes me anxious for days. I start stammering and sometimes can't speak at all, or make noises that I don't mean to. I can also have uncontrollable twitches like shaking my wrists or tapping my feet up and down. Or pacing if stood up."
yes,"hard to commit to something like meeting someone and hanging out with them, and it somehow makes you even more stressed you know you have a responsibility"
yes,"i developed a mental block that whenever my mom is home i just don’t even want to interact with her out of pure embarrassment. i will starve in my room all day and sneak in the kitchen to get food when she’s in her room or i’ll wait till she’s at work to leave my room to get food or go to the grocery store or to be productive in anyway (laundry, clean kitchen etc)."
yes,i’ve recently developed severe agoraphobia and going out in public is almost impossible for me now. everything started getting a little dizzy and spinny and my legs started to buckle but i did it!
yes,4 years of her life were spent confined to this prison with me. 4 years of missed opportunities. 4 years of neglect. It’s my fault. I hate myself for not getting better sooner. I hate myself for wondering if i’ll be relieved if she passes. Relieved of the burden of being a terrible dog owner. Of her being imprisoned.
yes,"I can’t get into the car to try anymore. I’m physically unable. I’m so upset with myself, I disappoint everyone. My family, my husband. I am on medication but that only helps so much (I can go about an hour away from my home now!)"
yes,"I was filled with endless what if’s . I didn’t feel connected to my body. Or in control of my mind. Or anything . I was petrified. ... Hours later , at home, I had another panic attack. Did it suck? Yes. Did I want to call the ambulance? Yes. Did I think I was dying ? YES!! ... I did my breathing exercises . There’s a square breathing video I like a lot on YouTube. Getting out of my head is crucial during panic."
yes,Throat tightness/lump in throat and feeling the urge to breathe in as deep as possible because it feels like you don't have enough air
yes,Im brokeb down in a million pieces ... Anxiety is unbearable i feel like im dying eveytime i try to gon out comfort zone.
yes,once your agoraphobia is pretty much gone you now have to tackle social phobia
yes,I'm extremely fatigued at the end of them...By the time I arrived at my station I had this overwhelming feeling of tiredness...
yes,"I hate what agoraphobia does to you. I couldn't fucking feed myself and could hardly make it to the bathroom, but the sheer fear of leaving my apartment really had me trying to just... not seek help. I hate this fucking disorder. it's like a prison."
no,"I am so happy to finally have overcome this massive hurdle. In 2019 i started having bad panic attacks at work, quit my job, and haven't been able to hold anything down since. "
yes,"quarantine was the start of my agoraphobia getting bad... and i miss it so much. i was able to be comfortable, and it was the norm. there was no one breathing down my neck telling me i have to leave that i have to go out."
yes,"I am just amazed at my progress, I really thought all hope was lost and I could never do this. Exposure therapy works y’all."
yes,I can’t even bring myself to go therapy. I just want to scream and fucking destroy myself. I’ve been home bound for a very long time. A whole year has gone by and I’ve been looking at the same fucking 4 walls.
yes,"I have been trying to sort out an extended leave option to give me time to focus on getting better (exposure therapy, exercising/gym, dieting, resting, continued therapy, etc)."
yes,I’m so scared to have other people drive me places. I wish I could just let my boyfriend take the wheel and he take me everywhere! It would be much easier so I could relax in the car but it scares me so bad! I want to get bariatric surgery but someone else will have to drive me home! I’m so tired of living in fear.
no,I'm going to attempt to go to my parents house that is about 45 minutes away. I haven't been more than 15 mins or so from home in 4 years.
yes,"I'm tempted to go for a walk around the block tomorrow or Friday, but I'm not sure. One of my biggest fears (& likely a key contributer to my agoraphobia) is getting sick while I'm out... But there's been some health concerns lately, and I keep feeling faint - so my anxiety is fainting when I'm out, fainting in the middle of the road, fainting and hitting my head on the kerb... etc etc."
yes,i had a major panic attack in the doctors office and had to call my mom to meet me before they even told me the results. i've been severely agoraphobic for over a year now and moderately agoraphobic most my life. it feels so overwhelming thinking about the uncertain future ahead of me. i'm genuinely thinking i'd rather just not wake up tomorrow than have to deal with this?? god i'm freaking terrified.
no,"I just wanted to make this post so that people could see that it really does get better. A year ago I struggled to leave my house. In the last week I have flown from Ireland to America, I have been in planes, trains, buses, taxis, everywhere I never thought I could be again. I genuinely cried when my plane landed because I was so happy I did it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy. I still have panic attacks and I did at the airport but someone on this sub left a comment once that said 'if you can't lose the fear, do it scared' and that's the motto I have used all week. Thank you for all the support on this subreddit 💕"
yes,"I had the worst panic attack ever. I felt like my heart was literally burning and i was breaking cold sweats. But you know, anxiety meds could be your best friend in these types of scenario and i am so glad i took them."
no,"last night, i went out into the city for drinks and desserts with a friend, and today, i semi-spontaneously booked a trip across the continent to visit some other friends! i haven't made moves even half as bold as this in /years/, and i'm very proud of myself. thought i would share!"
yes,I was extremely nervous and had some ibs issues all day. I am extremely anxious and excited at the same time. My life needs some changing.. going on like this without a goal will destroy me.
yes,"I’m a 36 year old agoraphobic artist, I am so so lonely…"
yes,I have a phobia of vomiting but I know that vomiting itself isn't that bad. It's actually the feeling of panic that I'm scared of.
yes,"I get this overwhelming fear that I'm going to have a breakdown and harm myself? I find it difficult to talk about with anyone because I DON'T want to harm myself, I just fear I will one day not being able to control it?"
yes,"I just could not go outside, the overwhelming fear and anxiety made it worse. I would look for reasons not to leave, and here it is now July 2023 and I don't know if I will ever get over this."
yes,I contemplated suicide this week because I could not go out. I had a meltdown this morning... I felt the panic attack hitting me. I have severe eczema and I could feel it burning as it flared up with the panic.
yes,I could not leave my house without a support person and even then I would have panic attacks. I was always super embarrassed that others could tell I was having a panic attack which made everything worse.
yes,"I get really bad anxiety when I'm dealing with someone behind the counter, like retail etc, especially when I have to fill out a form or use my debit card....  I feel like I get the anxiety because I feel trapped or stuck"
no,"There was a bit of a heatwave and this last week has been so hard. I've shared a vlog of 2 days, 1 success and 1 failure. Just my real life experience of this week you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOTbauyfS9Y"
yes,"my brain keeps freaking me out about it. i’m so stressed to drive there, STAY there, and then eat and function and then drive home in the dark. i’ve met his mom a few times in passing, and she’s really sweet and his siblings once before; but I’m still nervous ill have a panic attack during dinner and embarrass myself by needing to leave or freaking out."
yes,"I’m scared to run errands.  I know it will be okay once it’s done, but I’m scared now."
yes,I'm not sure if there is a term for what I experience with agoraphobia... I panic. Also have a hard time being alone... I panic.
yes,"I feel like as soon as I go into a room with someone, I’m going to panic and want to leave so bad. I don’t like feeling trapped."
yes,"I have had agoraphobia since I was 18, was not diagnosed until my early 20s, currently 26 and almost 27. I am mostly still housebound"
no,Hi everyone! I have never been diagnosed with agoraphobia but I used to be so anxious to leave the house I ended up dropping out of high school and I wouldn't leave my house for months at a time. Sometimes I wouldn't even leave my room for a week or two. My dad had to bring down meals to my room to get me to eat.
yes,doing exposures on my own to overcome agoraphobia
yes,It is so painful psychologically whenever I try to force myself to go outside. I can do it but my anxiety is really bad the whole time. Sometimes I cry as soon as I'm back home and want to self harm because of how awful it was. I have issues with body dysmorphia and feel like a hideous freak when I walk out the door and like everyone is looking at me or judging.
yes,"I had made a lot of progress, but...I feel that it has become more difficult to drive. So the amount of time and distance I could tolerate decreased, and have regressed. I find that after doing a short exposure driving session that I feel zapped out of energy."
yes,I can't keep putting of getting a job until my agoraphobia is 'under control'
yes,being home bound
yes,"I have not left my house for a full year... huge fear of needles and blood... I’ve fainted from much less. I did take awhile for me to finally accept my fate and let them go through with it. I braced myself for the horrible fainting feeling to come one but it never came. I felt terrible don’t get me wrong, I was crying and clinging to my mom. But then, it was over."
yes,police still terrify me... the thought of being pulled over gives me worse anxiety than the exposure itself
yes,i always feel like people are staring at me and ‘making fun of me’. i feel like people are judging me for my looks.
yes,I was depressed. I also don’t even enjoy spending time with my family and I’d rather be alone. Yesterday’s outing was hell enough for me cus we went to a very crowded shopping spot and it rained and I had to walk miles and that was why I ended up really irritated at the end of the day because I also get overstimulated easily.
yes,"I'll be walking down the street running out of breath because there's so much happening... there's other people on the street, traffic, it could be too hot or cold, it's loud, am I walking the right speed? I could feel level-headed about simply going and doing, but my body feels differently. My heart races and I'm out of breath. ... When I get to the store it doesn't really change as I'm standing still, or meandering through. Heaven forbid someone gets too close to me. When I get home the feeling can linger for hours."
yes,I just wanna remove myself from this world. I'm scared and petrified to try a job interview I'm tryinh not to be irrational even though I know I will be irrational and will feel trapped and negative
yes,I still get anxious. Some days I can barely manage it. It's like the anxiety has lessened but it is always still there when I'm off my property. I've been in a store for over an hour but I never feel comfortable and at a certain point I almost always have a panic moment.
yes,"I have speech impediment (stammer, speech blocks) and I feel like avoiding social interactions if it's not necessary. I just fear about situation where I will complete block and wouldn't be able to explain myself. Sweating, heart pumping, short of breath. Just state of absolute misery."
yes,"I always feel nauseous in social situations where there is no (easy) way to escape. I then fear that I will throw up in front of other people, and because of this fear, I start feeling nauseous in the first place. It's a self-reinforcing cycle..."
no,"I’m 18M, last year, march 28th 13:44 i had my first major panic attack. Screaming and crying and dpdr. I was bed ridden for at least 2 months. I had everything sent to my room, i never went downstairs. What an awful time."
yes,I struggle to leave my house. I struggle to see a light at the end of the tunnel because I’m so anxious about going outside. But I hate myself for this if I can’t be happy then what’s the point of anything.
no,The last time I did this was like 4 years ago and it was only for a few items. This time i went and had a full list. I'm proud of myself today :)
yes,"I have agoraphobia, my cousins house is about 10 mins from my place. I also have POTS and my heart doesn’t do well in the heat."
yes,I’m excited. Than I’m scared. I have thoughts that I am gonna have so much fun I can do it etc and then I have thoughts that I want to back out.
yes,I can’t not make myself go. I’m dreading so much to the point where I feel sick. Each day that I get closer to the date of traveling I get more and more anxious to the point of full blown anxiety attacks. I know that when I go to the airport I’m going to have a panic attack and cry the whole way there and even after we arrive and make myself look like a fool I front of everyone.
no,"Like B group vitamins, magnesium, iron for example? Did you have deficiencies?
I'm planning on checking mine, I have already checked my iron and it was low
Just wondering if any of those deficiencies could lead to anxiety"
yes,"the dark means it’s more scary if anything happens to me while i’m out, and I also feel like a bigger burden having to call someone to come and collect me in the dark."
yes,im terrified of driving and almost every time i have done an exposure lately my car has broken down in the middle of the road. absolutely terrifying. it makes me feel sick and dizzy my whole body shakes now.
no,Can you walk around the block? Go grocery shopping? To the letterbox? What are the conditions that need to be met in order to do those things? Just looking to other people’s experience to gauge the severity of where I’m at right now. Thankyou :)
yes,"I feel so alone in the way that I can not be in the car or even driving without having the ideology that I’m trapped and can’t escape when I feel a panic attack start. It’s taking over my life... I feel nothing but panic. I used to love driving and being driven around, but now all I associate with being in a car is panic."
yes,"So in may last year, i had a really bad break up, tried to end my life, and then was in really bad burnout for 5 months where i basically just existed on the sofa barely. I tried to pull my self out and get things back on track, but i noticed i felt so much anxiety when going to uni and work, i occasionally socialise with friends but again a lot of the time i feel uncomfortable, i've been hating public transport so much to the point i've been avoding it and if i have to go somewhere using taxis. Today i am dog sitting for my sister in the past being alone in her house didnt phase me. But today i'm super uncomfortable and i just dont feel safe, i feel like i'm gonna have a panic attack."
yes,"I'm probably going to be anxious for days thinking about my appointment non-stop. 2nd, not being able to leave until it's done."
yes,it just reinforces the idea that I'm unhelpable. Whenever I see something like...I know I will never make my way to healing. I don't see myself living past 20. It's depressing to know I'll never have a 'look how far I've come' moment
yes,"I was called lazy, worthless, selfish. So much negative. I was broken. I thought I was just some lazy garbage mother for years. I have an actual disorder and that is so relieving to know that it has a name and I can now hopefully with your help, have support and see with my own eyes that I am not alone and I can do this."
yes,"my anxiety goes through the roof, and I can no longer go out."
yes,"I have agoraphobia, therapy not working, stuck, making progress. TW: suicide ideation, suicidal thoughts, SA. ... I felt I was trapped, panicked. I ran inside, wondering what the heck had happened. ... I managed to make it to the therapist I was seeing at the time, and she couldn't really understand. ... I became housebound. ... I had a blip during our therapy where I became housebound. ... I had a traumatic time over that Christmas, and it triggered something. ... I was again suddenly so scared of having panic attacks due to the sky. ... I had a suicidal plan B as a comfort. ... I feel trapped, I can't stop blaming the sky!! I can't stop feeling anxious, scared of panic attacks, and I simply can not push past that barrier. ... I feel like I am the only person in the world who has this, and I am completely unfixable. ... I'm failing as a parent, as a human being in general. And I feel there is absolutely no point in my existence at times. Last week, all I thought about was not being here. I have no purpose in life."
yes,I went on a .5 mile walk by myself with a mask on (the masks usually cause me panic attacks)
yes,Since the surgery my anxiety has gotten worse again and I have been leaving the house less and less. I was completely homebound for 2 years before 2020-2022 and I don't want to return to that. But ever since she left yesterday I have been feeling uncomfortable and abandoned. I have cried so much. I can't even go outside to get the mail. I am completely alone now.
yes,I'm down. Looking for some community.
yes,"I experienced some quite severe symptoms of agitation...I felt all those panic symptoms, but I just accepted them and sat there until it was all over...I was surprised that it went up to 190 for about 10 seconds, and then dropped to 180, 170 and so on until 150 when I got back home"
yes,"I’m desperate to be able to find meaning and contribute to my household financially, be able to express myself through fashion and self-care hobbies, and just have meaningful human contact. I can’t go back to being content with my agoraphobia and it’s killing me."
yes,"I feel like a lot of the reasons i became this way... yet i'm still stuck living this way. My world has become so small, i have no independence, it's become my norm and i don't know how to escape."
no,"I did feel very lost and disoriented, but my sister and her boyfriend helped me."
yes,"I often avoid leaving my room. I can still go to places I feel comfortable with, like my car. But often I will spend like an hour driving somewhere, just to have a panic attack in my car and just drive away instead. I've ruined multiple relationships trying to work around this anxiety, and given up many very cool opportunities. I can't begin to imagine how successful I would be as a professional musician right now if I said yes to every cool opportunity I've been given. I feel like a failure. I'm completely driven by fear, and it's become absolutely debilitating. My 'social anxiety' has been so resistant to exposure. And therapy. And medication. I feel useless. Hopeless. Like, I feel like I'd do anything to have this curse lifted, but maybe that's not true, because I can't actually get myself to do anything. Lost many people and friends I still love and miss. Ruined lots of opportunities, usually daily. My life is miserable."
yes,"I get anxious at all even just slightly anxious it immediately turns into a heart rate of 150, I’m shaky, my heart drops, I feel like I’m going to pass out, I have that doom feeling in my chest, I get nauseous, and I just feel awful."
yes,"After crying all morning and coming up with at least 1,900 excuses to cancel"
yes,"I feel shaky, floaty, almost dizzy and just sick to stomach when going outside of my home. I dread having to go outside of my household. I have a hard time going to the dentist as I have been dodging appointments. This feeling started/got worse when I had a panic attack at the dentist's office and couldn't get a grip. After that, I didn't leave my house for a long time."
yes,I noticed this tends to happen when I'm overly anxious sometimes. This makes me very anxious normally but I'd rather them feel heard. It made my drive very hard and I wanted to turn back home very badly but at a certain point I just zoned out completely and don't even remember half the drive home.
yes,"I went alone to get bread rolls, I paid in cash and my face didn’t even go red and I didn’t have to look at my phone, can’t let these things get too difficult for me I have to keep reminding myself that no one is really looking at me and lots of people go to the supermarket everyday."

yes,I wrote about my worries about driving alone to take my kids to the aquarium… I did it! I still took some meds to help but it was a great trip and I’m so glad I did it. I truly believed it was too much for me but I did beautifully!
yes,"I started being anxious about playing with all the incidents that happened to players and along with living unhealthy (smoking, drinking) it snowballed into getting panic attacks in 2021 while playing outfield and even in goal, which surfaced as rapid heartbeat even while stationary in goal, shortness of breath, feeling unstable as if Im about to faint on my feet for up to an hour after the game."
yes,I always feel like I can never put my thoughts into words effectively. I also feel terrified of posting a comment or my opinion. It's so hard to just start a conversation. I still think I sound like a fucking idiot. I hate that I'm like this.
yes,"I could barely check my mail, but yesterday, i drove for 2 hours BY MYSELF. I normally cant handle being away from home for more than 30 mins."
yes,"I have to constantly keep myself aware of my surroundings, constantly keep watch for threats and want to run away whenever someone or something unknown gets close to me. I want to stay close to my family at all times or at least know they are near enough to me that I can run back to them whenever I have trouble."
yes,"I’m afraid of elevators, planes, indoor shopping malls, basically any place that doesn’t offer a direct escape. ... Sometimes I lie and tell people I’ve gone/done basic things that I haven’t."
no,"Get up and get yourself a hot cocoa or a smoothie - you can make it, you can order it, you have to enjoy it. Please have a good day! Tomorrow is gonna be so beautiful, take a peak outside the window to know if it's raining, snowing, or sunny =)"
yes,Every time I leave or am about to leave my house I get diarrhea or a strong urge to use the bathroom. It’s so annoying. If I stay home for weeks I have no issues but the moment I have to leave home I always get stomach issues.
yes,"I get anxiety and feel extremely depressed...I physically, emotionally, and mentally just cannot get myself to leave my house...I feel dread when I think about leaving my house, even if its just to step outside to the backyard."
no,"Hello everyone! I am hosting this poll for 4 days, trying to gauge the interest and level of participation you all are comfortable with when it comes to academics posting polls, surveys, studies, etc. [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1cx87jy)"
yes,"I was at the library, like half an hour ago- when all of a sudden I got the worst derealization and depersonalization attack- I could no longer believe I was human! Everything felt so surreal, I could not make sense of anything."
yes,I felt suffocating...it felt awful...my anxiety sky high
yes,I think It would be a cool way to get to know some other agoraphobics.
yes,"I could have waited longer but the store is just across the street so it's a short 5-minute walk. Still, I'm proud. I felt like jumping out of my skin and screaming almost the whole time, but I made it. Agoraphobia sucks but today I beat it."
yes,"I have severe anxiety and suspect I have OCD due to habits and delusions I have. I recently started having panic attacks and sobbing uncontrollably when trying to go to work or leave the house, accompanied by terrible mental health and claustrophobic feelings. I want to do things but can't, and it brings me grief to cancel or miss outings."
yes,I'm worried how I will feel when I wake up. I'd imagine that waking up away from home would send me into immediate panic
no,Dms? Anyone?
yes,"i’ve begone to start having what i think are panic attacks. ... my heart rate was at 150. it went up to 180 once, and then down to 140 once. and then went right back up to 150. it was going so fast, consecutively for two hours. no couping skill would stop it. i thought i was gonna die."
yes,"I've had agoraphobia for 4 years now... I get a really ugly jealousy of everyone who seems so normal... I'll never be the girl I was 4 years ago, when this disorder stole everything from me. And that really hurts"
no,There’s a correlation apparently
yes,my anxiety was so severe that I felt I couldn’t attend the college without a stupifying concoction.
yes,today I have done exposures and everything trying out by myself!!!! And I even got hired for a job nearby just 4 kms but still I am having a setback a bad one! And you know what I need???? Just one person to assure me ki it's okay if at all there is such a need I ll ride you back home! THATS IT! THAT'S ALL I NEED TO GO AHEAD! I have therapist but I can't ask this from her......
yes,I feel like I’m gonna puke... I told them about my agoraphobia and panic attacks but I’m freaking out. I’m about to throw myself out the window I can’t handle this
yes,"I had the first panic attack. ... My heart started running a god damn marathon. My throat needed to become solid and tense. My armpits decided to leak all of my hydration into weird aluminum based stains. My stomach did a practice drill for getting dysentery. My limbs weren’t receiving any marathon blood. I was going to die. I was going crazy. ... Years following this first panic attack. I started having them more often, and then, daily. And I still have bad anxiety. Close to panic attacks. Sometimes full attacks. Agoraphobia kicked in. Lasted ~1 year home bound, 5 years up and down variants. Afraid to be alone-house bound-can’t be left alone."
yes,"i know i can't barely handle those situations because in those moments, it's just really hard to calm down...i'm just really hyperaware of stuff and i used to not be - i remember going to those places and having the time of my life. now - i fear my anxiety symptoms, the surroundings, being too far away from home, being away from my parked car, etc.."
yes,"used to have agoraphobia without knowing what it is and i beat it unknowingly for some time. Then...agoraphobia creeped back up to me worse than ever, from staying home without socialising"
yes,I still got my cardiophobia but I’m not as scared to do stuff as I was couple months ago.
yes,I was agoraphobic for three years. Never left my home for three years.
yes,"i am spending way too much money on each of my exposures... it makes me feel too awkward to leave without buying anything, so i always end up spending money"
yes,I keep thinking what if I can’t go or what if I go and ruin everyone else’s time or what if I completely just freak out and embarrass myself while there. It also scares me to think how high my heart could be and then going on a ride but I used to LOVE rides. I’ve been doing consistent exposures on my own but the feeling of needing to escape is my biggest hurdle right now and just being in traffic sends me into panic mode.
yes,I'm so sick of feeling so broken
yes,"I feel a little freer, not being near the house. At the same time I feel freedom, but at the same time I am afraid that I am not near home... when I return to home again, something like derealization begins again, but when I forcefully move far from home, then I feel I feel a little freer, although I am worried that “I won’t have time to run home” due to a panic attack or derealization that may begin."
yes,I want to wear a hood and have my neck covered and I just feel too exposed in my room... I feel this in the back of my mind when I'm on the computer that my neck and back and sides of my face are exposed
yes,"I'm truly afraid of is the possibility of running into my ex or former friends on campus. It's the idea of encountering people I fear, even though I know it's irrational. ... I'm experiencing physical symptoms like nausea, stress-induced neck pain, panic attacks, and sudden drops in blood pressure. Strangely, these symptoms only occur when I'm on campus."
yes,I have been doing exposures since 6 months and am confident a bit about myself but still this is a big step and would like some encouragement or some stories from someone who has done this!
yes,I suffered a month in pain before I found courage to schedule the first appointment.
yes,"i was always a little agoraphobic, but i could still kind of go to school or the store or see friends, but then when covid started and we were stuck indoors, i didn’t have to. at the time, i was happy about it because i finally could just stay home like id always wanted. then one day, my family wanted to go for a walk and suddenly i found myself horribly anxious while only 2 houses down the street. that was the start of me being almost completely home bound."
no,"Took the train to a park, spent time alone and took the cab to work, all by myself 💪"
yes,"I haven't been into a store since November at this point. I feel like I've tried everything that's available to me at this point. I'm at a loss. I've tried seeking help, and have been turned away by everyone now. I don't know what to do next anymore."
yes,I would be stuck like this forever without doing anything I wanted to.

yes,stuck in doors for several eyes and everyone is out living their best lives then you realise that you need to get out there too or if not you’ll be stuck like this
yes,I couldn't go to the funeral and had to listen to the service over the telephone. It was 16 years ago and I'm not much better unfortunately.
no,"I missed my grandmother's funeral and both my childhood best friend's wedding and baby shower. I felt extremely guilty about all of that. I ended up doing so bad mentally that even panicking was better than the pain I felt being locked in my room on a daily basis. I hated feeling like I was letting everyone down that I cared about, and I hated who I was and how lonely I felt. I was going to be miserable whether I was inside or outside, you know? so I swore I wouldn't let anyone else down ever again. I wanted to at least *try* to live my life again and be there for the people I loved. I wanted to experience things and be independent."
yes,"I’ve had agoraphobia for 18 years and have a really good job that I’ve struggled to maintain due to agoraphobia and panic disorder. I still have a long way to go, and I don’t take any medication so I go easy. Some days better than others"
yes,Having nothing to lose anymore
yes,ERP for my OCD
yes,I was in a deep depression for a while after that one.
yes,I got very depressed and felt like I had to do something... Somedays and weeks there’s a setback and I feel like I can’t do anything... But right now I’m in a rough patch again and feel stressed about the holidays because I don’t know how I’m supposed to make that long distance drive without panicking.
yes,thinking the world is my home and I can let myself feel at ease anywhere
no,"It’s recover or be homeless, and that’s all. WFH isn’t an option."
yes,"my world continuing to get smaller and smaller, the fear of not being able to be there for the people I love when they need me, and dying with a bunch of regrets"
yes,I had generalized panic disorder then. 2 years ago I had a health scare about my mom that triggered homebound level agoraphobia again. A few months later I met someone online and the idea of going on a date with him actually made my agoraphobia worse.
yes,"I've been agoraphobic for 10+ years, to the point of being housebound, and I've been wanting to start recovery for a while now."

yes,"I’ve had agoraphobia on varying levels of severity over the last 12 years or so. I’ve been almost completely bed bound (minus crawling to the bathroom, etc.) at my lowest points."
no,I fell in love.
no,Don't seeing it as recovery or healing. Every bodily function you experience is normal and you are normal. There is nothing wrong with you just like we don't say you need to recover from being scared of dogs.
yes,realizing how much of a burden i was on my family. realizing it would be even worse if i k*lled myself.
yes,"I have missed my FIL, Grandma, Cousin and nephews funeral. I have missed my own child's plays and graduation. it only fuels the depression of it all."
no,Your progress is awesome! May I ask how you met your boyfriend? 
yes,"I know it's scary to think about a long drive. I still struggle every time. One thing I've found that has helped me is to plan for the panic. What I mean is that I know I might panic so I build in extra time in case I want to pull over and take a break. I tell myself, so what if I panic? Those feelings can't last forever. I'm going to survive it and I'm going to do it anyway."
no,Take some time to regroup and feel comfortable again. You’ve got this.
yes,I've often wondered if I were able to have a partner or children if it would help or hinder my anxiety or panic.
yes,"my agoraphobia was pretty severe back then...I was able to focus on challenging my agoraphobia and getting better...I still had panic attacks sometimes, especially in social situations"
yes,"I went out for a walk and drove to my workplace to get a few things, and it went well. But was tough on the way there. But I still feel like there is going to be really tough."
yes,But the feelings are so tough. But I know it always will calm down after a while.
yes,I question it sometimes. I feel if I loved with my whole heart this fear/anxiety would not stop me.
yes,meeting online is how it often starts for agoraphobia sufferers
no,Aww that sucks. Try not to beat yourself up too much about it. Just try your best. None of us asked to be this way. Hopefully there will be improvement for both of us.
yes,having severe agoraphobia and being 100% home-bound for 4 months has been crazy and today... i didn't even want to leave today i had such bad anxiety but i just decided to rip it off like a bandaid.
yes,"I've relapsed in the last few weeks and spiraled really bad. I've already had a major panic attack. I'm anxious because this place is a four hour drive from home, and a lot could go wrong being here. It's massively out of my comfort zone and I don't know how to cope. The knowledge of how far I am from home, and how difficult the journey back would be if something were to go wrong, and the fact that I'm stuck here till next Friday is terrifying."
yes,"I have serious limitations when it comes to walking. ... Alone, I can't walk around the block. It's quite a strange situation, but the logic is: the car is like safe space and walking i feel 'exposed' to whatever fear I have."
yes,"I'm too scared to go into a medical clinic for care, nor could I complete school because I couldn't go in for a test... I feel very inferior and worthless compared to other people... I'm living on a very tiny plane in this world and that there is so, so much I am missing out on spending my days huddled in a tiny neighborhood... it is for me to take a short walk away from home or to sit in a vehicle."
yes,Ive been trough this many times
no,"Oh yes, this is good!"

no,That’s great!
no,I loved writing it. I’m glad you like it. 🙌🏻
no,I'm so happy you liked that line. I find it the most inspiring too! Have a great day!
no,Thank you for your kind words. I'm glad you liked it!
no,"Well, I understand that. What I meant by “on the other side, full oh happiness” is where your journey of battling with anxiety ends and you find your freedom so that will make you happy. But you can of course adapt the letter to what suits you most and your current situation. Take care!"
no,wish i could do that. but i dont really ever see having a recovery story to tell
yes,having a little bit of hope in those panic situations
yes,i dont have hope. dont see how you could have hope if you're terrified
yes,tired or hurt or numb
no,"Look, I didn't say this will work for everyone or that is a miracle technique. I just discovered it and wanted to share with people. Some techniques work for others, some don't. For example, slow breathing for me does the exact opposite of calming down. So it's okay, I understand this may not be for everyone and I hope you'll find the right techniques that work for you."
yes,i don't have hope
yes,maybe theres just something wrong with me
yes,I thought I d never be happy.  I hated my self and my life and the world.
yes,"I had the EXACT same thoughts when I was 18-19, that I wouldn't make it past 20 or that my life will completely fall apart because of the anxiety."
yes,i dont have a part that hopes. all im looking for is a painless method out at this point and then i'll be at peace.
yes,"i don't trust my body at all, i hate that im alive, i don't want it to function at all i just want a way out"
no,That book wouldn't happen to be the body keeps the score huh? Cuz that's a good one.
yes,"There's this 911 call of a little kid finding his brothers body that really helped me realize that I cared if not for myself, for the strangers that had to deal with me after.  There is no painless way out, you pass the pain on."
no,Nope. The book I’m referring to is “The Dare Response” by Barry McDonagh. A great book for anxiety
yes,I’m scared to death. I’m getting myself so worked up and I’m terrified I’m gonna panic in public.
yes,"I start to feel like I can’t escape fast enough. The heat makes me feel like I’m going to collapse and then I start to not be able to breathe, heart races, profusely sweating, and legs get weak."
no,"Hi people, I've been a member of the discord server of Agoraphobia Support Group and attending the Zoom meetings past 15 days. My discord account gave an error today so I had to start a new but I lost the link to the server. Is there anyone here who's also a member? Could you send me a link? Thanks in advance."
yes,"I feel like such a burden. I have a very difficult time going outside by myself. I’m afraid that I’m going to be hit by a car, assaulted, judged, or kidnapped. I’m absolutely convinced every day that something awful might happen between leaving home and getting to work. I simply do not feel comfortable commuting alone. I panic and she’ll feel bad and give me rides, but it’s clear that she doesn’t like it and that she’s frustrated. I’m exhausted. I don’t want to be like this anymore and I’m afraid that I’ll never be able to live or commute on my own."
yes,I've been afraid to leave the house and go out anywhere in town. I haven't been on a walk in a month. Sometimes I'm afraid to even go in the front yard. ... I got super anxious and missed a day of work. Then i just stopped going and got too afraid to leave my dorm room or go to half of campus which was by my campus job. ... I'm even avoiding my therapist. ... The self harm thoughts have started slipping back into my head.
yes,my biggest fear is passing out and having a panic attack. i’m worried i’m just gonna ruin it all.
yes,"I have anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and monophobia. But im also afraid to die. ...Im affraid anyway! Im gonna die one day, im a gonna wait for that day to happen and to panic? Probably and i hope i wont even notice it. So what if i panic, it always disappeared. So what if i die, no panic anymore."
yes,"i’m very anxious about the social aspect of it. i panic when i feel trapped in conversation with people im not comfortable with. sometimes i can literally go mute when i panic, and its so humiliating. i’m scared that might happen and then ill have to ask someone to drive me back to the airbnb which would be so rude."
yes,"I got consciously anxious after I noticed physical symptoms like dizziness, heart palpitations, dilated pupils & heavy breathing... I still feel the need to escape from restaurants etc. which developed because I had dizziness, palpitations etc."
yes,"I feel like all my friends just dropped off the face of the planet, I can’t get my best friend to actually hang out with me and she use to get so irritated I couldn’t stay in shops, I’m feeling so lonely and upset I feel like everyone has resentment"
yes,"I was super worried all week, and only slept about 2 hours. I didn't eat or drink because I get extreme IBS and cramps, so I'm incredibly tired and feel like throwing up."
no,"People are nice. Strangers hold the door for you, cashiers make pleasant small talk, neighbors say hi, etc. That’s all"
yes,I was in between hundreds of my colleagues and I didn’t panic
yes,"I’ve had 3 serious relationships in my life and all have ended because of the other person getting “fed-up” with not going out every weekend, dates being a rarity etc. I’m not ashamed about it as every partner I’ve had has seen positive growth in my agoraphobia. I was able to sleep over at my latest exes house a few times- which is something I could’ve never even imagined doing with the previous partners!"
yes,feeling terrified and depersonalized... feeling dpdr and anxious
yes,"He has panic attacks. He does not like to leave the house unless it’s something he absolutely loves to do and he’s with a friend, but he also runs out of tolerance for it very quickly. The other day we were going to go to a small aquarium and he has a major panic attack at home before he was even able to bathe or think about going. It took about an hour and 30 but after I let him lay in his bed for a bit, he was able to bathe and went out with us for a couple of hours and then to dinner."
yes,I was very specific that wfh is currently the one works best for me since I have agoraphobia... I felt bad for having agoraphobia... I just wish more REAL opportunities can be provided for people with mental health issues.
yes,lack of motivation and self discipline
no,I'm trying hard to push past my comfort zone. Baby steps hell yeah
yes,"I developed agoraphobia half a year after getting together with her and in that time she watched me struggle. She was always there for me and even helped out with exposure in the beginning. During our relationship I made large strides in my progress. I even traveled outside of the country for almost a month! However, no matter how far I progressed, or how much I did for her and our relationship it wasn't enough."
yes,I’m afraid to talk to people. I’m afraid to go anywhere other than work and I don’t even feel comfortable there. I’m afraid to get my hair cut. I’m unable to make phone calls. I don’t go to events I would enjoy. All because I don’t feel safe anywhere but on my couch.

no,"I’ve been agoraphobic for over a decade. I have been housebound on and off, I was almost completely restricted to my home for 4-5 years prior to last year. "
yes,I suffer from Agoraphobia (basically the fear of leaving my safe space… although I can leave my home I’m not very dependable and am at the mercy of my anxiety day to day).
yes,Six months ago I could barely make it to the grocery store. I’m a remote worker but today I came to the office for the first time in a long time 45 mins from home. Big win today! For any who feel they can’t I was with you six months ago. Even four months ago. 
yes,"I started feeling extremely sick (which caused a panic attack) I had to tell everyone that I needed to leave and we all went home. Ever since that it was hard for me to go to restaurants without feeling extremely sick. It just started to get progressively worse. Now I can’t really go anywhere unless i’m extremely distracted, which is hard to achieve."
no,"Within the last year I went from having nightmares (literally) about traveling down the street to now being away from home for 8-10 hours every day. This week, I also drove 1.5 hours away from my city for the first time in 5 years and met up with a friend I’ve been too scared to go out and see after 2 years of knowing them online."
yes,"I've just been crying all morning. I feel like my 13 year old self hates me so much, she wouldn't understand why I couldn't do it."
yes,I sometimes struggle a lot with self confidence and self image... I think a panic attack is pretty much the most fear inducing thing the human body can experience.

yes,I am stuck at home for about 3/4 years because of my agoraphobia. I have also gotten better at being outside when I'm with people who I feel safe around. Sometimes I wake up and I feel extremely motivated and excited by the thought of getting better but other days I could just start crying at the thought of it.
yes,"The week before I got so so scared and thought I could never do it. But I tried to be understanding with myself and didn't punish me for my anxiety, I kinda just accepted it."
yes,I feel terrible... It’s affecting every aspect of my life. When I hear them talking outside it brings fear and anxiety. I even go as far not to play my guitar in fear of someone listening. When I am in my home I’m extra quiet too.
yes,"I haven’t left my house in two years and I keep telling my boyfriend I want to try to go for a car ride and then when he offers it the day of I freak. I don’t have a full-blown panic attack where I can’t breathe I dissociate and then once I come back, I feel like I died and I panic. I don’t feel real. ... it was happening when I was by myself all the time and I was scared I was gonna crash because I almost got into a really bad wreck and now I’m just scared of being scared if that makes sense like you’re gonna panic you’re gonna be scared you know that so just push through it you’re not gonna die but nobody realizes how terrifying that feeling feeling like you’re dead and just watching over."

yes,"I get extremely nervous in certain situations that I cannot easily escape, formal dinners with a waiter, gatherings inside someone home, work meetings, movies, Costco, gym. I find myself just trying to get through situations rather than enjoy and feel like it’s a constant battle. I honestly cannot go out to eat at a restaurant I completely loose my appetite and my main symptom is sensitive gag reflex and nausea."
yes,"i am battling trauma, depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, an eating disorder, and ocd. everyday takes all my strength, and they expect me to achieve more???? i get that i am a burden. i feel so much guilt for existing to the point where its usually the reason for my SI. but i cannot just ignore my anxiety and become a functioning adult? if i could i wouldve years ago!!! i hate this!!! i hate being such a burden!!! wasting my life!!!! making my parents embarrassed!!!! but im just trying to keep myself alive!!!! i dont know!!!!!!"
yes,I feared the health issue was at its worst for having gone untreated. I was able to remain calm in the hospital for the most part... the EMT even stayed by my side during the trip and played calm waves and gave me sips of water (I was restrained for my own safety for panic).
yes,I've wasted my life and experienced almost nothing. I've never had any ambition since as long as I can remember. I just wish I was normal and not capable of isolating for this long.

yes,"I was terrified. I havent been able to do something like that, especially with strangers, basically for as long as I can remember."
yes,"I was crying in the shower last night. I cried this morning. I felt like shit on the drive out there but I took suggestions I read on this group...I had scary thoughts (I can’t do this, I need to turn around and go home)"
yes,"During the day time, I can’t go *anywhere* without panicking. I took an Ativan just to go to the g.i doctor but still was having the worst panic attack in the waiting room. Even the car ride there was pretty bad."
yes,"im crying and panicking about going out, scared people will see me, im so scared to go out its ruined my life"
yes,I wish my brain would remind me of that rather than making me feel like I'm losing my marbles
yes,"I hardly ever get real sunlight. I only go out into the daylight once every two weeks to get groceries. I always wonder if my depression is this bad because I have hardly gotten any sunlight the past two years. I was too anxious to go on my front porch and sit on our chairs out there. I was anxious, but at the same time I also enjoyed actually looking at the grass and the sky and feeling the sun on my skin."
yes,"I felt so afraid and anxious on the way there, I have driving anxiety too. ... I was sweating and my hands were shaking I felt so uncomfortable. ... my hands shook as I gave the receptionist my card. ... I almost threw up because this stressed me out so much. It makes me sad to think I've become this way, I used to be able to go places without feeling extremely anxious. It's so hard to leave my house I have to push myself really hard to go."
yes,"I started having panic attacks at 17 and since then I have developed a pretty nasty case of agoraphobia that basically locks me at home and I can go out only if there's my boyfriend or my mother with me, otherwise I feel like I'm dying."
yes,"I suffer from emetophobia and right before the test was happening it felt like my throat was closing, my heart was beating really fast, and I almost had to back out of the test."
yes,I can’t work I can’t leave bed. I can’t do much... I don’t really leave my small room or air purifier. I don’t go anywhere without getting upset.
yes,I’m back to feeling extremely anxious and trembly and it takes me a lot to walk on the street because my grandma passed away.
yes,Absolutely terrified! I haven’t flown solo in 4 years
yes,"I’ve been diagnosed with agoraphobia, PTSD, anxiety, and depression for 13 years. ... I still feel super anxious when out of the house. Constantly checking surroundings, I literally never relax. I get back home, close the door, and feel like I can finally breathe deeply. Making phone calls is still a struggle point of mine. ... I feel like I’m in a can that’s going to get crushed while I’m in it."

no,thank you! i will
yes,"I hadn't been outside in close to a month I think, so I was actually pretty proud of myself"
yes,At one point I let it run rampant but got fed up and fought tooth and nail to be free. Nowadays I can do a lot without spiraling into a panic attack.
yes,I havent worked in almost a year and find it almost impossible to leave the house for more than short increments to get supplies before locking myself back inside my apt. The world outside scares me.
no,"For those of that you that have completely healed from this disorder and prison, how long did it take for you to desensitize yourself around people in public areas where you basically become normal and not anxious anymore?"
no,Thank you I appreciate this.
no,Proud of you back!
no,"Well what's going on with ya?  Btw feel free to dm me if you ever want to talk, you know I'll be at home lol.. Have you got your teeth done yet?"

yes,dealing with agoraphobia and panic
no,i’m so proud of all of us :)
no,Of course! We all need a little encouragement and support through our journey
yes,Today is a real rough day for me
yes,Agoraphobics are reliable because you always know where we’ll be. I have to leave in an hour and a half so I’m just trying to stay strong until I can take my pills
no,Thank you! 🧡 it’s all about taking steps when we can.
no,Yes!! So very proud of everyone
no,"You got this, and you let them know your situation so they're going to treat you really well.  Once you're back home you're gonna be like hell getting there, dealing with people, that was the easy part.  I forgot if you said are doing all 4 today?"
no,Yeah it’s nerve wracking but with the support from you and this rest of this community I’ve realized I’m stronger than I think. I’m mostly nervous about being awake the whole time 😳 it’s only 3 thankfully so little bit faster than 4.
yes,"Yea, I definitely remember having mine out, but it was not painful, there is a lot of pressure."
yes,knowing I’m not alone makes it easier to deal with
no,"Well a root canal should have you halfway prepared at least for the dentist's portion of today's adventure.  Yea I know what you mean, but I was disappointed any time I try to eat bad food it just doesn't taste as good anymore or it makes me feel awful.  So I try to cook better (tasting) better (for me) food, and I crave less sweets & salty stuff, but I miss them at the same time lol."
no,Oh god that was years ago so it’s been a while. But yeah I’m just hoping the gas does wonders lol. Oh I still love some “bad” food. Good ol bk chicken fries and onion ring
no,"My favorite bad food is donuts, I feel like Homer Simpson with some donuts and these days I'm stuffed after one bavarian cream lol.  I still eat them occasionally I just don't over indulge in bad food, and I eat veg now, it has made me feel better."
no,"Holy crap was that an experience. It was over quick but dang it was, almost medieval lol. I used to be huge on donuts but these days they just feel too sweet. Although I do love a good maple bar or strawberry one. But like you I can only eat one"
yes,"I sat in my room for the 2 hours before just worrying about hanging out with them. My heartrate was really high the whole time. Even when I went to go, I felt like I couldn’t talk to them properly. My lips got really dry, my eyes water, My heart beats so fast that I forget to breath properly then when I talk it sounds like I just ran a marathon with my odd breathing."
no,"Hi everyone, I wanted to come here and share some really exciting news that would hopefully give you all hope for your own journey. Quick note: I've been housebound for over two years now. I struggled in grade 11 and 12 of High School and I am now in my fourth year of University). ..."
yes,"I was catatrophizing all morning. I gave up before even going. But then... caught my breath and going back to those little, careful steps. Just inching along. And then, before you even realize it, you've walked a mile."
yes,"Even before my agoraphobia was rough, I still never liked the movies and feeling “trapped” without a quick, seamless exit."
yes,I stopped working normal job from severe grievous fear of dealing with people anymore. I could not cope with my PTSD. I'm highly drained to the point where I can't handle it. Sometimes from depression I can barely walk let alone have a job
yes,Yesterday I went into the store for the first time in a few weeks because i needed something.
yes,"Ive been agoraphobic for the last 3 years almost 4, and I’ve had so much progress in the last two months than I’ve ever had. I don’t know what changed exactly. I was putting in as much effort back then as I was now except I’m just receiving it better I guess. For the first time yesterday, going out was simple and easy."
yes,I was having blackout-tier panic attacks over and over again and making zero progress before that despite trying my hardest
yes,When I started engaging with the new areas Ive unlocked... Repeat and repeat... show that fearful side of you that it's safe!
yes,I was moving fast and then my therapist really wanted me to start driving and o tried to trust the process but really reallllllly spiraled backwards. There was a solid 2 months that I nearly was back at square one but once I found my footing it came back a little quicker.
yes,going homebound for 4 years
no,"Getting a job in the retail/hospitality industry. It was absolute hell at first but the longer you stick at it the more comfortable you will become, especially when you get to know the people you work with. Plus the pay is a big motivation lmao"
yes,haven't dissociated and wondered how i got to the car
yes,"I’m slowly trying to reach the store with is around 5 mins from home and I walk there, hoping I can go in just to buy a drink or some flowers for someone, I can reach the edge of the car park it’s just getting to the main door and stepping in."
yes,Not everything needs to be a test of anxiety.
yes,"2 yrs ago I couldn’t leave home, now I’m able to get around 2-3 mins from home and I was able to just manage grab a prescription in the chemist"
no,"ugh, this is a dream"
no,"That’s great!! I’ve almost gone down this route! I’m making slow nephews day by day but it is slow, nevertheless I’m slowly winning"
yes,"did you find that the medicine helped fairly quickly, or did it take several weeks to feel a difference in your anxiety levels?"
no,"I love hearing these success stories, gives me so much hope!  I’m glad you’ve made so much progress in the time you have. Thankyou for sharing! 🙌🏽"
no,I’m so happy to hear your success! This is such a dream for me. Congratulations 🙌🏽
yes,You will feel so accomplished even when you go in the store even if you don’t need anything just go in and come out
yes,Sometimes if I read too many negatives from this group or outside of it it makes me spiral a little bit. For me personally it seems like a big part of any progress I make revolves around my mindset. I sometimes have to “fake it til I make it”
no,You are right!! Thankyou ☺️
yes,"been struggling with panic disorder and agoraphobia for a while, it has improved a lot but im feeling weird"
yes,"I feel so lost. I don’t feel in fight or flight anymore and the last three days for the first time ever when I wake up I feel relaxed and not in a panic. But I can’t even go out in my garden or on a walk, no chance of going back to work. I’m not having racing thoughts anymore and if I do I can control them, it’s more of the panic feeling (edge of a panic attack) even thinking about going out."
yes,"I was able to leave the house today, and join my sister to walk the dog. The first couple of minutes were tense, and I almost turned back to go home, but I forced myself to stay with my sister."
yes,"I feel frightened all of the time. Most days I am too afraid to even leave the bedroom. I've tried sitting in the living room, sometimes I can do it for an hour and other times I have to shut the living room door when I'm in the bedroom because I'm so afraid of it (I feel like I've gone crazy). I've been struggling with my mental health for a long time... I'm losing motivation for things to get better because I hate where I live and I'm lonely and isolated."
yes,I barely leave my apartment anymore. I slipped and fell on wet stairs 6 months ago and messed my shoulder up pretty bad... I already have difficulties due to experiences I’ve had in the past over not being taking seriously/believed.
yes,"Hard to swallow anything, even if im not eating or drinking anything. Very very dry throat. Hard breathing ( maybe im imagining that )"
no,:))
yes,I've struggled with intense anxiety about it for a long time
yes,I've had an awful abscess for 3 days and finally said screw it. Walked myself down to the hospital.
yes,I’m so embarrassed by my appearance I wish I could be beautiful
yes,I've lived alone since my late teens. Isolated a lot... I didn't mind at all not leaving for weeks. ... I can't stand being alone now and I feel this urge to go outside but basically... I can't do it. ... I feel angry at myself. I feel sad for myself. I feel weak and a lost cause. ... I didn't feel like a prisoner before. Now I do. ... I am an utter failure. It's sunny outside. I'm frozen with anxiety looking at the window seeing people walking around without a care in the world...
yes,"I lost myself because i was still very much in love with her even when we stopped talking and I've never had the chance to tell her my feelings, I felt that there was no point continuing living, the past 9 months I have been at home gaming and sleeping and waking up at irregular hours, I feel like shit everyday, I quit my job after hearing the news of her and my mental health took a toll on me, I have been living off my savings and now I am short of money, I want to get a part-time job but I'm scared of meeting new people and having to travel to work, I am okay with going out as I do not have social anxiety but the thought of having to get ready and dress up all nice to go out of my house drains me, I have counselling soon but even the thought of going there alone makes me scared and I don't know what to do about it"
yes,"I have a few beers every night to calm me down because battling this along with OCD, and depression has just been way too much for me...I can’t get my dopamine from going out and doing normal things so I have to get it somewhere right? But without alcohol I don’t leave the house. It completely numbs my fear to the point where I can do anything. It literally blocks a panic attack from happening."
yes,Going to the store was always hard at the worse of my agoraphobia
yes,"I get really anxious my chest hurts,I get headaches I feel like I can't take a full deep breath and I can't really function so i stay in bed all day.I also can't sleep and eat.As soon as I enter my dentist office I my heart beats really fast my feet tingle, my chest hurts,I feel like I can't take a full breath and I just want leave right away.The last time I west to the dentist I had a new symptom numb hands. It made me feel more anxious than ever.Recently I broke a bracket of my braces and just thinking that I have to go back it feels like I can't breathe,I can't stay still,I keep crying my chest hurts.I'm currently panicking."
yes,"I developed agoraphobia about a year ago after something traumatic happened to me causing ptsd. I’d have panic attacks and they were worse when I would leave my house, especially in big crowds or areas where there were men I didn’t know around. ... It’s just gotten worse and worse overtime. I feel like such a burden and sometimes I can tell my family is a bit resentful of me. ... I just feel like it’s really upset me because I already felt like I am taking advantage of my families kindness and now it feels like he’s kinda confirmed that. ... I don’t want to keep asking them because then I’m making everyone’s lives difficult. It’s so hard not to feel like a waste of space and like they’d be better off without me. I just don’t know what I’m going to do. I want to get better but it’s so easy to not even try when you feel like you cant do things and logically I know I’m my head o have no reason to be stressed about going to the shops on my own but it feels impossible. I hate feeling this way and I really don’t see a way out."
yes,I get panicky and anxiety...I had to go to the ER today and caught an Uber and then had to go and pick up meds...I was fine. I have GAD and panic disorder...that has impacted me
yes,I've suffered from agoraphobia for 12 years. I'm afraid to leave the house or go certain places like safe zones.
yes,I was so nervous about getting into a car (I’ve been house bound for almost a decade)
yes,"I avoid at all costs leaving the house. Only leaving to go to work once or twice a week depending on the requests. Everytime I go out, I feel severe anxiety and panic, especially when public. Although being fully aware that people couldn’t care less, I still feel judged, inadequate, and weird in a crowd. Sometimes I think that I have a good relationship with people at work, but my anxiety keeps telling me they are thinking horrible things about me. It’s been difficult. Being in public is incredibly challenging and stressful to me."
yes,I’m in a position where I can’t drive more than 25min outside of my comfort zone/“safe” areas. Furthest I’ve been in 7 years was a 3hr assisted road trip that took months of planning just to attend a family wedding.
yes,I cant drive without having a full blown dizzy spell/panic. I drove to the dentist last week and legit almost passed out and had to pull over.
yes,I’m just locked in my bedroom on screens all day because nothing else distracts me from this mental torture
no,"I just want to share, that after 2 months of constant exposure therapy and zoloft, my life has changed. Just weeks ago, I broke down in front of my roommate because I genuinely didn't think I was ever going to leave the apartment again, but today I went and played squash at the gym with a friend, and gave another friend a haircut. I've still got a ways to go; for example, I made it to a job interview last week, but I can't fathom actually working. But it's still been a massive transformation. Exposure therapy could be one of the hardest things you ever do, but you might as well get started now. It's empowering to see progress, even though sometimes it feels silly to celebrate things that a healthy person doesn't even have to think about."
yes,I haven’t left my house in months... I drove to the party today! I went and stayed for around 3.5 hours... I was feeling very drained but very accomplished.
yes,I literally feel like I'm gonna suffocate and need to jump out of the car.
yes,I am so nervous because I will be mostly alone. Both of my parents have passed away..
yes,"Due to meds I cannot drive and I have pretty bad agoraphobia, anxiety, panic disorder and intrusive thoughts. The intrusive thoughts specifically about jumping out of the car on the freeway."
yes,3 months ago I thought i’d never even make it out the front door. I’m so happy.
yes,I feel like I’m going to pass out or I over analyze every beat of my heart and feel like once of those palpitations is going to be the last beat I ever feel
yes,i have no energy ever. i never even get bored because i am okay with sitting in silence and not moving. im always exhausted and fatigued and it makes me not wanna leave
yes,Responses saying this person likely with agoraphobia is manipulative and doesn’t care because they cannot leave their home.
yes,"I'm scared that I'll feel panic in that place but I'm also scared that people will notice me panic and judge me, think I'm weird or insane."
yes,I have chronic illnesses and don't stay at home on purpose or to upset anyone... it's like they think I'm just crazy.
yes,"I have really felt giving up on life. I have been fainting, I'm broke, ... feeling weak and powerless"
yes,"My issue with leaving my house is more the fear of something traumatic happening while outside. Not being able to pay attention to potential dangers while in busy environments and generally feeling extremely unsafe. Everytime I leave the house I get overwhelmed with extreme anxiety, heart palps, sweats, flushing and many other inner and outer freaking out stimuli."
yes,"I was afraid of being judged by the people outside, afraid of social situations and the outcome of conversations. I have discovered that I likely have social anxiety"
yes,I felt like I was peaking with my symptoms before this because the day before even sitting near the window or balcony gave me panic attacks. Now I'm locked back in my room. The anxiety is crawling back.
yes,"i just dont care. I hate having to do everything on my own, i have no one to rely on so its easier to just starve myself so i dont have to go outside."
yes,I get so anxious when I'm with other people. I hate going out with people that aren't my family or meeting up with new people due to the act I'm scared to panic and lose control. The thoughts are about yelling things for no reason or losing control of myself when anxious/ panicking.
yes,"I just can’t leave my room. I’ve gone through some stuff recently and my anxiety is just out of control. I feel so alone. I seriously just plan on wasting away in here, I’m super obese so I can do it."
yes,Ever since June of 2023 until now I haven’t been able to get out of the house. It’s very rare that I leave and when I do it’s catastrophic.
yes,"It led me into huge depression, social anxiety, school fear, agoraphobia, and general anxiety with ptsd symptoms."
yes,"I fear panic attacks, I get hyper aware of my breathing once I feel nervous and I’ll start hyperventilating. I don’t meet my friends anymore cuz I cannot travel by public transport alone. I feel like a burden if I want to go somewhere my mum needs to accompany me or my dad needs to drive me... I feel like a burden. I feel like a loser being a dependent person. I don’t go out and I missed out a lot of things because I can’t tell my friend I can’t travel."
yes,"I can’t even think about leaving my house without getting vertigo, hyperventilating, having a panic attack and feeling like I’m dying… now the anxiety is being worsened even more because I have multiple health issues… I seriously need to see doctors, but I couldn’t even go to the ER if I was actually dying because of my agoraphobia."
yes,Make excuses for anything that doesn’t have an easy exit? Wondering if hiding it makes it 100 x worse
yes,"I can go out for maybe 15 minutes at a time, ...pass the time and not have to think. Sometimes I’ll draw. But I’m getting older and I had so many dreams..."
yes,"I wanna cut my stomach out of my body wtf is wrong with it, like work properly smh."
yes,"turning the most basic of tasks into terrifying challenges, and yet this condition is hardly talked about"
yes,"i didn't want to make the effort to go, i just didn't want to so i've been completely sabotaging myself for the last few weeks, turning into a stressed out mode almost on purpose and never being positive. i thought i would rather hurt myself than go"
yes,"I'm a 45 year old man, on disability, because I can barely leave my house… I fought… and failed perpetually… and finally made my peace with it. That is the absolute worst thing about agoraphobia… for me."
yes,i dont even know what commitment is anymore... or a routine
yes,"My anxiety has gotten so bad I haven’t been able to go back to my parents to spend time with my dad on hospice, couldn’t even go outside!"
yes,"I'm wondering if I should start going for 1 hours or 2 hours just being out of the house, not necessarily that full time in a high anxiety area, maybe the nearby park."
no,Work
yes,"I’m terrified of leaving the house incase I start to feel nauseous while I’m out, and also the fear of being exposed to a stomach virus or similar."
yes,"I have severe agoraphobia. I am housebound, not able to work. I struggle with panic disorder, agoraphobia and a LOT of intrusive thoughts. My BIGGEST instrusive thought is to just jump out of the car whilst he is driving on the freeway."
yes,I still did it A LONE! And I didn’t cry when the store was unexpectedly crowded or when the cashier had to fiddle with the items so they would scan. It was emotionally exhausting
yes,i always feel extra anxious when i'm wearing a bra... i think it's actual anxiety but idk why this would happen
yes,"Sitting in your house isn’t gonna fix things, a therapist isn’t gonna fix things, the only person that can fix you is you. Go out, try it. Don’t give up, ofcourse it’s hard. But start somewhere, don’t let this anxiety make you housebound forever."
yes,I’m her emotional whooping boy
no,I felt this way. Stuck with my ex. In a house alone. Scared and lonely. And then I got pissed. He was an absolute asshole. I needed to leave to get better but it felt impossible. I needed help.
yes,Always end up having a breakdown eventually and it’s a bitter cycle...I can’t live anywhere else and feel at peace...I’m 27 now. The older I get the more I feel just…yuck about still living with them
no,"Every success story from this starts with a mind set change, push yourself to go outside your comfort zone. Each small step counts"
yes,I hardly know how I’ll get through. It’s mortifying.
no,[deleted]
yes,feeling real uncomfortable
yes,Being stuck like this makes it impossible for me to think about the future without panicking and spiraling.
no,Take your meds. Drink water. Get lots of sleep. Do what's up front of you. One day at a time.
yes,The hardest part is the beginning due to the big mental block
no,Yep and it sucks
yes,Agorophobia
no,Does therapy without medication works ?
no,U struggle the same?
no,"no offense, but i’m not sure if keeping your kids homeschooled is going to help them, you might be encouraging them to mirror your behavior."
yes,Been homebound (again) for over a year. Was 2 years before. Then beat it for three years. Now with my dads death and my divorce I’m back to stuck.
no,Im so sorry u went through all that especially divorce its not easy... may I ask if you are on some disability?
no,Im not but I’m going to start trying. I heard it’s a complete pain especially in the us.
yes,not enough awarness on mental ilness
no,It took me 4yrs with a lawyer.
yes,"My partner is struggling to manage her depression. She has a lot of environmental and physiological elements stacked against her, not all of which we can control (family history, gender dysphoria, recent move/life changes, autism). She's in a bad place and we need to take further steps. She's bordering on agoraphobia so much that her therapist is trying to intervene and encourage her before it gets much worse, but it's bad enough that she can't go outside/public spaces without help and the therapist says she may need a specialist soon. She's going to discuss her suicidal thoughts with them during their next visit."
yes,Have only been out for Dr appointments in the last several months. At that point I was starting to panic and wanted to just go straight to my car but I didn’t! I finished shopping.
yes,"it was taking me every ounce of strength i had not to end my life way before coronavirus dropped. i've spent probably 80% of my time isolated at home in-front of a screen for the past 7 years, so this excess confinement is really driving me nuts. i don't know how much longer i can manage."
yes,"I’ve been dealing with suddenly becoming agoraphobic and having severe panic disorder since April. I’ve had full blown panic attacks every single time, including several small rebound ones. This is really really hard and I’m feeling super discouraged."
no," Went to my nans for dinner, i was really apprehensive and wasnt gonna go as last time i went i had a panic attack, but i went and it went perfectly fine, and the best bit was i decided to walk back by myself, i had my foot in the car and i just decided to take the harder route and walk back and challenge my walking anxiety, the walk went fine and it felt great, my longest walk in ages, gives me alot of confidence going against the easy route and going against my anxiety."
yes,I can pretty much guarantee that I’ll feel like total crap with extra anxiety and sometimes low mood. It makes exposures that much harder.
yes,I have diagnosed general anxiety and panic disorder with agoraphobia in the mix. I'm pretty nervous about this journey
no,came across this quote by georgia o’keaffe this morning and thought perhaps somebody else here needed to hear it too. i write this ahead of a busy holiday out and about with my family; wish me luck :(
yes,"I’ve had Agoraphobia since I was 13, so it’s nice to see some progress. Especially since I have four other anxiety disorders top of it!"
yes,I can’t take this anymore I’m so depressed and so alone. I just want to die I already took an overdose last week I just wish it had killed me I can’t go on like this.
no,"If you are struggling with panic disorder, anxiety and agoraphobia, you absolutely need these books in your life (Hope and Help to Heal Your Nerves by Dr Claire Weeks and The Anxious Truth by Drew Linsalata). Every symptom, thought and feeling I have had around my anxiety has been validated and helped massively by these two lovely people. They have made the past 6 months of my life a lot easier. I’m still on the journey, but this mindset has made a big difference to me! Drew also had a podcast called The Anxious Truth which is incredible, and you can digest them in little 10 minute eps which I love. It gets easier when you put the work in, I promise you can do it too 💕"
yes,"I completely freaked out walking to the car. I even had to take one of my rescue anxiety medications which I haven’t had to take recently. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared when people even come visit to the house. I’m feeling like life is passing me by. For the first time in my life I’m actually very worried how hard I have to fight for my life at such a young age. I’m ashamed to admit this but at the moment I feel hopeless, I don’t know how I let myself get to this point in my life. I’m having a hard time picturing not being like this."
yes,"I can't leave unless I'm with my husband, and even then, it's difficult. I get scared walking on my own, even in a store if I can't see him. ... I get nauseous. ... I get too close to the windows and I get nauseous. ... I can hear the traffic makes me twitch. ... I'm literally **VIBRATING** like a freaking chihuahua. ... I'm standing behind my front door, because going outside makes me feel **SO** sick. So nauseous. Like my lungs are on fire and I can't get enough air."
yes,Screw you agoraphobia!!!
yes,I have agoraphobia...be patient and kind with her. Try to be as understanding as possible and encourage her.
no,awesome thank you and good luck with everything
yes,I don’t want my anxiety or panic to ruin it
yes,I'm terrified of opening up and showing to people my weaknesses. I'm scared to be judged as mentally unstable and to be pitted upon.
yes,"I’ve been unemployed for 5 months which made my agoraphobia worse. I literally have gone 1 mile away in the past 5 months... I feel so depersonalized and out of it while in a car and feel like every single red light is never going to turn green, and so trapped in the car... Idk if that makes sense, but i will get anxious sometimes because i feel like it’s abnormal that im not feeling anxious. If im not constantly checking to see if the anxiety is there, i force myself to be anxious."
yes,"I felt so anxious at the store, like i was a burden for being in way or something. Couldnt hear the cashier so I asked her to repeat a few times which was humiliating to me... I cant just walk around the city alone, i get so scared i always think people want to hurt me or rob me or beat me up. I have ptsd from getting car jacked once and some other stuff has happened but ive never gotten beat up before in the street. I cant stop the panicking please help."
yes,Shrinks our world to nothing.
yes,Maybe there is something the matter with me...I've got everything...But who cares? No big deal I want more...Wish I could be part of that world
yes,I developed agoraphobia at 17 years old. I would stay in my home for months. But slowly things are improving. The thought of me trying to apply sends me into a panic. I feel like a child sometimes. I just don’t know what I am supposed to do. I feel like such a failure. I just am overwhelmed with anxiety about my future.
no,"Hi again, Happy Sunday to all. I felt inspired to write this for you. For anyone who doesn't know me yet. I am a 37 year old PD and Agoraphobia survivor. I say survivor because essentially I can say with confidence that I overcame Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and now live what I consider to be a normal life enjoying all the things I used to before I was diagnosed with the disorder. ..."
yes,"was super anxious, didn’t sleep, vision was blurry and felt faint"
yes,I'm tired of trying... I mean I can't just be happy for her right here in the kitchen ffs. Make me feel bad and like I don't care about anyone but myself.
yes,I don’t feel anxious or scared
yes,I was feeling extremely dissociated and suffocated. Air 'hunger' is my main panic symptom.
yes,I was having panic attacks the whole time trouble breathing thought I was going to die
no,"My anxiety has gotten a lot better over the past year or two. I still don’t go out that often, but when I do go somewhere, I feel pretty calm and don’t get all shaky/feel sick like I used to. But as soon as I get home, I’m exhausted! I usually end up spending the rest of the day lazing around because I feel completely drained, even if I didn’t feel that anxious while I was out. Does anyone else get like this?"
yes,"I don't work, haven't been able to work for two years because of severe mental health issues. I have severe depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, and social anxiety."
no,What do you do for living?
yes,"I developed Agoraphobia about 20 years ago. My husband completly unexpectedly left after a twenty year marriage, all adult relatives in my small family died, and one of my children devoloped a life threatening condition. I was left alone to raise my three kids. I have seen a psychiatrist for about 18 years now. It got to the point that the only time I left the house was for court or to take kids to doctors appointments. I put on a happy face for the kids. I have been in a rental apartment for 6 years now. I'm all alone, which I have been, but soon without a place to live. I geel so sad for the happy me I planned for as a child."
yes,"I can't renew my Id card, I can't pay for maintenance cause I have social anxiety, I'm suicidal at this point constantly crying, I'm panicking."
yes,was scary but I eased my fear with listening to music while shopping
yes,"i struggle eating as is at home, i can’t eat out and i only eat safe foods. so those things are stressing me out too"
yes,"I’ve been house bound for about 4 years, my health took a decline in early 2020 and along with that came the agoraphobia. I don’t work and I can’t really do much else. Today I had to go pick up my sister from all the way across town otherwise she would’ve been stranded. I felt so nauseas the entire time and it got so much worse when I got back. I instantly crashed, it was like my body was in shock"
yes,"I've been avoiding certain places for around 15 years now and my agoraphobia has been through some ups and downs. This week I had the dentist, so spent 7 days feeling low and anxious about it - I find the build up is the worst part! I eat extremely plain so I don't become ill before my outing, and I don't find things fun and stay in anxious mode."
yes,Sometimes it's really difficult for me to get outside of my house and it gets really hard when I have to get on public transport. I tend to have panic attacks and now in summer time it gets worse somehow.
yes,"I prefer night over day and I think it’s because of my agoraphobia. During daytime tho, I just feel so sad and bad that I can’t really leave my house."
yes,I had so many sleepless nights. So many panic attacks on the day of the concert.
yes,I'm finding myself bored and alone watching movies or series all day. I don't have friends or a boyfriend.
yes,i started dealing with agoraphobia a little over a year ago. being in the car and driving has been my biggest trigger since day one. but i can’t stop replaying it in my head and laughing?? it scares me to think about it. i keep replaying the impact and the ringing in my ears. and it all just seems so fake.
yes,After four months of not going outside I went for a walk outside for ten minutes at midnight tonight. I’ve gained a lot of weight so walking is uncomfortable at this point which is really embarrassing but the only way out is forward. My agoraphobia was triggered by an acute episode of mental illness last summer and the weight gain followed from that.
yes,"I had a traumatic event in late January that slowly started causing me random panic attacks. I then began associating these panic attacks with certain things, places, and events. ... I have been out of work as my job has cut hours, and I haven’t had much to do, then experienced a bad panic attack while driving so it’s caused me to fully cave into the fear of being away from home..."
yes,"I have had severe panic attacks my entire life and one 3 month bout of agoraphobia... For the past 3 years my anxiety and agoraphobia has been horrible. I've also developed severe depression and PTSD and go weeks without leaving my house... I get really bad food anxiety... I've been so stressed out about this trip... I just get so sick of fighting sometimes. Even though I've always had anxiety, I miss my old self... Some days I feel so sad and want to be that girl again."
no,i recorded a vlog https://youtu.be/un6CAT76sjM
yes,I have since spontaneously gotten ill. My head is dizzy and dull and my stomach is acting up. I'm paralysed with fear
no,Is there a group on discord someone can post the link to? I used the search but the links I've found have all been expired.
yes,i feel like ill never get better. i just keep thinking about how different life would be if i didn’t feel this way. im so tired. i just wanna be normal.
yes,"I was paralyzed with fear. And it got me thinking: there's actually been a lot of times, even independently of covid, where I've had difficulty leaving the house due to anxiety. * My anxiety is often worse at the office than home, because I don't get a say in if I can leave or not. * Even though I love live music and shows, I have a really hard time traveling the hour to the nearest big city for them, because what if I need to leave? I get recurrent migraines and hate the idea of being stuck in the city with a migraine or ruining everyone's fun. * I hate planes, elevators, MRI machines, crowds, and anywhere else I can get stuck physically. I absolutely hate loud bars and restaurants. * I always need to know where the exits are when I'm somewhere."
yes,I don’t think we would be magically cured. I think this kind of notion of people just getting better without having to actually work for it isn’t the best representation of living with this.
yes,I drove on a highway and a bridge without even having a panic attack.
yes,I sit here in the grocery store parking lot.  How long will it take me to get out of the car?  How many skills do I need to even get thru the door?  I hate this.  I hate how much this disease has stolen from my life.
yes,Panic attacks and anxiety are no joke...
yes,"I'm only 20 and have a difficult time imagining the future, but this kind of showed me that it isn't true."
yes,"I was housebound for around 11 years...it was like a world I forgot about because of how long I was in my room...it took 4 more years after that until I started voluntarily going out and doing exposure therapy, like 'walk to this store'...In about 1 year my exposure therapy has changed from walking to stores 10 minutes away and walking on the other side of the sidewalk to taking the bus/ subway to a city an hour away."
yes,"I got out a bus stop earlier than i mostly do cause i felt a panic attack coming, fucking shittttt. ... i felt like i was gonna pass out, and i had to be a lil bartender for a hour which made my insecure introvert very anxious."
no,Yesterday I got my first vaccination !! It was hard but I did it and I'm so proud of myself
yes,I'm literally scared of even completing a full 8 hour shift of work or to just drive down a couple of miles from my house. People with the most deadliest diseases or cancers aren’t even like this. I’m literally a normal person who just happens to be fucking scared.
yes,my heartbeat suddenly increased and I was about to start shaking....I feel like I'll fall down or something idk but I feel panic...I feel panic and can't escape and have to stay there.
yes,I have panic attacks whenever I leave but I know I’m getting worse by staying inside. I slowly have progressively got worse and I’m sooo tired of it.
yes,I feel constant anxiety and a chill creeping through me before a panic attack...
yes,"I take propranolol before some social situations, before dentist, sometimes before chiropractor, basically before anything that could give me bad anticipatory anxiety and anxiety... I tremble and shake and have fast heart rate and get dizzy. Classic panic attack symptoms."
yes,"I've been in a state of constant panic for 24 hours now, I can't eat more than a small snack. ... Every single person I walked past felt like a threat. Now I'm exhausted, and just as panicked. I feel so fucking trapped and scared."
yes,Being uncomfortable and panicking are very intertwined with me... Causing me to spiral into a panic attack. Ending at the hospital ER or worse 'death from a heart attack'... That feeling of 150-160+ heart rate while sitting still. Arms tingling. Unable to breath. Is terrifying.
yes,"i suffer from depersonalisation, and last week i had a massive depersonalisation panic attack whilst out in public. my brain has now associated the outside world with panic attacks, and now every time i leave the house- i get panic attacks."
yes,"So I spend all the time in my room currently due to agoraphobia. I have had poor posture for a very long time. I currently live in a hostel too, so am literally just in my room all the time sat/laid on my bed. I find myself slouching a lot but it’s the only place I can sit. I am slouched even as I type this."
no,"hey guys, an ex-agoraphobic here.
Im here just to say that you can do it. I had 4 shitty years with fear but life is (almost) normal now.
Somedays are harder than others but now i can do things for my family, and most special, for myself. Not gonna lie, exposure therapy was a wild process but perseverance made it possible for me to achieve good results, starting with walking my pet until I was able to make a two-hour trip to visit my grandmother.
I admit that coming out of agoraphobia was my most emotionally and wildest year of life but I admit that the payoff was worth it.
(btw srry if i sound vague but english is not my first language)"
yes,I suffer a lot from bathroom anxiety when I know I can’t easily access a bathroom I feel like I need to go really bad at all times.
yes,"I struggle taking out trash, getting the mail, even opening my door. I also have bipolar one disorder and body image/food issues, self hate, trust and other issues. Most the time I just feel pathetic and wonder why I'm alive. I'm scared that things will never get better, that I will always be alone. Most of all, I'm terrified of what I will do."
yes,"I overdosed the other day on some left over mirtazapine I had, and had to go to hospital...I am so fucking alone and depressed, now even more so. I have no hope and just want to attempt again, nobody listens and they don’t care...I can’t think of another way out at this point"
no,"I posted before that I couldn’t keep a job and was frustrated with myself. Well, I found a job and I actually like it. And it doesn’t make me want to panic. This next week will be one month with this job, and that is a huge milestone for me! Just wanted to share my accomplishment. Hopefully this can encourage others who struggle like I do."
yes,"I'm afraid of not being able to go to the bathroom when on public transport and car rides that are decently long... I feel that same urgency but when I reach a bathroom, nothing happens. It's been an issue I've had for years... I panic and start to feel really hot and out of breath when I think about not being able to use the bathroom"
yes,"I’m worried about the heat, scared of passing out, having a panic attack, there’s a lot of people, crowded, loud"
yes,"I went to the bank, stopped by the store and am now sitting at my favorite restaurant, all while driving in rush hour traffic all alone. NO KLONOPIN and NO LIQUID COURAGE and NO CALLING SUPPORT PERSON"
no,"Would anyone would like to join recovery chat (I could create one) to daily support each other on the road to recovery? I mean, not to just sit and hang around, but to truly do the hard work and help each other move, everyday. I’m myself on the journey, which is not easy, but I have a big determination to recover from my agoraphobic life."
yes,"I still feel like I can’t do it. Once I get anxious it’s so hard to make myself just leave and it get it over with, I’ll spend hours googling anxiety coping mechanisms and paying too much attention to my physical anxiety symptoms."
yes,I’m so emotional now
yes,"I get my haircuts at home, etc. I get this way with friends on FaceTime. I need to work on my agoraphobia w a therapist but can’t seem to stay on telehealth calls without having a huge panic attack and then having to end early."
yes,Why do I feel dumb 😕
yes,"so my agoraphobia has been progressing for a good while now and has been the worst ever the past few months. today i drove to the gas station and had my boyfriend go in first and decided today was not the day, but i wanted to do something, so we went to get ice cream right across from the gas station... then i felt pretty good and decided a quick gas station trip would be okay, just one item and leave. we got in there and went browsing around, ended up getting sandwiches and some snacks, definitely spent about 10 minutes in there and was fine! very accomplished!"
yes,I feel so stuck and I just don't know what to do anymore. It's so hard dealing with such severe anxiety because then it turns into depression over how badly it affects me. I have things I have to do but i'd rather face the repercussions of not doing them than do whats good for me. I wouldn't even go to the doctor 2 weeks ago when I was very obviously sick because I was too scared.
yes,I couldn't drive the closest store from my house and that store is 3 minutes away from my house. I’ve came a long way but I didn’t realize this until I just wrote down these achievements.
yes,"The text describes various behaviors associated with Agoraphobia, such as avoiding certain situations or places, feeling anxious or panicked in enclosed or unfamiliar environments, and having intense fear of being trapped or unable to escape."
yes,i was looking into trying to get a service dog to help deal with my agoraphobia
yes,"I struggle to go outside without getting panic attacks. I've spent so much of my time not being able to go outside, not being able to be a functional human being. There was a point in my late 20s, when I didn't go outside a single time. I feel like an absolute objective failure of life. I can't hold on a job, or reliably got outside, and I still struggled to speak to people."
no,Make sure she sees a doctor and a therapist. Call her as much as you can. Don’t forget her. See her if you can visit her. Don’t pressure her to visit you:)
no,"Maybe you can give her support for going out by being on the phone with her while she does it. Many people find it easier to go out when a trusted person is with them, and I would think that being on the phone would be similar."
yes,talking to her while she goes on a short walk will comfort her and u can reassure her how well she is doing
no,Those are helpful tips thank you! I will keep this in mind. :)
no,I will try that! We don't normally call each other but maybe I'll start and see if that will help her. :)
no,That's a good idea. We don't normally do that but maybe I'll start calling her so we can! Never thought of that.
no,Does anyone know what kind of jobs you can 10000% do from home and still make a living? I live in Europe
yes,"I dithered all day about whether I could go inside the store alone, but I finally did it! I actually went into two stores, in a row, by myself!!! Feeling pretty great about it, and although I was very anxious the entire time, it went smoothly, and I feel like I could do it again."
yes,I havent been able to work since 2019 and I am terrified for what lies ahead. My therapist amd new psych dr are getting me a case manager to find housin but it may be a boarding house where I have to share a kitchen and bathroom with other people. I wish my cousin understood what agoraphobia is like so she'd understand that just working isn't an option while being a prisoner to one room if my aunts house i feel semi ok in.
yes,I'm so anxious that makes me even more nervous.
yes,I somehow barely felt anxious
yes,"I took the bus to therapy yesterday, for the first time in 4 years. It was 8/10 hard - it was difficult. But I did it! And I’m starting to learn the first time is almost always the hardest so hopefully next time will be easier! "
yes,"My agoraphobia comes from two major places: being yelled at, and being shot. Nearly every time I leave the house, I *am* actually yelled at... It's getting harder and harder to leave the house, because everything I'm scared of has happened and continues to happen."
yes,"I am getting bad again. I feel safe right now only in one corner of my bed, not even the whole damn bed. Just one corner."
yes,feel like pure hell with the horrible combo of negative thoughts & physical symptoms
yes,I'm scared I might break down under the pressure or relapse. I quit after panic attacks/uncontrollable crying at or before work.
yes,"Terrified to leave especially when it means going into a social setting... I was dx with agoraphobia and I do have social anxiety as well. ...having guests! Visitors of almost all types! Family, friends, professionals, etc…. I hate guests more than going out. The very thought of an upcoming visit gives me a full on panic attack."
yes,"i just recently got diagnosed with agoraphobia and just thinking about going to the grocery store gives me terrible anxiety. i don't think i can do it, being in spaces like that really freaks me out. i'm also autistic and my anxiety is just terrible."
yes,I was already having extreme anxiety... The isolation was about at its max. I couldn't do anything anymore. I was a disaster. So the thought of going to the supermarket has terrified me for years.
yes,"i feel very disconnected and when i think back about it, i feel as if it didn’t happen, or i’d be present but i start crying after i get home and start feeling very melancholic (maybe) about it for no reason? I also used to feel very trapped inside everytime i’d go into a shop or any place that was closed and that went on for 2.5 months but it went away."
yes,"I have a hard time eating out in restaurants, I think I might get sick of the food I order bc I don't have control over how it is prepared. Ultimately, I started avoiding going out to eat bc I had gotten sick a few times and wanted to avoid that."
yes,"I’ve been homebound for about 4 years now. I only left the house once... I panic instantly. The worst are the physical symptoms. I get sick, dizzy and lightheaded. Every time. I feel like I died 4 years ago and now the only thing I do is existing. I don’t have any hope left... I want to go outside, travel, meet friends, sit in the park, go for walks. But even if I force myself to go outside it’s never rewarding because it’s impossible to enjoy something when you suffer a lot of physical symptoms."
yes,"I'm agoraphobic since 14yrs old...can't leave my house *at all.* Not even to grab mail...Even leaving my room and getting out of bed is hard for me...I dropped out of high school when I was 16 because of agoraphobia...I'm unemployed, so I can't even take care of myself financially...I have no social life...I'm tired of living in fear."
yes,"I am very agoraphobic. Nearly every time when I face a crowd, especially if they’re walking or standing close to me, I get more uncomfortable the longer it takes, always feeling the frustrated urge to escape as soon as possible. The more frequently it occurs within a period, the more numb & stressed I get. My agoraphobia is currently my main source of stress."
no,Pretty much as the title says. I need help please connect if anyone from this area?
no,i haven’t felt this anxious in a while. i haven’t been to a concert in like 6 years. i’m super anxious and i’ve been trying not to throw up all morning.
yes,"I've been suffering nonstop since 19 now 26 with my open space anxiety. Im tired of being home, im tired of family holding certain shit above my head because they know they can because they're my only option, im tired of being poor, I wanna run away. Im a man I wanna stand on my own 2 feet and not feel this way but it seems never ending. Im in therapy and I wanna hold it together to see if I can get my life back but I know I can't stay sane this way for the rest of my life."

no,"Scroll a lot, watch documentaries, read if I can persuade myself, meditate now & then, I’m trying to learn to play the guitar currently"
yes,"I feel like I can’t declare that I’m agoraphobic because I’m a single mum, don’t want to be judged as a parent. ...if it’s a good day I’ll stand at my front door and listen out for any neighbours and if I can’t hear them I’ll really quickly take my rubbish to the bins and run back in the house"
yes,"Disappoint my family, ... , smoke weed, and play vidya."
yes,"I worry, cry"

no,"I lift,do cardio and relax"
no,I am curious how old everyone replying is as well

yes,I also have lots of Dr's appointments.
yes,"I have started working on it again recently, but before that's all I did. Just dissappear into those worlds. Now I'm in a dbt intensive outpatient and am having to face it all again."

yes,unless depressed may be a 10x slower day and will most likely sleep to avoid life
yes,a consultant psychiatrist
no,Been denied 5 times and On my second hearing currently in Oklahoma and totally relate!
yes,I don’t have the same abilities as “normal” people and that’s nothing to be ashamed of. You deserve to have support and if that means labelling your agoraphobia as a disability then that’s okay!
yes,it’s incredibly hard to make friends when you don’t leave the house.
no,Are u on medication ?
no,What games have you been playing recently?
yes,Everytime im not doing something I’m on Reddit looking for the golden answer
no,...and we are we...
yes,"I feel guilty that my fear of outside has given her this chore, so I’ll force myself to do it, but the moment I step outside I feel like I’m being watched. I hate it."
yes,i started mirtazapine in december of 2022 but really noticed a big difference around september of 2023 when i added beta blockers!
no,And I am me
yes,"I think they’re judging how much trash I put out. Like oh, that’s a lot for one person or something. ... I know the other neighbors don’t think of each other the way they think of me, thanks to a neighbor who spreads all kinds of rumors. By keeping to myself I don’t exactly prove them wrong!"
yes,I’m on latuda seeing if that will work
no,WE ARE THE WORLD. WE ARE THE CHILDREN
no,"Me too but once it hits 10pm I feel it’s too late, because I separate my rubbish, so cans and plastic go in one bin, main rubbish goes in another bin and card is another bin, and the main and card are fine, but my plastic makes a massive crash noise when I empty it all into the bin so I have to do it before everyone is asleep hahah. Hey, if it helps, my neighbours suck too, I have one nice neighbour who doesn’t care about anything I do, but one that hates my guts and one that is nosey and comes out anytime they see me just to see what I’m doing. Just ignore your nasty neighbours. That’s what I do, stay out their way and do your own thing, they are clearly super unhappy within themselves if they’re so interested in what you do, obsessed much. And keeping to yourself isn’t a crime, nor is it weird!! I’d rather my neighbours kept to themselves. Nothing worse than a nosey neighbour! We aren’t the weird ones, they are."
yes,don’t know why I let them get into my head
no,[deleted]
no,Sure.
no,Hey having trouble with the chat. I’ll keep trying
yes,"I'm so scared to go outside, I had this fear of being mocked or assaulted like I had in the past when I was in high school. I'm unable to go outside for basic things like a walk or eating a lunch on the park."
no,I haven’t found one that does home visits - my doctors do though - however many virtual therapists may be willing to do video or phone calls during exposures so you could have your phone with you while they talk you through it etc
no,They can do online meetings
no,I dont think therapist do this but you find a social worker who can help
no,I dont find that helpful because outside phone connection isn't reliable
no,What do you mean? Like cell service? I didn’t mean on a laptop but just phone or video call and then you can take the phone outside the front door or to the mail or whatever exposure you are working on at the moment
yes,"I still struggle to go to grocery stores, I haven’t eaten out in 3 years, but this is my first huge step to freedom. Did I panic nonstop the last few days? Absoutley. I made myself sick with panic."
yes,"I developed agoraphobia 4 years ago, my fear stemmed a lot from being in the car which made it hard to hang out with friends and family at first. My biggest fear is pushing people away because of my anxiety and making it hard to meet new people because of my specific fear with transportation. I get so embarrassed of panicking in front of others, it leads me to thoughts of depression and loneliness."
yes,"I've basically been home bound since 2020, work from home and barely socialise/see my friends. I struggle to exercise or go out to do my shopping, everything comes to me."
yes,I have Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia attending college from home due to these conditions.
yes,"i asked to stay in the car at first bc they were going to costco and it was kinda intimidating and i had a panic attack :/ but soon after,, i got over it and basically told myself to suck it up and i went to multiple stores and stayed out for ~4 hours!!"
yes,"I am terrified, scared, you name it - but I know I have to finally just do it. I will be facing a lot of trauma and horrible memories, but I am also excited to see my family and be back 'home'."
yes,i am so anxious about being alone. i hate being alone. im literally crying. im 30 years old and cant handle being by myself....
yes,I used to get anxious there even before I had agoraphobia because I didn't like to be so far from home.
yes,"I am feeling pretty hopeless, I am in therapy and doing small exposure steps. But feeling like I’ll be stuck like this forever, and will never be “normal”. I am even on medication (sertaline), but it dosent seem to help as much as needed."
yes,Most exposures sound impossible without it.
no,That’s all. And it was an hour and a half. Feels like a win.
yes,my heart races and my breath catches in my chest whenever I hear White neighbors' voices even outside my door.
yes,i’ve suffered from agoraphobia since 2021. i start nursing school in september. i only have panic attacks if i leave the house. i know the steps are to try and get out the house each day further than the next. i’m just so scared that the ativan won’t let me at all or will make me feel high?
yes,"The summer time is also a difficult time for me because the bright sun, loud noises, humidity, access traffic etc. all trigger me. It’s all ONE for me. You may hear sounds and feel things individually, “that’s a motorcycle, that’s a car, wow it’s hot today”, whereas for me, it’s one big sensory overload that I feel at once, hitting me like a ton of bricks."
yes,"I try to limit alcohol on days before office days but yesterday it went wrong. I drank one beer at lunch with my wife. Had a glass of wine at diner. That should have been it but I was hanging with friends and one drink of whisky turned into like 200ml. I was drunk when I got home, fell asleep for 6 hours, showered and headed out to work. About two coffee in at 11 this morning I was suddenly spiraling. Jittery, on edge, couldn't breathe properly, couldn't swallow, felt like being out of my own body. I told them I felt sick and would continue working from home the rest of the day. I could barely talk, it felt like I'm losing my mind, hyperfocused on my throat drinking water and keeping focus on my body."
no,"Hi, I have a loved one who has agoraphobia specific to situations that only come up a couple of times a year. It seems to be related to traveling, so I’m never physically near by when it happens. What are some ways I can be supportive and what things would be most helpful for me to do?"
yes,I've been incredibly anxious...I have been very bad...struggle to go to new places...anxiety of disappointing my parents...I was crying in under half an hour and couldn't stop thinking about general anxiety thoughts...unable to eat or drink in public alone...makes me really uncomfortable.
yes,"My executive functioning is poor, like to the point where I am barely able to keep myself and the house clean and feed myself appropriately. Alongside that is this feeling that I have to look a certain way before leaving the house in order to not stick out like a sore thumb, and it is so overwhelming."
yes,I struggle daily...I struggle going to the cinema without having an aisle seat so I really don't know how to deal with this but I have to. I can't ruin the night for my friends and I deserve it to myself to have fun. Wish I could just be normal and not have to worry like this.
yes,"My agoraphobia is really bad, In the last few years i've left a handful of times, last time was 9 months ago and I haven't stepped out since."
yes,"since symptoms of anxiety and gerd flared up again so much so that now i cannot travel outside of my gated community alone , if my parents accompany me i can go any where but if i try to leave alone my acid reflux flares up , my chest hurts its like cant breathe , i have extreme tremors and feels like i will have another panic attack"
yes,I have been agoraphobic for 9 years now. I don’t have the energy to go out and be social and do things like most people. I feel so weighed down and tired more than ever before about my living and financial situation.
yes,I couldn’t seem to get myself out the door... I still had to mentally keep track of the nearest restroom just in case I needed it—and even left long lines to use the restroom... I rode 6 rides total and I had fun! ...this whole experience was good exposure therapy for me... Next goal as someone with toilet anxiety: ...
yes,i already have disdain for a lot of public spaces ... but then there’s also the literal fear of those spaces… i’ve become such a lonely person because of agoraphobia and being autistic means i have so little motivation to actually solve it
yes,"I used to love driving; now, I can barely get on a road without white-knuckles, hyperventilating... I'm fucking scared of the sun... I couldn't even put my hand on the knob of the front door. How do you explain to others that type of TERROR. Absolutely illogical and fully engulfing terror."
yes,"When i panic i just want to go home. I always want a toilet very close to me, if not than i feel like i need a toilet and i feel anxiety. So usually when i feel anxiety i want to go to the toilet. Im not really looking for exits but scanning for toilets where ever i go."
no,In the last year or so I’ve really gotten into reading! It’s nice to lessen my screen time and have something to dive into before bed. What are your must read books? 📚
yes,Lots of childhood trauma. I think that primed me to be extra anxious and fried my nervous system as a kid.
yes,I had severe panic driving to the location. ... I let the feelings flow through me without resisting. ... I ate my breakfast while still experiencing high levels of anxiety. ... I watched them like I was watching tv. ... I accepted that anxiety had come along for the ride and was now sharing the bench. ... I sat on that bench for 30 minutes feeling the waves of anxiety ebbing and flowing.
yes,"Then one day out of the blue while getting prepared to leave the house to attend a friends birthday party something I can only describe as a bomb went off inside my chest this was quickly followed by a feeling of pure panic, sweating and an overwhelming feeling of I CAN NOT GO. I remember clinging on to the railing in my bathroom trying to make sense of what was happening as my heart beat out of my chest I had maybe had the odd panic attack in my life but nothing like this, this was something else entirely something that physically and mentally made me feel almost broken."
yes,"I used to love going out on the boats and now I can’t even fathom the idea of being away from a stall for hours. Yesterday, I had a panic attack for the first time and had to get off the bus to calm down."
yes,I didn’t know what to do so I just nodded my head at every stupid question he asked me.
yes,"My life has turned upside down, I got really sick tapering off Klonipin (benzodiazepine) after taking it for 8 years for my panic disorder/agoraphobia, just for it to come back full force. I’ve lost my job I’ve lost friends, I’m home bound again I developed POTS which is physically debilitating, and now my dads on hospice care very suddenly"
yes,my teeth issues are severe
yes,I have agoraphobia...not feeling safe anywhere.
yes,"yesterday i went only about 2 miles away from home and had severe anxiety at the shops, i felt trapped and felt as if something terrible was going to happen to me, i felt lost, i kept checking my pockets, and i returned home immediately."
yes,I keep cancelling therapy and doctors appointments.
yes,I have no degrees and need a job to support me and my 2 year old
yes,I get anxious even just seeing a stadium that big with that many people and I struggle to comprehend how all these people are so okay being in that environment... I can't even go to the shop down the road or for a walk outside unless it's dark
yes,"I remember being in Costco in June and getting a panic attack there because I saw people wearing masks and hoarding items. I called my mom to pick me up because I felt that I couldn't drive myself back, but I calmed down, and drove my car back."
yes,"I couldn’t leave my house and failed my first 2 quarters at university due to how bad it was. I was completely reliant on my bf at the time to get groceries and make sure I stayed alive. I still have anxiety, and agoraphobic episodes. I still have panic attacks around events where I know there’s no “escape”."
yes,I was scared as FUCKK especially bc 1. Being in a car for an hour with no bathroom whilst having ibs and a fear of peeing/ crapping my pants and 2. Being too far away from home and with people i don’t rlly know.
yes,I struggle with agoraphobia and severe anxiety since february 2024. Today i went to a small store with my mom and immediately started panicking in the store. It made me feel very sad and upset ..struggling with agoraphobia makes me feel really depressed at times. I feel like im losing myself and everything i loved. I feel nauseous or i feel like i have to pee all the time its so suffocating
yes,took me about 3-4 minutes of getting up the courage to open the door
yes,I've been feeling pretty awful lately because of my agoraphobia and anxiety... I'm starting to lose my will to recover because every time I take a step forward I take ten steps back... I have a medication but it's not working and in order for me to start a new one I should stop taking my old one but the withdrawal is something I don't have the mental energy to go through right now.
yes,"I have been feeling lightheaded in public sometimes. Along with the lightheadedness, I sometimes get some dizziness, I feel a bit unsteady and ""floaty"", sometimes I feel like the floor is tilting, and I'm walking to the left a bit and that I may faint (but I don't)."
yes,"I imagine dysfunction and I manifest it. I tell myself I can't do something, and I fumble or avoid. I'll use others for support and divert them from their desires and activities to supplement my confidence because my imagination is so effective."
yes,"I'm really comfortable with having an emergency excuse to avoid people and anything social. My life really hasnt changed much since lockdown started in March, if anything, it's made things better. Nobody is really pitying me anymore for being a depressive loser and staying home all day, which was basically how I lost most of my friendships in the past several years."
yes,"I couldn’t shake the thought of people seeing me that way because it made me feel so weak and exposed since I couldn’t control it. I was bullied for many other things like my clothes, my voice, my awkwardness, and the way I looked. I became fixated on my inability to control my face being red and it spilled into all aspects of myself I felt were vulnerable to me. I grew self conscious and so easily overwhelmed over everything. I tried exposure therapy in small ways but time and time again the moment I feel my face get red I have a panic attack and when this happens in public my agoraphobia worsens. Now I feel shame, embarrassment, and anxiety to a point I can’t say hi to a cashier without breaking out in bright red splotchy marks. Walking to the parking lot crying and shaking to have another panic attack."
no,"Bout to go to the store for the first time in awhile. I'm gonna leave this here and see how many upvotes and "" Atta' boys "" I get when I get back. ♥️"
yes,"I’ve avoided concerts for two years now due to the agoraphobia and panic/anxiety. ... I’m worried of having a panic attack. ... I don’t want to miss out because I already missed out on a smaller one tonight due to the agoraphobia and I feel really left out as it looked fun, I just know it’ll be bad tomorrow too. ... I kinda want to go but just cannot picture myself going it feels too hard and just impossible I could go to an event like that right now."
yes,it’s like a totally valid excuse to stay inside that everyone uses...like please that’s perfect agoraphobia weather 😭
yes,i've got my 'anxiety bag' all packed. here i go. update: i ... avoided a panic attack all together.
yes,I felt like I couldn't do it anymore. I started messaging my parents and telling them to come meet me at a nearby town to pick me up. Today is that next day and I bawled my eyes out twice and had 3 panic attacks within 3 hours after getting to work. I have so much pressure on me and I'm exhausted.
yes,Very small bit of anxiety... overcoming agoraphobia and hope I can ease my panic disorder to live a semi- reg life.
yes,I was on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about it.
yes,I’ve had agoraphobia on and off for 8-9 months now and it’s super frustrating and debilitating. I try to do things that give me anxiety like driving or sitting outside for a bit. I’ve had previously bad panic attacks in my car.
yes,I've been in a severe depression and going anywhere is like only happening if someone goes with me. I feel like I'll be triggered and sob.
yes,"When I was at my worst, I was calling ambulances every single day, and sleeping in the emergency room, I didn't even feel safe at home, only in the ER. Eventually, I admitted myself to a psych ward against the doctor's suggestions, and it just turned out to be a traumatizing experience for a day (Witnessed some disturbing treatment by the staff)."
yes,"I don't go outside unless I really really have to for food or doctors appointments, which very often I'll reschedule or miss the appointment all together and when it comes to food I'll sometimes eat down to every last thing before I can conjure up the courage to go out. I sometimes don't even want to take trash out. I can only go so far when I do go out. I've had panic attacks when I have gone outside. I don't have any friends. I don't go to any outings even family functions. I'll go very rarely to a park early hours or basically nighttime so I'm not really being seen or perceived. Hate hate hate public transport. When I do go out I'm literally wearing all black and hoodie and long pants year round. I don't work and haven't worked in sometime. Most days I am not even living in my home I'm holed up in my room 24/7."
yes,"Sometimes my mind wants to torture me and I start thinking about the idea of never recovering from this. Never having a normal life and always relying on the support of others and never being able to step up and contribute to society and my family in any meaningful way. It kind of horrifies me, especially because I’m still young. It’s like I’m stuck in a nightmare I can’t wake up from."
yes,"I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but I'm significantly improved. I no longer feel tense or anxious at the thought of leaving the house."
yes,Anxiety started to kick in but I put on my favorite podcast and made it through.
yes,i'm afraid of stealing the attention by feeling bad or something. im a little too nervous to manage to eat there
yes,"I developed panic disorder. A few years later it spiraled into agoraphobia... I stopped exercising, getting out, seeing people... It was hell and I was essentially housebound for a while. Called crisis lines, wanted to die, it wasn't good... I feel almost completely 'healed' when I'm with my partner, but like I haven't made any progress alone... having a full blown 'I'm gonna die' panic attack from walking down the street alone, is.... Insane."
yes,"I felt great today and was really excited and confident about making this small progress. I got home and my sister asked where I went and I told her the route I took. She laughed and said it was a sad walk, completely taking the wind out of my sails."
yes,"My agoraphobia relapsed recently and I freaked out, left uni and came home. So much of me wants to drop out and curl up in bed forever."
yes,struggling with panic disorder and agoraphobia I contribute it to being in jail

yes,severe agoraphobia or acne related agoraphobia
yes,"I can’t even leave the room by myself. When I have to leave the room alone, it gives me a lot of anxiety."
yes,Ever since my agoraphobia got worse i can't Socialize for shit. I don't wanna talk to people. I don't wanna go places. People try talking to me but i just have no longer an interest. I just want to be with my pets and sit in silence and that's it. I'm scared of all people. I don't trust people. I have major fear and disgust of humans.
yes,"I was prepared to combat anxiety with different techniques but this time I didn’t need to use them because I didn’t have anxiety. When the dreadful thought “you’re too far away from home, you can’t get back quickly” came to my mind I shoved it aside and would not allow myself to dwell on it."
yes,"I haven't left the house in...god knows how long. I can barely go to the store down the street. I'm absolutely miserable. ...having to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes from the severe anxiety. I feel so hopeless, and I just know there is no point in even living a life like this. Agoraphobia is 100% ruining my life."
no,"Came back here for a positive post and to maybe give people some hope. I am 90% recovered. I can go to work, go out to places I could never before ( a bar, ON A DATE). I say 90% because I still haven’t attempted to eat at a real sit down restaurant and some situations still make me very comfortable. I am not on any medication, I do go to therapy weekly. I did have my first panic attack in awhile yesterday about going to the casino with a family member that I am not comfortable with ( I still went ). I’m not sure how I’ve gotten better, definitely more confident in myself now than before."
yes,I barely slept. I don’t feel well physically and I’m having trouble not freaking out (I have emetophobia too). I feel like sobbing. I feel like so stupid and in the way and I’m so angry at myself.
yes,"I became terrified and unable to drive on highways... I started avoiding highways and of course things started to get worse to where I began avoiding any wide Open road or intersection... I spend all day worrying and obsessing about my next drive, my next walk, the next time I go to a big box store."
yes,"I started going less and less places...I became restless in class and couldn’t focus...I was able to go other places. Then I graduated and felt like I had nothing going for me. All my friends left to go to college and I felt alone...I went to some stores and had several panic attacks...I went on a run once around the neighborhood and became extremely ill and had an attack...I now zone out a lot, I feel dull. It’s like I’m not there. Everyday is the same...I panic, but I know I’m safe in my house and that it’ll go away. I’m fatigued afterwards. I sleep a lot at odd times. Sleep schedule is terrible."
yes,I'll do weeks of improvement Then something will trigger me and I'll back slide MONTHS of progress. I feel exhausted and honestly unbelievably embarrassed because strangers have witnessed my freeze and panic attacks.
no,"I struggled with panic disorder and agoraphobia for 15 years, and it SUCKED! But I recovered 6 years ago, and although it was super hard, I want you to know that it IS possible. Sending love to anyone struggling. You are so incredibly strong and capable, don't give up!!"
yes,I had to quit because I keep having panic attacks...my agoraphobia is disabling and I remember it's a disability.
no,"What type of life do you think you would you live ? I think I would have stayed in school, never left my friends and bought a house by now. It’s never too late though."
yes,I made it to the store for the first time in 4 years!!! I also made it to a different part of town just down the road a different way I haven't been in like 6-7 years.
yes,"i am 20, almost 21. i have agoraphobia, depression, anxiety, etc, so i live at home with my parents still and im currently not working or studying or whatever... i dont see how im meant to get better when the people who raised me, who brought me into the world, act like im the worst thing thats ever happened to them. i have felt ignored and emotionally neglected by them my whole life... i sometimes wonder if my parents wish i would just die already so they wouldnt have to deal with me anymore. i kind of want to do it to make them feel bad. and i cannot continue living feeling so guilty and like such a burden for simply trying to keep myself alive"
yes,"I had everything from anxiety, depression, DPDR, agoraphobia, intrusive thoughts, and OCD. I was completely confused on what was happening and was constantly afraid. I reached a point where I couldn’t go anywhere without my mom and couldn’t be home alone… I lost about 30lbs in that span and thought I was going absolutely nuts and had schizophrenia lol."
yes,"I took a grade 3 concussion that left me having panic attacks and terrified to leave my bed. I was terrified to shower, I was terrified to eat, I was terrified to open the front door, etc. to say the least it was horrible. I had panic attacks three times a day and nothing seems to work."
yes,I get increasingly anxious of taking a shower. I have started to associate showers with getting out of the house so I stopped. I'm having sever anxiety from the thought of at least showering to look presentable on video.
yes,My mind is racing about everything. Not even anxiety things. Yes also anxiety but that was when is was 6 oclock and i knew i messed up. Anxiety attack in bed about not being able to sleep. Tingling legs etc
yes,"The heat causes me to feel like I can’t breathe, and if I’m in a hot car, I become extremely claustrophobic and start panicking."
yes,I'm afraid to go outside unless someone I trust is with me.. I am so afraid to be with people it prevents me from getting a job... I'm so scared to go outside because I'm afraid I'll be attacked or found by my crazy family... I can't even go to the grocery store.. I can't have a job
yes,I haven’t been on a plane since 2018 where I suffered a huge panic attack on a flight to Poland & I haven’t travelled much further than an hour from my house without my parents in the last 8 years. I woke up in immense panic and started throwing up. A big trigger for me is motorways as there’s been multiple occasions where I’ve had bad panic attacks on them and the inability to escape sends me into an attack pretty easily. I feel massive amounts of shame and embarrassment and I feel very weak.
yes,I had a panic attack on a gondola last weekend and decided I need to ramp up the intensity. I felt trapped on both and even had a limited symptom attack. I just kept going back and the panic got less and less.
yes,"I had severe panic attacks and Agoraphobia. I usually was thinking all the time 'im x minutes away from home, what if i panic now' etc."
no,I felt inspired to write this. I am a 37 year old PD and Agoraphobia survivor. I say survivor because essentially I can say with confidence that I overcame Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and now live what I consider to be a normal life after many years plagued with the disorder. ...
yes,"I'm anxious because I get myself so worked up, I'm unfamiliar with the surroundings, don't like being anxious in public areas (not because of people but it just makes me feel so vulnerable, exposed, uncomfortable) and certain scenarios are triggers for me"
yes,"I haven't left the house with the exception of going to the ER for panic attacks... I started leaving the house less and less... I feel scared that I might freak out with nowhere to escape... I'm afraid to shower because last time I did that, I had a panic attack in the shower... I felt twitchy and shaky, heart racing and dizzy."
yes,I'm scared!
yes,I have really bad social anxiety and I usually go to the store with one of my parents. I don’t go to the store that often let alone leave the house. I have fear of being alone. I don’t go outside my house even though I often want to. I get depressed that I feel isolated in my own house because I’m afraid to go outside.
yes,"my Tangle toy, an Ativan, and my spinner ring that says 'You fucking got this' on it"
yes,I feel I have both and it's destroying my life.
yes,"I managed to eat ~60% of it over the course of a few weeks... And that, my friends, was my biggest accomplishment of the year. I went to the grocery store for less than ten minutes, seven months ago. It's pathetic, but please be proud of me."
yes,I lay in bed all day everyday (for the past 3-4years) and rarely leave my bedroom. I try to learn new skills/things but I have a hard time enjoying it and learning stuff it also feels like too much work. My hygiene is pretty bad too I won't take shower for weeks sometimes months. I'm having trouble getting out of bed to even try to do anything now I'm just withering away slowly. everything is too much.
yes,"I have had panic attacks at work for 3 years now, it's gone up and down in severity but I'm to the point where I can only work 2 out of 10 days in a two week period. I thought I was fine last week, I thought I could manage it. I got to work at 9, full panic attack by 10. I cannot tell anyone I'm having these because that would result in a full public meltdown that I don't know if I can come back from. I just have the panic attack and then wait for the swelling to go down before acting like every thing is okay. It's exhausting, I feel so sick after. "
yes,I was not looking forward to my birthday at all because last years was so bad that it caused a relapse of agoraphobia. But… I let my best friend come in the house and then my other friends mom came in and stayed for an hour! Its so refreshing to just have a day where I don’t freak out.
yes,i was really scared at first and now i’m so proud of myself
yes,"I've gained 60+ pounds. I've lost friends. I've lost my carrier. I haven't been to the dentist in 15 years. I haven't physically seen a doctor in 7 years. I have missed weddings, funerals and births. I might loose my license because going for a photo renewal is beyond my capability."
yes,"was extremely nervous about it, it eventually got to the point where I was able to keep walking while my dad stopped at a store to use the bathroom. I walked around half the perimeter of the building by myself before I sat down at a bench to catch my breath."
no,"I live in a major city and began developing mild to moderate Agoraphobia after having a panic attack on stage in early 2022 while at a conference. Slowly, I began to get triggered by quiet (audience) structured places like movies, performing arts, church, the office, etc"
yes,"I spend alot of time on Google maps...streets viewing places I used to go for walks...whenever I Google maps these places a sense of sadness and longing comes over me, I feel like the part of my life...is over, it will take YEARS of work before I could ever even just hop on the bus again without having absolutely excrutiating panic that makes me want to off myself just to make it stop"
yes,"i’ve had agoraphobia for over two years now, it started with a bunch of panic attacks that lasted a month. i was slowly getting better and then the pandemic happened so i got even worse. it’s been about 2 years since i left the house fully. ssris have made me so ill in this time, anxiety has gotten worse, panic attacks more frequent. i feel like im a lost cause and i don’t know where to go that will help me so i can get my life back. i just feel so defeated and lonely."
yes,I'm so angry and bored and lonley
yes,I'm agoraphobic...the thought of wanting to go home as fast as possible never leaves my head and when I get home I'm terrible exhausted as if I had trained for a national competition...I can't go that far away without my anxiety making me shut down and losing it...Agoraphobia has stole so many things from me through the years.
yes,hard to connect with people who don’t
yes,I get panic attacks and a lot of anxiety while driving and even while being in the car as a passenger.
yes,"I live at home and claim benefits from agoraphobia but my home life is too anxiety inducing, it actually impedes me doing things because my mum puts me down so often"
yes,I’ve been cutting my own hair for the last 6 years. I was really awkward and embarrassed but I’m proud that I did it.
yes,"it makes me feel like I’m going to throw up, shit myself and pass out all at the same time"
yes,"I’ve been in a rut with agoraphobia since December of 2018. Prior to that, I was able to work for 3 years."
yes,"so since agoraphobia has taken over my life about 3 years ago, ive lost most of my friends. i unintentionally created a distance because of my overwhelming anxiety. i feel alone."
yes,"I get sad and a bit depressed because I think I am ruining my life by staying home all the time and not hanging out with friends since months, I guess its logical im feeling lonely and cant do outdoors activities. I always was anxious about that if my anxiety/agoraphobia would give me depression and i get scared of that idea."
yes,I haven't left my home in the better part of two years. I'm only 17 and i feel like my anxieties and undiagnosed agoraphobia have been ruining my life
yes,I feel like i just haven't done anything productive for years and watch everyone pass me by while I sit and suffer. Nothing seems to help or motivate me and I just wanna check out
yes,"I'm utterly alone. No one can help me, and I'm too broken to help myself. ...we're essentially just watching each other slowly wither away. I'm glad that I have her to talk to, and that we can both understand each other so well, but at the same time we only intensify each other's depression and things are only getting worse and worse."
yes,I’m terrified I’ll get a panic attack in class or even before.
yes,I cannot even leave my house. I cannot even stay home alone. It has a HUGE impact on my life and I want to change my situation.
yes,"I've been with my bf for 6 years, my agoraphobia didn't start until 3 years during the relationship. ... I'm scared i'm not going to find someone who is willing to put up with my anxiety, depression and panic attacks."
yes,"I have had social anxiety for over ten years and I became agoraphobic over the years from there...I had to take the ride with my mother, with someone I trust enough to be able to listen to me when I tell them 'stop, turn around, go home.' It was the first time I've been outside the fence of the property in two years and it terrified me...I practiced breathing exercises and made my mother stop the car if my panic got to be too much...I just want to be better now, to have a life but I need to be patient."
yes,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, PTSD, OCD, and bipolar 2 after I had my daughter 7 years ago. I can’t stand for any long amount of time without severe nerve pain. I also have agoraphobia due to my severe social phobia, and haven’t driven in years because of it, and also struggle going to grocery stores or any large events."
yes,tried going on my first solo drive after a while and immediately felt a panic attack coming and pulled over and my parents came and got me
yes,I feel like dying
yes,nowhere is safe for me. that feeling follows me everywhere. i feel like i'll vomit my heart. my whole body gets numb. there's no way to escape. i run around places to find a way to breathe but i feel like everywhere is a cage for me.
yes,"I’ve noticed the worst part really is the drive to wherever I’m going and the first 10 minutes there. I’ve been good at positive affirmations while driving so I don’t escalate to panic attacks, but I do still sit with a lot of panic."
yes,After an entire year of working through two years of agoraphobic anxiety... I just keep forcing myself through the steps because I want this life back so badly.
no,"DARE , by Barry mcdonagh. He also has a really helpful app, and workbook. Changed my life"
no,"I use the Internet Archive, where at least some books you can make an account and borrow online. I did a search for Agoraphobia: https://archive.org/search?query=agoraphobia"
no,"The Panic Switch, Hope and Help for Your Nerves, Dare, The Power of Now"
no,This. Also Badass ways to end anxiety & stop panic attacks! by Geert Verschaeve is a good one with similar approach
no,"I was suffering with agoraphobia for months it got to such a stage where i was to afraid to leave my own bedroom, it took me months of consistent exposure work to pull myself out of that spot and now i feel pretty much cured, i still have anxious thoughts about going places but i dont let these thoughts control my actions. Now something ive realised is the hard truth of the matter is agoraphobia can only be beaten by being brave and actively putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, your not gonna suddenly wake up one day feeling cured. It doesnt have to be massive, you dont have to throw yourself into a city straight away you build up to that point through small steps, like going through short walks. Chances are your gonna feel pretty bad on your first exposures, but every exposure is a success, and its about learning and realising that your uncomfortable symptoms dont last forever and how every little exposure no matter how small is chipping away at that beast. Also keep in mind your not gonna be cured in a week of doing exposures, it personally took me several months to get to the point i at now, recovery is messy but it feels so good when you feel it clicking together. Believe me i know how horrible those feelings feel, but they dont last forever and they certainly will not kill you. Im rambling a bit haha but i just wanted to say how the only way your gonna beat this beast is by being a brave motherfucker and taking the bull by the horns, you may not feel brave but you certainly are, anxiety sufferers are some of the bravest people out there because their fighting everyday, over things that most people take for granted."
yes,"I sit indoors all day watching netflix, playing xbox and scrolling social media. I get insane anxiety anytime I go anywhere even if its just to Walmart or Target. I feel crazy sometimes and like a hermit. I have practically no friends anymore because I always decline hangout offers (haven't hung out with anyone but my gf or family in over a year now) so I'm pretty lonely most days"
yes,"I'll start to feel like I can't breathe, and I'll hold my breath to the point of feeling very lightheaded... I was significantly worried about being infected, feels like only a year, but apparently it's been 4."
yes,I'm paranoid and anxious about the smallest thing. I feel like I'm not even a person anymore. I can't bare to take care of myself anymore. I'm a mess
yes,"she described agoraphobia as “personally it’s feeling super panicky, anxious and overwhelmed when going outside!! it’s rlly hard for me to go anywhere on my own or without my heart wanting to explode. crowds, noises, etc. are super overwhelming.”"
yes,"I had a mental break, ended up in inpatient two months later and forced myself into poly to try and save my new marriage. I’m going to gloss over all of that and just say it nearly killed me. Everything fell apart and I was disposed of after thinking I finally “figured it out”. Oh, and I lost my kid, too, another long story. I kept thinking I’ll never be able to call my wife again and I just immediately, and completely relapsed into extreme panic, anger, and agoraphobia. I couldn’t even be home alone those first few weeks. I just can’t seem to find a med that works, either. Paxil made me obsess thinking about killing her, Lexapro made me feel like my head was cotton candy, and I know how addictive Xanax is to not use it but for extreme situations. I had a panic attack earlier today due to being out in rush hour, but at least for the next several years; I have no other choice but to expose."
yes,feel like all they do is cry
yes,"ive dealt with anxiety since i was very young and was able to push through it up until an incident in which i was in a car with my family when i felt sick (emetophobia) and when i voiced my fear i was met with sounds of annoyance and the increase of music in the car to drown me out, i then went on to panic for the next 2 hours silently as to not ruin their experience. that was four years ago and ever since then its been difficult for me to eat full meals when far from home , sit in traffic, and just generally feel relaxed in public ."
yes,I never leave the house. I don't drive. No one is answering.  I need to call the emergency vet but I'm afraid. I gotta call them I gotta go ! I may have to Uber but I'm afraid and how am  i gonna pay with no income.
yes,"Had a panic attack in Walmart 6 years ago never went back. I hate Lowe’s, big warehouse places. (Bright lights, shiny floors etc)"
yes,I know agoraphobia is a little tricky to manage at times and I was sitting and thinking because that’s what having all that time and space in the house does to you…
no,"i’m so happy. it was a really positive experience, no proper panic attacks. I felt actually how i imagined normal would feel like. i’m actually recovering. insane feeling."
yes,"I'm severely agoraphobic and don't feel ready to go by myself... Every time I go 'oh... maybe we'll come back in an hour...' and he always just goes 'okay, fine' and then it never happens... I had a bit of a breakdown before and said how I fail at everything and that my 20s have been wasted locked in my house, and that I'm sick of it."
yes,"my anxiety is mainly related to the fear of not being able to go to the toilet and making a mess. Outdoor activities give me nightmares: what if there ISN'T a bathroom when I need it? I couldn't even be sincere to my therapist so I just gave up. I keep up a good facade, so people cannot imagine that I am distressed, but I am. It's tiring. It's been years."
no,"Hi guys, I'm not on any medication right now and I want to keep it that way as much as possible. Two days ago I bought L-Theanine 200mg capsules and I take it every night before I go to sleep. I'm thinking of getting Magnesium Glycinate, Can I take it together with L- Theanine or do you have any tips on what are you guys taking?"
yes,"I will tell myself I’m so ready and try to head outside, but I absolutely cannot make myself do it. I have a hard time listening to my body for cues about how I’m really feeling though."
yes,"Car accidents, muggings, mass shootings, racist attacks, bigoted attacks as a whole, rapists, bears, ticks that make you allergic to fking food, I mean the more I learn about life the more I want no parts of it. The idea or task of going outside makes me irate, angry, fearful, annoyed, disgusted, all at once."
yes,"I had severe panic attacks in the car, I still get picky about who drives the car and such. I just get anxious when someone new is in the car, uber or other types of transportation."
yes,"not leaving the house, doing nothing... anxious all the time... Haven’t worked since. Can’t remember last time I was in a grocery store or anything like that."
yes,I didn't leave the house for 2 or 3 years. At one point I couldn't go to the edge of my property for more than 10 minutes. I panicked every time I got the mail or took out the trash.
yes,The first one to do is to cross the crosswalk by my house (while a car waits). Fingers crossed I don’t panic :(
yes,"I woke up after what felt like forever laying on the floor. I went back to school and kept living life normally until I finished 9th grade and broke up with my abusive boyfriend that I'd been with for a year. I had been living my life constantly in fight or flight mode around him and everywhere. In the summer before 10th grade I made plans to get the covid vaccine, while I was in the car with my mother she was telling me about a reaction she had to a vaccine once. It totally freaked me out and I started to have a panic attack , we were only a few minutes away from home. When we got home I ran out of the car and tried to run to the front door but I passed out while I was running, I fell and hit my head, the ambulance was called and I was fine. When I went back to school for 10th grade I was having a panic or anxiety attack about once every hour. I decided with my mom that I would have a week off school to get a handle on my anxiety. Once I came home that day I spent the next 5 months stuck in my house and I would never go back to school. I tried relax and told myself I would go back school soon. After a month of doing nothing I felt worse, I was constantly thinking about needles or injections and everytime I did I got that start of a panic attack feeling, so I avoiding talking or thinking about medical things. I had to register for homeschool and I struggled through the curriculum. I had panic attacks just from leaving my bed to study at my desk. I spent 16 hours a day watching tv in bed. By the 5th month I was having panic attacks just going to the bathroom. I shook with anxiety for a week straight and had major anxiety diarrhea, that made me super dehydrated. I was constantly crying for months, I was almost fully nocturnal, I'd have a panic attack if I was left alone. It was incredibly isolating and I seriously considered ending things."
yes,I purposely introduced 'what if' thoughts... A few minutes later I started feeling super faint and breathless and went back home - running! I do truly believe Panic Attacks are caused by our thoughts... I find it crazy how fast I was able to self initiate a Panic Attack.
yes,"I have been trying to do this since Wednesday, but I just couldn't do it. But today I made it! I only stayed there for a few minutes, but I am very happy I did it."
no,Just extremely excited about going out and voting. Baby steps.
no,"I'm from Chile. I work for a bank from home. This wednesday i had to go to the headquarters in the biggest city of the country, Santiago, which is like 150 miles away. I was panicking. I was so afraid to embarrass myself. I couldn't sleep the night before."
yes,My agoraphobia peaked during the pandemic...can’t do what I was able to do before. If anything it feels like I’ve lost over a year plus of progress.
yes,Had some anxiety but didn’t let it stop me.
yes,I barely talk to anyone but my family and still struggle to get out... I feel like I have no purpose at the minute and I hate not earning money.
yes,I've heard exercise is great for Agoraphobia and wanted to give it a go.
yes,I haven’t drove in months and just a few weeks ago I could barely go outside for longer than a few seconds.
yes,The ceilings in Walmart especially bother me - it's so weird. It makes me geniunely uncomfortable and the fluorescent lighting!!!
yes,"I haven't stepped foot into a store in 6 months now. ... I started having a fucking panic attack, and had to take some meds. ... I want my life back so bad. ... I had to pull over, wait for it to pass, then go back home. I have been having long COVID symptoms, so maybe it's spiking my anxiety again? ... I just know I don't want to feel like this anymore."
no,"I’m so fucking happy! I’ve always been afraid of open places, supermarkets and public transport.  However I have been doing exposure therapy for a while now and I swear it works.  Yesterday for example I saw a full bus and I was like ”Should I take it or not?”  I decided to ride it despite my anxiety.  One thing I’ve learned is that people are usually  pre occupied with themselves and don’t pay attention to you.  Don’t be afraid to look at your surrounding.  Another thing is that if you feel really anxious about going out,  try to  accept your anxiety.  Accept that it’s completely normal.   Accept that you might have a panic attack.   Accept that you will feel uncomfortable.   If you go out thinking ”What if....” you are just feeding your anxiety and agoraphobia.  Don’t pay that bitch any attention.  I’ve dropped all my safety behaviours now too which works.  For example looking at my phone when i’m anxious, avoiding eye contact,  avoiding situations and places that makes me anxious.   There is hope.  Don’t give up yall."
no,"me 21F and my boyfriend 22M have been dating for two years almost and I feel like it's kind of forming into what feels like just a friendship since we're so close. I feel like we've kind of lost that spark wise and I'm just looking for ways to spice things up besides the bedroom I just want to feel like, that spark is there and I can see in his eyes how much she's in love with me rather than having a day-to-day schedule. I am completely homebound currently so date night or anything outside of the home is encouraged not to be commented. what are some ways to spice things up and get that spark back?  Thanks in advance."
yes,I just feel more snugged in with the wall
yes,I worry it could take years and I'm getting a little depressed thinking about it. It is sometimes hard to feel like I'm not wasting my life away even though I can do a lot more than I could 6 months or a year ago and have genuinely good experiences again but I feel like I am missing something not being able to work like before.
yes,"Imagining the versions of my life in another state, dreaming of the life i could be living."
yes,I've had extreme anxiety eventually leading to agoraphobia since my first panic attack in late 2018. Its been about a year since treatment and ive fallen back in the hole of agoraphobia. I can no longer leave the house at all.
yes,i know it. i’m scared this illness is ruining my life.
yes,I had an anxiety attack and made the mistake of leaving instead of sticking it out there. My brain then automatically connected my work place with that anxiety attack and it literally took me months to not feel anxious before or while at work.
yes,"moving has been rough the last couple of years, as the pandemic was a huge trigger for me"
no,"I used to have a couple. It's usually a place you're free to leave at any time without having to explain yourself, for starters."
yes,I feel like myself being somewhere & if the surroundings around me relax me instead of making me anxious
no,"Wow, this is actually a great idea. Imma try this. Using high dopamine type rewards (like food or a treat, for example) to hopefully trigger positive feelings towards stressful environments. Brilliant."
yes,i'm housebound and have crippling anxiety... i had to drop out of school 3 years ago due to agoraphobia and im medicated but the meds don't work.
yes,"I have agoraphobia, i can't remember ever not having it... I was scared of being seen as weak, stupid, broken, being shunned in some way, etc."
yes,"After endless campaigning, a relapse into depression and a sense of hopelessness... battling agoraphobia for a decade to no avail"
error,No subreddit submission text provided
yes,"Feels like I’m so lost not knowing anyone like me, would be nice to talk to someone that gets me"
yes,"I suffer from panic disorder, agoraphobia, ADHD, intrusive thoughts (OCD)... my biggest intrusive thought is the fear of throwing myself out of the car on the high way."
yes,"I fear things are irrational or unnecessary. Like, open spaces. I also fear the fast things. I fear looking up at the sky. Deep water. I fear being around people...the list goes on and on."
yes,"was super nervous about going to the pharmacy today, ended up waiting a bit longer than i expected and started to panic"
yes,I developed a very strong case of a fear that something is gonna happen to my heart or something impending doom related is gonna happen to me. I’ve been having panic attacks anytime I try to get up and active.
yes,bedbound from agoraphobia and the mental effects of it (such as depression)
yes,"I've been in therapy for about 6 years now to treat my agoraphobia and panic disorder. I've been working really hard on getting better, one step at a time. It started with leaving the house to go to the end of the street, then the tram, bus etc. ... So here I am, 24 hours away and my mind is screaming to cancel the trip, run away and hide. I'm scared of having a panic attack, but mostly about not wanting to be wherever I am... wanting to be back home when I can't."
yes,"I’ve spent a decade mostly in my room alone. I’ve done exposure, all kinds of therapies, and it’s of course not an uphill slope. There’s times where things seem to get better and then there’s times where I feel worse than ever."
yes,"I'd get awkward upset and just silently walk out of school... I'd rather keep my hood than someone see my neck... its like my version of the umbrella. Meaning i can go out this summer ima jus act like mans not hot, im a different person without a hoody, completely different character, with the hoody its the agoraphobic me."
yes,"I started to have a panic attack, and was really embarrassed. ... I could feel panic starting to swell on me at the thought of them coming over."
yes,I went out on my own to the grocery store! It felt so terrible but good at the same time.
yes,Going from housebound to going out with someone is a huge step
no,Def counts!
no,Of course it’s a step!
yes,"making you anxious, then it’s progress...push the bounds of what you’re comfortable with bit by bit until you’re ready...not challenging yourself enough"
yes,lately im having scary intrusive thoughts. Its about self harm which i absolutely dont wanna do. The amount is increasing. Its getting annoying now..
yes,It feels like outside is just too big and it’s weighing me down. The feeling is most intense when walking on foot.
yes,i've been completely housebound with no possibility to get anywhere... i can leave the house just not that far alone
yes,"I thought I was just, built incorrectly, and I never could understand why it was so much more ungodly difficult to just leave the house for me than it is for other people."
yes,"I feel like I'm ready to die. I am fat. Poor. Lonely. I have so much to offer and no courage to do so. I am in a vicious cycle of shame, depression, elation, fight, and wallow."
yes,having a panic attack for 10 days straight
yes,"I have friends developing anxiety, feeling boxed up, completely losing their outgoing, vibrant selves during this time."
yes,I’m tired of this anxiety... I know I’m going deep down the map .. like I want to take my kids to the beach so bad but 2 hours ; I know once I hit traffic and tolls or even see unfamiliar signs that ima go crazy and have a full attack ! I hate this feeling ..
yes,I panic because I know they are out there waiting for someone to answer and I just beg to myself for them to go away.  It used to be worse where I even decided an escape plan going out through the back so I don't have to be inside awkwardly waiting for that person to leave.
yes,"I constantly have these thoughts that I won't get back home and won't see my family anymore because I feel constantly so sick from endless panic attacks that I can't eat, I am able to eat sometimes just little snacks and constantly have these thoughts I am gonna faint somewhere, vomit somewhere, that I will get sick and won't be able to travel home etc. or that my phone will stop working and I will be trapped here forever and I don't really know how to calm myself, I feel majority of the time that I am going to absolutely lose control over myself and have only a few moments a day where I feel somehow calm."
yes,I had a meltdown & flashbacks after catching whatever it was.
yes,"I am incredibly suicidal and have seen many people for it and nothing has improved, been going on for years. I don’t ever leave the house only for appointments, maybe once every 3 months. I don’t know if I can manage being away from my house and being seen all the time. And I don’t know how it would benefit me or help. But I also can’t take this anymore and don’t know what to do because I will die soon."
yes,Im so tired but I’m so scared to sleep. Im home alone tonight. Any little noise is scaring me and my dog. He can sense my anxiety. I just need to get through tonight. Im so scared I will get robbed or murdered or something bad like my dad showing up.
yes,how did you pull it off while being an agoraphobic
yes,"I have agoraphobia and can literally only get 5 mins away from my house in a car if that, on my exposures I literally have panic and to run home at this distance. I’m so far away from being able to go there comfortably and I know how anxious I will feel.."
yes,I'm scared to go to sleep because I know I'm going to wake up to an empty house. I'm struggling so much with being alone. I fear that it will become too much for me to calm down and I'll feel like I have no choice.
no,"Thats amazing and actually impressive. But everyone has his own pace. How long can you stay and do activities at that range? I dont have to know that but thats also important right. Like i can go 6km from my home too but i cannot work 6km from my house. Its not the distance but the feeling of being stuck etc..
But it sounds like your doing really well :
Keep up the good work! Im confident youre gonna recover by the look of your post"
no,Thank you for the encouraging words
yes,feeling a bit down today...got too anxious to go and ended up selling my tix. feeling so bummed out and disappointed in myself
yes,I am on extreme rare occasion able to go places outside if I am with someone who makes me feel safe.
yes,"i suffer from agoraphobia, and am almost entirely housebound. high heart rate for days, the shakes, panic attacks, the whole nine yards."
yes,"I'm currently on an exposure therapy protocol because I'm trying to get my life back after about a year of agoraphobia. I've found that hours after I do the exposure, i experience panic attacks in my home when i'm safe."
yes,I've been agoraphobic for a long time
yes,"Today I decided to go to a less busy grocery store at a time when it wasn't busy. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't fun but manageable. I didn't even plan to go inside but to just make it to the parking lot. I went in with my sister, went to the other end of the store, bought some drinks and went back home. I'm tired and a little stressed now but I can rest for the rest of the day."
yes,"I have been slightly agoraphobic as far back as I can remember. I never liked sleepovers as a kid, I didn’t like being away from home when we would visit our family in New York or Ocean City, I never faired well on bus trips to the countries capital for school. All this is to say I just thought I was an anxious kid. "
yes,"I had a massive panic attack while driving. Even though I was able to enjoy the trip, it ruined my feelings of driving. Shortly after, I stopped driving and haven’t left my road since 2021."
yes,"i have been diagnosed with agoraphobia 2 years ago, im making a progress daily, going out, i drove a bus for few little minutes, i can go to small corner shops and im very slowly recovering. im in a completely new city, i have no friends, my family lives their own life, so i ended up alone, miserable and its eating me the hell up."
yes,"I'm trying to go back to work after years of agoraphobia and it's really fucking hard... I'm afraid of other people, especially men... I feel like it's soooo dumb, like ooo my feelings got hurt... but it's so serious to me to the point that I've fully avoided people for years..."
yes,"I struggled to go anywhere. I eventually started to be able to go places, as long as my husband was with me. But now, I’m overly dependent upon my husband and it’s upsetting and scares me."
yes,feeling anxious thinking about it
yes,the thought of sitting in busy traffic freaks me out... I know it’s just claustrophobia and none of the uncomfortable sensations can hurt me
yes,I have been doing exposures all week and have been fine but just started my period and couldn’t even make it through my exposure today
yes,I can't stay out after dark
yes,I’m a agoraphobic
yes,I had some times where I wouldn’t leave my apartment for days... I had a panic attack just a bit ago because I needed to leave my apartment to do laundry... Every single part of my brain is telling me to shut down and stay home and never leave.
yes,"I feel like I'm completely worthless to the world because of my agorophobia... My anxiety is so bad I have a VERY hard time with phone calls, even just to make a Drs. appointment."
yes,"I haven’t been able to even do my virtual therapy sessions because everytime it sends me into a tailspin panic attack that has me throwing up the few fluids I’ve been able to keep down. I haven’t been this weak or thin in a long time. I’ve barely been able to keep tiny bits of food down. I’m at a loss. I’ve tried to push through but it doesn’t ever end, and I just get weaker and weaker. So now I’m in heavy avoidance mode of literally everything but I’m constantly anxious and constantly not feeling well."
yes,shit I been needing that human interaction
yes,always anxious..it's like something is crawling over my body all the time
yes,"im constantly scared of literally everything, i cant leave the house but also cant be home alone because i panic either way. ...im always on high alert and constantly scared of the next thing thatll happen and im so sick of it."
yes,I'm so afraid being around people
yes,I've been feeling very anxious. I hate feeling like I'm dreading being there with my boy when he's the one having all the actual unpleasant things happening to him.
yes,I do unfortunately
yes,it feels like they are always staring at me
yes,i hate people looking at me and being like the center of attention.
no,Everyday
no,Hell yes
yes,I used to fantasize about making a device that would let me be invisible outside until I got wherever I was going.
yes,I dont go out ughhh 😢
yes,It makes me so uncomfortable I want to erase my memory from their minds
yes,I cannot stand being looked at. I wish I were invisible. I sometimes wear sun glasses or a cap just to hide.
yes,I have agoraphobia because of social anxiety and avoidance. Some people have looked at me with a smirk which made me feel I’m in danger and self conscious and just worse about myself. I still see their sinister stares when I close my eyes sometimes. Some have looked at me with an angry expression which I don’t understand because I didn’t even know those people.
yes,"I know, logically, that people don't give a shit about me and even if I catch their notice momentarily, that it's just that, and that they don't matter even if they *are* judging me. But it's so ingrained in the back of my head that even catching someone looking at me or thinking they are is enough to send me spiraling."
yes,"I have social anxiety, & do feel very self conscious when people’s attention is on me. I have felt this way since early my early teens, I am in my early 30’s & still have these feelings."
yes,i don't go out
no,Absolutely
yes,My anxiety is more around the vastness of the universe and infiniteness in the skies above us
no,Same
no,I feel the same way
yes,I feel like...cannot bring myself to do it.
no,"It's gonna be different for everyone so this may not be helpful, but something that I've been doing that helps me is going out early in the morning (before the rest of my area is awake) for a walk. Some days I can only do a few minutes, some days closer to an hour.  Obviously it depends on what type of neighborhood your in whether this can be safely done or not"
yes,"No one in my family understands. Hell I don't even get it. I mean I know what it is and what needs to be done but it's just like, how, and why did I have to be cursed with it."
yes,I'm sorry your family doesn't understand. It's hard for most people to understand things that they don't have (especially mental illness).
no,Thank you so much. And this sub is what keeps me going most of the time for real.
yes,"I'm so scared of the anxiety symptoms. I fear my throat closing up, the tension and drop feeling in chest/stomach, feeling like I can't breathe in all the way, the clamminess, the hyperawareness of my body and scanning for exits, anxiety tics, gastro symptoms"
yes,"I never had a fear of driving far in my life, but did anyone else get worse after the pandemic?"
yes,I feel like a lot of time we negatively talk about our social anxiety and agoraphobia
yes,"I haven’t left my bedroom in 76 days... I relate sis. But I’ve asked myself the same questions, like why am I still here? It sucks feeling stuck. In the same place for too long!... I can be a bit down and out...Those days felt like a life sentence though!... I am, and very much so, and that’s why this song is so comforting."
yes,i just get so uncomfortable and feel 10x more unsafe being outside
no,I've just been for a walk and avoided open areas and things that trigger me and feel like I've regressed.
yes,"I was completely housebound. Now, I’m on my own on a bus to a city I barely know. My anxiety is a 9/10 and I just had a mild panic attack"
yes,I have not seen my friends in over a year due to agoraphobia and just not feeling well with my health issues. I find that I also experience anxiety when people outside of my family come to my house.
yes,"I am constantly worried about my stomach acting up, being stuck in a situation where I am unable to go to the restroom and generally worrying myself to death over these things."
yes,"I suffer quite a lot from agoraphobia...I still suffer, and sometimes I really lack support, and then I go to Reddit :)"
no,It's all about small steps :))
no,has anyone joined any virtual/in person supper groups that have helped them? if so would appreciate any resources! i’m in california if anyone knows any here
yes,my severe agoraphobia
yes,I got my panicked butt into the car and went there myself. ...I’m just trying to rush so I can go home and feel safe again.
yes,anxiety inducing thing for you
no,yes
yes,I get anxiety when driving. Especially around open space/fields. And also when stopping at traffic lights because my brain isnt occupied enough to keep the panic at bay.
yes,"I used to sit in my partners car in the driveway until I felt like I wasn't trapped. Months of frequent drives, before I was even comfortable being in the car to go somewhere specific. I still struggle with long drives, but they're manageable now. If I don't go for a drive for a while, I regress."
yes,anxiety
no,[deleted]
no,"If it takes you out of your comfort zone, yes."
no,"It doesn't need to count or not count within some arbitrarily designated concept termed ""exposure"" - the important thing is that it's getting out of the house and not stagnating, it's life experience. That's good enough. Keep on going and doing. Enjoy life!"
yes,"i’d start a timer and see how long i could last outside, then push that time when i felt comfortable. i still have my limits but i can last much longer now"
no,Most definitely. This is how I see the outside world right now. Baby steps.
yes,I get out at least once a day(I do skip days sometimes)
yes,I have PTSD and still struggle at times
no,It counts for me. I consider it a major victory when I am able to do it!
no,Of course. It's a way to experience the outside. Does having sex with a condom count as having sex ? Of course. Feeling protected is a good way to experience exposure
no,"Yes, I don't see why not :)"
yes,"I have severe car anxiety as I feel trapped, so I haven’t been able to sit in vehicles for over a year."
no,Absolutely.
no,Yes I think so!!!
yes,feel anxious
no,"Absolutely, yes!"
no,Yes
yes,anxiety inducing
no,Sure does!
no,Yes! I haven't made it out of the house yet! Great job!!!!
no,Yes it does
yes,it's not only being around people but it's also a problem if people just SEE me. It's overwhelming and painful.
yes,avoidance with...unless it's underground
no,It does in my book.
no,for sure. anything that gets you closer to what your trying to accomplish counts as exposure.
yes,I'm afraid to walk on busy streets. I drive places and park close to the door to avoid walking outside
yes,"If an outing is relaxed and enjoyable, that's going to do a person plenty of good. It will lower stress, counteract depression tendencies, and remind the person why the goal of recovery is a desirable goal in the first place."
yes,"Driving puts a person in a state where they are required to be alert, yet also much of it is routine, so then you end up with room for intrusive thoughts to rear their ugly heads."
no,I get this all the time
no,Can you dm bro I can relate on open space a lot
yes,the feeling of being stuck
yes,"I have a problem with being seen. The more I try to wrap my head around it all, I realize I don't even like to be noticed by animals. Weird! I simply don't like to be noticed, period."
yes,"drives in excess of 30+ minutes, especially in high traffic, sends me over the edge. The commute to work has crippled me as of late."
yes,i feel this so badly. if people perceive me i wanna cry
yes,"I feel as well that with this kind of 'dreading of the traffic lights and stopping', i'm teaching my brain to fear it more. I feel ... fullll of anxiety."
no,That’s wonderful! Hope you keep up the good work.
yes,"I just don't like to be seen, heard or speak"
yes,it's just hard to avoid once the fear subroutine gets to going
no,"Ya, usually movement of some kind helps. Maybe singing lol. Some poor sod pulls up at the traffic lights besides me and just sees me belting out a random song 😂 Sour candy sounds like a good idea tho. I might try that!"
no,"Singing is good because we have to breathe a little differently in order to sing. That could break the tight, shallow breathing cycle. I like Sour Dudes - they are rainbow gummy strips and I get them at the Dollar Tree."
yes,"I seem to be getting dizzy. Like if I go into Walmart, I’ll suddenly get like a wave of dizziness and I feel like I’ll pass out or something. Then I get super hot and usually panic and try to leave the store. Today I went thrifting at goodwill and felt so hot and dizzy I had to leave. It’s so frustrating and embarrassing."
yes,I already notice subtle improvements in my mood
yes,"Went grocery shopping for the first time in months, didn’t rush or panic and took my time. I really thought I was never going to go grocery shopping again."
yes,"I've had this for 6 months now. Before, I loved the outdoors...Then I got the panic attacks...and started being really scared of going out. But what really sucks now is the isolation...the mental chatter really drives me nuts. On top of it, im worrying about a loss of income, loneliness and of course, thoughts of going nuts."
yes,"I felt uncomfortable at first, due to my anxiety, but I refused to let my anxiety/agoraphobia prevent me from having a good time. My heart was already racing in the shower. I felt like I was going to pass out the second I got in my car—but I’ve felt like this before, this fear of impending doom—this fear of having a heart attack, and you know what always happens? Nothing."
yes,"I have suffered from agoraphobia for half my life. It’s been hard, it’s been good. It comes and goes in waves. Last year was bad, but I am slowly starting to feel better again. I tried explaining this to my parents... I am taking big steps, but this is a disappointment towards them... I’ve been having nightmares and am crying, I’m scared the pressure could get me off track. Yes, I do go to therapy, but what can I do here?"
yes,"I had a bit of an anxious stomach, I started to wonder if I looked nervous/suspicious, I let him look at my receipt, all was well, like I swear I’m not stealing my dude, I’m just really uncomfortable!"
yes,I always find myself taking myself waaay too seriously and I have to just take a moment and relax and remember that I need to loosen up.
yes,"I had a major panic attack that lead me to being housebound and I’m just now starting to go through my exposure therapy again. I can only drive on the street my house is on, and go on fifteen minute walks. I feel incredibly defeated."
yes,I haven't left the house in two years now because of my rapidly declining mental health. I feel like I'm unsightly and shouldn't be perceived by the world. I haven't been taking care of myself and everyone comments on how I've let myself go and I just don't want to experience that again because it will make my self loathing worse.
yes,"I was super panicked, I was still anxious, I've been struggling with agoraphobia especially this last year"
yes,I had no panic attacks because I was so focused but it was still scary bc I’m not the best at driving.
yes,"struggle to go wherever, whenever you wanted"
yes,I'm severely agoraphobic and was housebound for a long time. Today I even bought myself a little something. It felt soo incredibly good even though my anxiety still is there
yes,"I feel like the walls of this prison are closing in. I am so emotional lately and feel like I cannot beat it. I feel like my nervous system is too far gone to ever reach a point of normalcy again. Six years housebound and no light in sight. If anything, this year things have gotten worse."
yes,"I immediately went into panic at the thought!! ...I journaled about my worries and ended up going on a walk to a park nearby and back. On the walk back, I started to panic but made it back home."
yes,"it's in surrender; it's the way you paint a stroke on a canvas wanting it to cover the whole thing in blue all at once but only having to hold onto the faith that with repeated strokes and effort put in daily will the canvas be covered and some day you will be looking at the art you created; you let go and accept where you're at in the sense that yes, you do try and go do that thing- whatever it may be, driving to the store, walking to the park, even going to take a shower. the goal isn't to go do that thing and accomplish it without any symptoms. the goal is to go and try and do the thing, with your symptoms. and honoring where you're at today. because everyday will be different. some day's you'll get to the store– but you wont feel able to go inside. some days you will. both days you succeeded, because you tried. and yes that extends to tasks as small as getting out of bed to shower or getting the door to pick up the food you had delivered."
yes,"I’ve never been one to complete things, it’s just how I’ve always been... after the panic attack the day before, I think I get a pass since I still went out. I still have a long way to go but I know I am stronger than my anxiety and I can get my life back."
yes,i'm suffering a lot of dissociation i'm proud of myself that i pushed myself out my comfort zone
yes,At my absolute worst I was stuck all day on the same spot of the same couch just going in and out of naps trying to sleep the day away until my mom returned home from work. I experienced monophobia as well and did not want to be left alone. It wasn’t uncommon for me to wake up in a panic attack in the beginning. The symptom that started it all was depersonalization/derealization. It quickly spiraled into full blown agoraphobia.
yes,"I felt like I barely had the energy to speak and open my mouth. Every time i spoke i felt out of breath. I went to take a shower and started panicking got out and started hyperventilating, i laid on the bed and for the first time ever i had a strong shock feeling like electricity in my hands and feet for about 10 minutes it was terrifying"
no,"LETTSSS GO
Ok, I'm really excited right now. So if anyone saw my post from yesterday about how I failed to get to Walmart and get my stuff.  Well, today I was able to make it out there to buy what I needed and it went great. Also went through an additional big stoplight and that went great too! We made one more stop at the drive-thru before going home and I bought my family dinner.  What an awesome Saturday. And shout out to my mom who I love so much she is very supportive and seriously always has my back. Have a good rest of the weekend yall!"
yes,"it breaks my heart every time he hates himself for not being able to get out of the house so easily, for not being capable to go to the next town that we love so much, for not being in a position to provide for me…"
yes,"I had the full body shakes, holding my breath, crying and the dentist just keeps saying, 'Nothing to be scared of, you need to breathe,' and I'm thinking, yea I know this is just my norm."
yes,"I'm scared to be alone, especially with my daughter, it scares me so bad and I just don’t know what to do anymore"
yes,"I struggle to leave my house because of how uncomfortable I feel around people, and the physical symptoms it causes. Everytime I interact with a shop keeper, make eye contact with someone, or talk to a shop attendant or anything I feel the awkwardness bubbling up inside me and that I want to scream."
yes,"I am afraid of being worn out by social situations and not being able to leave, being in a place without a bathroom, or having to ask someone to use one (so on car/bus trips), and also being too anxious to function and being embarrassed by that."
yes,"i’d been dealing with panic attacks and “mild agoraphobia” since i was 17...i couldn’t hold down a job...i was in an emotionally abusive relationship...i had a completely mental break...i panicked so bad we called the ambulance from the car because i was sure i was dying...i was bed bound for two months...i couldn’t stay asleep for longer than a half hour at a time, i couldn’t step outside for fresh air...i was simultaneously begging for death and terrified that my panic attacks were killing me..."
yes,"I have one panic attack a day. It’s hard for me to leave my bedroom let alone my house. I try to leave my house each day, though."
yes,I feel so worn out every single time I go out. I don even have the energy to talk. My mind thumping when I talk litrally. And I feel pressure
yes,"I can't work a normal job, I can't attend the college I wanted or travel anywhere. I'm so behind other people my age and my future is looking bleak. The guilt of letting down people I love—I just know everyone is going to leave me eventually, and I feel so alone even though it's my own fault I am."
yes,"losing control, embarrassing myself having that trapped with no escape feeling"
yes,3 weeks ago I could hardly walk down my driveway...I have been really hard on myself the last few days but writing this down has helped me realize that this is really good progress I've been facing the fear and fighting like hell and I just need to keep on pushing.
yes,"I get sad and depressed in the mornings, because every day feels like the same. I wanna go places but I don’t really have the energy or the want to get ready and go somewhere."
no,For the better part of 10 years I’ve been housebound and thanks to my anxiety and stress my poor stomach and digestive system is pretty messed up to say the least. I don’t eat “meals” really but mostly eat small snacks through out the day.
yes,"After being housebound for 3 years, I’ve been feeling like life is passing me by and I’m losing so much time."
yes,"I did an exposure tonight and don’t get me wrong it was awful, I feel like I ran two miles after it’s over and it felt like it lasted forever"
yes,I feel this shame and embarrassment...I have a stable job and stuff which is great so it could be doable financially but I wouldn't be able to live there at the moment with the panic that comes from being alone.
no,"Ive recovered and you will too, feel free to ask anything"
yes,I’m very alone and isolated I have almost nobody aside from family
no,"Hi! I was wondering what therapy style worked best for you - CBT, psycho-dynamic, erickson…"
yes,"I got all the way home, about 10 minutes, with no music or audiobook, no purchase in hand, but I did use my headphone noise cancelling to help with the city sounds. I am really disappointed I couldn't do everything I wanted to do while out, but am so proud for leaving the house and going somewhere in person when I could have bought it online. I'm now exhausted from being outside for 40 minute but I achieved something, and that feels good."
yes,"I’m too embarrassed to tell them agoraphobia makes it so hard for me to find a job, and that I’m still financially dependent on my parents in my mid 20s."
yes,"I recently got a major surgery which has made me more housebound than usual, but even before that I was struggling with feelings of never wanting to leave the house/never wanting to see anyone other than an extremely select few, etc. I get extremely anxious at the thought of even picking up groceries or takeout and have been Instacarting and Doordashing more than I ought to. I also have been struggling with severe akathisia due to a bad reaction to a medication"
yes,I have panic attacks in public often
yes,"I have panic disorder with housebound agoraphobia, over the years I’ve done therapy and it helped but about 5yrs ago I had a stressful life event which caused me to become housebound again."
yes,"I was so close to not going because the anticipatory anxiety was awful, to the point I was almost physically sick at one point."
yes,"I'm a bit shaky now, but WHAAAAAT. So proud of myself right now"
yes,I posted a while ago that I was living abroad so now I'm back at my parents house and have no job. I obviously feel a bit crap about this. Then I had a really bad panic attack which has pushed me right back to being really anxious and agoraphobic.
yes,I'm too afraid to go home Bc I'm afraid something medically wrong will happen
yes,"I hate New Years because it triggers my anxiety and reminds me that I'm just wasting away, I'm tired of being miserable. I'm tired of being lonely. I'm sick to fucking death of it."
yes,"Whenever I go for a walk however if I get too far it feels like everything’s blurry unless I look at my phone. The derealization sets in, then my sinuses start hurting and I start ticking . It’s horrible . Also feel so sensitive ."
yes,"I've become agoraphobic. My panic attacks were always about needing to get home and what if I couldn't get home quick enough. I have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD). my brain just keeps telling me that I offer nothing to the world and my daughter would be better off without me, she's everything to me and I'm letting her down and it fucking kills me."
no,"I just wanted to post this as a motivation for others. I have found drive thrus stressful for a while; once you are in, you are kind of stuck until it’s your turn to leave. That being said, no matter how scared I was, I always forced myself to go in them. It was stressful for months. But finally I don’t care while I’m in them at all. I went from feeling panicked, to feeling nervous, to feeling bored. It took time and patience. But it worked. I have been applying this to several other aspects of my life as well, and have had a ton of success. For example, highways, malls, etc. Baby steps at first, but slowly by surely I’m getting less and less anxious."
yes,"I have been having the hardest time wanting to leave my house for anything. If I am out, I don’t feel uncomfortable or panicked or unsafe… but getting out is the issue. And even when I go out, I can’t be out for too long.. I just HAVE to go home as soon as possible."
yes,I left the house deliberately without my headphones to go to the supermarket today and didn't have a panic attack
yes,"I did get nauseous in the car on the way home. I ate a lot to compensate, which is usually the norm when I go out, I have car sickness. But this morning, I got blurry vision, headache and nausea. I vomited three times, took paracetamol for the headache, ate a banana, drink gatorade which I promptly puked. I thought I was dying."
yes,"Sometimes when I look at the sky it gives me anxiety, especially during the day. Just gigantic emptiness. It plays a role in my agoraphobia and dissociation."
yes,Got Agoraphobia a few years ago after a panic attack...my comfort circle has gotten smaller and smaller as the weeks go on...Went to the supermarket earlier today and it felt like I was having a damn heart attack or some shit...I'm starting to feel completely hopeless as if my condition is becoming ever more out of my control.
yes,"I'm stuck inside, festering and not going anywhere, literally this is my life, in one room in the house, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week"
yes,Right now i can barely go outside even for 30 minutes. Im too scared to even play basketball with friends 10 min away. Feel powerless again with the derealiztion
yes,"I was hospitalized due to an unrelated health issue and due to all the stress and anxiety/panic attacks, I started getting dizzy and it hasn’t gone away. I’m starting exposure therapy, my dad took me on a car ride today and I cried the whole time. I have tunnel vision and don’t want to leave."
yes,not been anywhere for over 2 years it feels so nice to just step into a shop
yes,I woke up panicking in the middle of the night and this morning about an hour ago . Not sure why. I’m afraid I’m gonna spiral or panic or have derealization and being alone during this scares me 😫😫 I feel so alone . Like I’m gonna be stuck.
yes,I'll be in a grocery store and feel anxious and suddenly just freeze. Almost like I'm paralyzed and don't know what to do.
yes,I don’t feel safe in my house. I cannot stop pacing. I don’t feel real. I’m terrified. Every task is difficult.
yes,intense feeling of dread when I think about passing the threshold of either door to my house. They will never feel the eyes of all neighbors on them while trying to take the garbage out. I hate being watched. I hate being stuck.
no,"I made a post in this subreddit around 5 months ago, i titled it “i am never going to recover”, i talked about my struggles and my doubt that i’ll ever be able to experience life normally. "
yes,"I stopped really leaving the house a year ago now... I get very physical panic sensations (jelly legs, heart symptoms, head symptoms etc), so it’s just a shit experience overall. I experience panic symptoms 24/7 - they’re obviously worse when doing exposure."
yes,"i feel so incredibly pathetic surrounding my mental health but i am genuinely on the verge of killing myself... i have had severe anxiety my entire life... i began to struggle with panic disorder and agoraphobia... i stopped going to restaurants or anything where food is the main focus because it’d trigger me... i stopped going anywhere too far from home in case i panicked and felt sick and needed to go home... eventually, i stopped hanging out with friends or family because i was embarrassed of how anxious i got doing literally anything... my anxiety and agoraphobia have officially ruined every single good thing i have in my life and i feel ashamed... i feel like i will never be able to get better and I’ve honestly just given up at this point. i don’t know how i will ever be able to drive, have a job, move out on my own. i’m in therapy and i’ve been on countless medications at this point. nothing has helped me. i am turning 18 in a few days and i’m tired of being alive. i don’t know if i can continue on like this."
no,"How is it possible to date, and find your special person with this shit? Anyone have advice? I’m (20M) from Montana btw if my wife is reading this😂"
yes,"i have to take a shower, do my hair and makeup and put an outfit on every day or i feel like i have no purpose or routine. i cant stand when i feel “unattractive” even at home but when i DO go out i obsess over how i look. going to the restroom every 30 min to make sure i look up to standard."
yes,I feel like the combination of the pandemic and then becoming agoraphobic I’ve just been the ultimate flake. I hold on to a lot of guilt because of it. ...my window of tolerance is still pretty small
yes,my anxiety got really bad about my heart. I have been driving the whole way before maybe 6-7 times before. But now my brain is convincing me I’ll have a seizure or heart attack or faint behind the wheel. And the fear has been making me really nervous this whole week.
no,"I have always dealt with agoraphobic tendencies, but just 5 months ago, I hit rock bottom. I couldn't leave the house, and I genuinely thought my life was over. The thought of getting on an elevator, plane, or anything that might cause panic was something I actively avoided. I felt useless, scared, and had to take a leave of absence from work because I could not go outside. Even though I got accepted into my master’s program, I was sure I would have to drop out because of the anxiety."
yes,"i’m afraid. i’m very sad, i really want to just step up on it and ride around my little town, but i just can’t. i’m not brave enough."
yes,"I just wasn’t up for it. ...I’m so beyond lucky to have a best friend that understands what I go through, and stands by my side regardless of the kinda day I’m having."
yes,"I have extreme anticipation anxiety, and I ruminate over every little thing that could go wrong."
yes,at some point I started feeling light headed and was afraid I might faint
yes,"I'm sitting outside on the front porch for the first time in a year and it's terrifying. I can't stop shaking. I'm kind of scared it's going to trigger a seizure for me. I live downstairs from my cousins and one of them just left for work, walking past me. My reaction to that was to yell, 'I'm sorry!!' at her. I can't figure out why I'm so scared to be out here right now on such a gorgeous morning. I'm finally doing it yet I'm regretting every single second. Now I'm terrified to try to stand up for some reason. I can't figure this out."
yes,"I sat in the driveway for 10 minutes, went back in to grab my ice cubes (calms me to hold them). Got back in the car and said “fuck it, let’s go” and didn’t look back. I accepted that anxiety would be there but I would keep going."
yes,I have been an agoraphobic for about 2 years now. I was making small journeys but then I had to move house and I found that really challenging. I felt sick but when knew k was on the way home I felt a bit better lol. After I felt proud of myself and now I feel exhausted.
no,Need some goals and positivity for recovery today.
yes,Like childhood with family member that did very bad things with consequences for also me. Also everyday fighting at home and being the scapegoat.
yes,I find wearing my face mask helps with my anxiety and panic attacks heaps! It gives me a sense of comfort.
yes,"What helps me is people conveying that they will not be upset with me if I have to leave a venue for example and really following through on that, demonstrating that its my company they appreciate and wherever I am is where they want to be. Also being up for joining me on exposure activities is really helpful. Demonstrating a general easy going attitude and being patient and calm in the face of my anxiety is everything."
no,Taking medication? Getting a dog that your sibling can take for a walk.
yes,I have only dealt with agoraphobia for 2 years or so. So it was a really big shift for not only myself but my relationships. My sister is always very supportive and shows me that with the flakiness and avoidance that our relationship didn’t change. I feel as though with friends now that I’m trying to get back out there and say yes to plans I’m almost making up for lost time and trying to save face a lot. Not that my friends aren’t supportive but it’s just different? It’s easier to disappoint family sometimes(not that I want to).
yes,preparing what to do when someone has a panic attack
no,"Assure them that you'll be there for them no matter what happens. Helping with every single thing will drain you out...so tell them that you'll help with the big stuff - emergencies, bad days etc. Keep the relationship stable and balanced."
no,This is great advice.
yes,I am looking at a service dog.
yes,My sibling was bullied quite a bit when younger and the few people that my sibling dated decimated their confidence. My sibling was diagnosed with Social Pragmatic Disorder very late in life and there are not that many treatment options for adults.
yes,My sibling has a lot of panic attacks... intense fear of germs
no,You can accompany your sibling for a walk very early in the morning or at night.
no,Of course and thank you. I’m sorry that is the case for your sibling but it sounds as though you’re doing a great job! Your willingness to understand and support should go a long way. I’m sure they appreciate it 😊
yes,he yells at me multiple times each week to go to all of these places with him super far away and everytime I tell him I can’t because of the anxiety he says it’s all in my head and to just do it and get over it. It’s so invalidating and frustrating and he makes me feel even worse about this condition :( I’ve had panic attacks he yells at me during them
yes,I've thrown up and used the bathroom a million times from the anxiety of knowing I would be leaving. I'm completely covered in sweat at the thought of leaving the house and couldn't do it.
yes,I haven’t left my house in months
yes,I hate myself for being unable to function outside my home. ... I just feel useless. I've just become a big burden to everyone.
yes,"I’ve been able to keep my agoraphobia in check enough to take care of what I really, really need to do... But today I hung out with a friend for the first time in two years! I didn’t even realize until they left, but I’m really proud of myself for not making an excuse and just chatting with them over the phone instead."
yes,"I'm constantly worried about them, and what to do. ... I want a job that allows me to make occasional mistakes, and not let me feel like I screwed people over astronomically in doing so. ... I only worry about mistakes having colossal repercussions. Like, I don't want to be an annoyance, inconvenience, or otherwise negative effect, and by making mistakes like giving bad information while chatting with friends, forgetting an item in a store, not bringing enough money, etc, I feel like the time dedicated to whatever it is I initiated could have been better spent on anything else."
yes,i can’t get anything done outside of my house if my partner or my friend isnt with me
yes,Before you do exposure or have some thing coming up. We get anxious cause we have to leave the house etc or whatever you think your limits are. This is the anticipatory anxiety we all know about. But that also means we are already using the flight or fight cause in our subconscious minds we already experience that we go there etc. So we already are panicking beforehand.
yes,the brain can be such a burden
yes,"I’ve suffered from agoraphobia since I was about 14 years old. I go to work with my mom every day, which is very stressful for both of us. I can't stay at home because she is my safe person. when she goes somewhere without me, I start to panic very much, a panic attack begins, derealization, depersonalization, hysteria, etc. I'm very tired of living like this, my doctor can't help me anymore. I have no idea what to do. my mother is going to leave me with my grandmother tomorrow and go to work, but I know that I will immediately become hysterical, and my grandmother does not believe that I am suffering from something, also calling me a “pretender.”"
yes,"I got so lonely and isolated I had to change things. I started going on coffee runs, visiting friends, going inside of target… it’s amazing that the worst part is the in between the part where I’m thinking about what I have to do. Once I’m at the event or plans I’m actually enjoying myself and NOT anxious or terribly panicked!"
yes,"I was wishing I'd stayed home, but I did it to make my husband happy... The traffic nearly gave me a heart attack, the smells were awful, general sensory overload, and there were WAY too many people in a tight, cramped area... I was also extremely unsettled and kept being irritable to my husband... Outings like this make me never want to leave my house ever again."
yes,"I can drive and feel confident going the distance, I have driven 30 minutes or longer from my comfort zone so I know I can do this but I am struggling to fight up the willingness to do it. It’s about a 5 minute drive once I get on the highway to the other side once I can stop and in that time there is no option to turn around or take it slow I will just have to deal with the anxiety."
yes,I have major anxiety when it comes to leaving my house and I'm too depressed to leave too
yes,"I could barely leave my home and its immediate surroundings, so I’m still happy."
yes,I drove first and foremost after months of not driving. I drove to the store and went in and purchased items. I just hope it’s momentum not a passing thing. My motivation was it’s Father’s Day and I didn’t want my daughter to have to go do it alone and last second I just asked her if I could drive. It was a lot of impulse but glad I got it done. 😀
yes,"haven’t been able to leave my house for 5-6 years due to severe anxiety, ended up developing Agoraphobia."
yes,"I wasn't feeling positive, or confident, but I took it step by step... I had a panic attack... I was really scared... I did have a bit of a flare up of panic, but I sat right through it and let it happen, and it passed!"
yes,"I had a huge panic attack about five minutes in and had to ask the cab driver to turn back. I feel so frustrated and isolated, and I'd like to try again but I feel too scared -- and I miss my friends so much. I feel so trapped, I'm 35 and just feeling so... stuck."
yes,Today i actually felt very anxious and almost got a panic attack while i did my little morning walk around the block. Constant anxiety and depressed feeling at home which scared me too.
yes,My biggest fear the past several years has been going to the grocery store... I finally did it. I went to Trader Joe’s... It was packed and at first I was stressed but once I got into picking out what I needed and browsing I was able to tune all of the other shoppers out.
yes,I stopped showing up due to my agoraphobia got really bad
yes,I had to use a public washroom and it didn’t go horribly...being alone in public (no matter how long) is a massive trigger for me
yes,"people on this forum are socially isolated, and deal with financial issues."
yes,you don't have the energy to go to two places today
yes,"This year makes ten years of agoraphobia and I’m fed up. I’m going back to therapy, seeing my doctor and determined to kick this. I’m starting meds today."
yes,I've been a GAD and Panid Disorder patient for almost 15 years...I can go out but only for few hundred meters (there are spots that are closer but make me panicky though)
yes,"I started screaming and crying in the street when I realized what was going on, having a full on panic attack. People were staring. I’m so hurt, I feel violated."
yes,I have left the house... The biggest challenge for me is the depersonalization. It causes such horrible brain fog and is honestly the thing that freaks me out the most and causes the most panic.
yes,"He had what I believe was a massive autistic burnout in 2020 just before the pandemic started, and he couldn’t attend school anymore. ... It used to be like living with a Vietnam war vet .. with hair trigger reactions to things like if his eggs were too runny .. Now he’s emotionally regulated all the time. ... He’s very sedentary and his physical health is suffering. ... He gets quite panicked at the thought of showing his face, or someone coming into our home, ..."
yes,I'm still struggling every single day & there's still really bad days where it's hard to leave the house
yes,"My stomach has been acting up all week, and tonight, I noticed panic beginning to rise about an hour and a half ago. It just kept building and building. Eventually I felt like I had to go to the bathroom. Once I got in there, my panic spiked hard... I have emetophobia as well, the fear of vomiting, and anytime my stomach doesn't feel right, my first thought is always, 'am I going to puke?'... I have had, many, many bad experiences with this stuff in public in the past. I'll be totally fine, having a good time, feeling well, then bam, stomach cramps, gotta find a bathroom immediately."
yes,"I've walked to the bus stop and then immediately turned around to go home. But today.. I did it! I didn't feel super anxious or have a panic attack, even though I got off at the wrong stop both times and had to walk almost a mile in the lovely 107 degree weather."
yes,I started having a panic attack and it made me absolutely terrified to go back to the beach now with all these bees!
yes,I’m petrified of trying something new and cross tapering and side effects. My heart races 160bpm just laying in bed and I burn up for no reason. I can’t even take care of myself and have a good relaxed time at home half the time let alone exposure which is a nightmare.
yes,I normally don't get many tattoos because of the anxiety.
yes,"I've been agoraphobic since the age of 14/15 as a result of the Pandemic and my life has sort of been on pause ever since then. I haven't been able to learn to drive, I haven't been able to get a job, and I haven't been able to apply to college. I want so badly to be able to get on with my life. Ive lost all my teen years to this anxiety, and I don't want it to take my early adult life either."
yes,I could barely talk I was so anxious… but I managed!
no,"I went out. I went to my local bar. I played pool with friends. I had a beer. We even went to another bar and hungout on the patio there. Im elated. Relieved. I never thought I’d be able to do this. I said fuck it, and went forward and didn’t look back. I just wanted to share before I go to sleep. 🥰"
yes,I've been couped up in my bedroom barely able to leave and talk to my parents
yes,I've been so terrified to do laundry for me and my 2 kids. It had piled up so badly
yes,5 months back i had my first and only panic attack till date. After that trauma i found it really difgicult to go outside alone also had many anxiety symptoms at its peak for 2-3 months that started fading away.
yes,"I haven't been out for a drive in almost a month, I struggle being home alone, but I also start to panic knowing when anyone other than my girlfriend is coming over now too. I have had frequent spells of almost panic at night, and have been struggling with emetophobia as well, that triggers more panic. Like today, I was watching this guy on YouTube who reviews food items, and he was talking about how he got food poisoning again recently, and it sent me into a spiral, and I feel like I'm fighting a panic attack off. Speaking of panic attacks, I can't even talk to anyone about it anymore, because simply just talking about what happened with one, is enough to spur on another."
yes,could barely leave the house two months ago without shortness of breath and feeling dizzy.
yes,"I was afraid to leave the house for so long, I don’t even drive and can’t walk to the bank because I’m afraid."

yes,"My adult son has it, a long with physical health issues. He hasn't seen any medical professionals or therapists in a few years now. He's sometimes open to seeing someone but then won't follow through with it."
yes,I went Friday evening and slept for 10 hours when I got home because I was so drained from being around people. I went out for a friend’s birthday recently and was completely disengaged and not present. I spent the entire time there wondering if I’d been there long enough to leave.
yes,Feeling 'trapped' and not being able to escape instantly and independently. I had to - but I always felt like the world was staring me down and I'd panic.
yes,I nearly had a mental breakdown right there while panicking... Sat on the curb outside basically weeping and going through my bag as I do when I get super anxious... Why does such a minor inconvenience have to be such a disaster for me? I'm exhaused.
yes,"I haven't seen my parents at their home for over 5 years and now I'm visiting... I finally had enough and the pain of staying the same outweighed the pain of going for it. I'm here, I'm alive and I'm okay."
yes,My agoraphobia started when I was drinking heavily... I just feel so broken. I don’t work anymore I spend most of my days at home and I’m making no real progress because I hate the summer and it just makes my anxiety symptoms worse...
yes,I’ve been suffering with a really bad stint of agoraphobia recently and today I finally got out the house and went on a small walk ! I felt panickyl and outside of my body but I did it :)
yes,"I rushed her to the emergency... 3 months of daily stress triggered homebound-level agoraphobia and I'm still trying to overcome this. ...I have anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and I'm a 'highly sensitive person' when someone gets sick I get sick too. ...I don't know how I'm going to handle this. Both this hospital stuff and having an aging parent. ...I'm different kind of traumatized about loved ones' health and death."
yes,I can't fucking do this shit anymore. I'm so tired of waking up and reliving the same day over and fucking over again. Most days I think about suicide. I think about how embracing the eternal unknown would be so much better than living one more day with my brain like this.
yes,"My heart rate hits 180 from slight anxiety, I feel trapped, I feel like I can’t breathe, I feel doom, I feel like the world is ending, I get so shaky and tingly."
yes,"Why is there no real, permanent cure for panic disorder that is the most common cause for agoraphobia that really and completely just makes the panic disorder vanish?"
yes,I was ok going out for 2 years after that although I still had insomnia and mild panic attacks. ... My agoraphobia was extremely bad this time. ... I even developed internal bleeding due to stress. ... I haven’t left the house again. I can’t even go to the nearby mall now as my agoraphobia seems to have worsened to the worst it’s ever been
no,"So today I finally left the house for the first time in ages. Aside from moving twice (5-10 mins from my original location) I haven't left my house for any reason since 2018. I thought I'd be stuck like this forever and that I'd never leave, BUT I LEFT TODAY AND MADE MULTIPLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS."
yes,i hadn't left my house on my own in weeks...i feel proud of myself. i really hope i can get out of the house more often. it's so scary but i miss the outside world and not being imprisoned by my own anxiety.
yes,I just want to sleep all the time. The only motivation I have is that my girlfriend of 6 years is struggling with me and my parents are not going to be around to help forever. But to think about it is overwhelming and I just want to close my eyes again.
yes,I have had agoraphobia since I was about 13 years old... I have also been diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression and recovered from Anorexia Nervosa in my 20s... I was doing quite well using exposure therapy although I had a panic attack most days and was vomiting from anxiety up to 10 times a day for years... I have moved interstate and am now fully work from home and have gone into full 'hermit mode'... I was incredibly anxious and on the verge of crying the whole time beforehand...
yes,I’ve been agoraphobic for nearly 10 years now. It got me thinking about some of the smaller things I miss about leaving the house.
yes,"fell out of constant communication, but came back together about 8 months ago in the middle of the worst of my agoraphobia. at first he would just come over and we'd hang out in my room and i finally opened up to him about everything i'd been going through."

no,EverQuest
no,"I WENT TO A RESTAURANT!!!! i went to a freaking restaurant with my family (6 people!) and didn't have to leave the table ONCE for a breath of air ! I STAYED THE WHOLE 2 HOURS OF THE DINNER !! i didn't have to leave early and i got to enjoy myself ! this is really really big for me ! it was even in the town next to my small town (about 15 mins away from my place) which i haven't been to in 8 MONTHS ! AND I STILL DID IT! still had a good bit of anxiety while leaving and when i first got there but once i started talking with my family and eating it all went away ! i am so proud of myself because 8 months ago i would have NEVER been able to do this. i'm finally starting to see my way out of this dark dark tunnel and it feels so refreshing . i'm still not ""healed"" for lack of better terms, but i am slowly starting to get somewhere with my recovery ! it feels so freeing and it really does make me feel on top of the world after stepping so so so far out of my comfort zone and actually achieving the exposure of it ! idk if that makes any sense im just so proud of myself and really rambling plus it's late and im super tired but i wanted to post and share this with y'all ! okay goodnight or good morning or good afternoon ! until next time ! byeeee ! (you can do it too i believe in you and im so proud of you)"
yes,I already stress about the travel and that i probably have issues sleeping tonight too.. i just hate traveling and being stuck in a car on the road. The travel part is the worst.
yes,"I feel like the more I expose myself to difficult situations, the worse it gets... Every time I experience that level of stress, it makes me hate doing things more and more. The more often I do stressful stuff, the more negatively I feel about those situations... I felt like I'd been through something traumatic. I lost the will to go anywhere at all. The whole experience feels like a nightmare."
yes,"My mind immediately goes to everything that could go wrong. What if I get sick? What if I'm nauseous? What if I need the toilet? What if my back problems start?  What if all this happens and I can't do anything about it? I need to be able to escape. When I'm with my parents I can make them stop or help me. But when I'm with others I can't. I don't want to become an inconvenience to them. ... I started to hyperventilate and my mother had to come see what was wrong with the car. ... I felt trapped. I was fiddling with the ends of my shirt to calm myself. ... The feeling just gets really bad to the point where I want to cry. But I hold it in. When I get like this, I can't focus on anything. ... The feeling in my chest just feels horrible and all I can do is sit and wait for it to be over. ... I can't leave the house without my mind going through that thought process. Even standing in a line can make it start, being alone in a shop, parked alone in the car not sure when my parents will return. ..."
yes,I love it when it’s cloudy or raining. I make the best progress during those days because I feel safe. Like a blanket is separating me from the scary universe.
yes,can’t go in so you sit there and make yourself mad
yes,"I’ve suffered with agoraphobia now ever since the pandemic hit, and have been really struggling to get on trains specifically... I’m also depressed in general, sometimes I don’t even bother getting out of bed, but when I do I feel really good about myself... I feel so embarrassed and sad. What felt like small victories now feels like shit. Like I’m lazy. I’m not trying hard enough. I just feel like giving up."
yes,if I stay home for more than couple days I would find it hard to eventually get back on my feet and leave the house
yes,"I started panicking before even getting onto the plane because I was already imagining how confined I’d be for 7 hours.. and so I started to tell myself “alright, panic if you want to. I’m not getting off the flight and I’m getting my ass to this holiday I’ve been looking forward to with my partner.”"
yes,I’m a little worried for myself in case a situation like this happens out of nowhere
no,"As a bit of backstory, I’ve been completely homebound for over a year because of agoraphobia. It’s the first time in my entire life something like this has happened so it has been extremely disheartening and I’ve found myself in some really dark places mentally."
yes,literally hellllla anxious
yes,"I've been dealing with pretty severe agoraphobia for ten years... I never go out alone... I'll wait for the elevator to be free so I don't have to stand awkwardly. I do feel genuine terror about the public... I have such low tolerance for distress and a core fear of people... I've had some very bad, unexpected interactions with strangers which had just solidified my need to be afraid... I'm so tired of being petrified but the things I am afraid of are quite real."
yes,I truly can’t remember the last time I’ve done this and enjoyed myself. I had a fun day walking around to different shops and going to the library and garden center. I even waited in a line to buy some bread!! I hate lines- that’s a huge trigger for me usually. I can’t believe I did that.
yes,"I'm wasting my life stuck in my bedroom doing nothing. I have no friends, no social life, can't work, can't do anything. I'm desperate to recover, I'm so lonely and depressed. My life is so sheltered, there were things i wanted to do. I'm stuck in my bedroom doing nothing, can't work, can't do anything."
yes,I said no and that I was having an anxiety attack... I have agoraphobia too.
yes,I’ve been terrified of brain tumours and seizures. ... I hold all my tension in my forehead and neck and this makes thought cycles worse. Feels like there’s a knot in my head and has for years ... So obsessed with this feeling I’m ticking and had to leave my job and can barely go past my road and it’s horrid cuz I thought I was past agoraphobia
yes,"I'm not sure where to go, what to do."
yes,I'm completely housebound... I feel like it would be so embarrassing to talk to them again after completely ignoring them for 3 years plus as I said just me being a complete failure would make it so much more embarrassing.
yes,"I’ve been struggling with panic disorder and agoraphobia ever since January. I get intense anxiety symptoms (dizziness, racing heart, sweating, dissociation, you name it) when I’m out in public."
yes,i'm nervous to go to the salon tho because what if i panic while i'm there? i have been doing okay with recovery i've concurred a few stores but this makes me super nervous. cause i cant just leave in the middle of a haircut if i get nervous .
yes,"i don’t know what to do and i don’t understand why this is happening , im having panic attacks everyday "
yes,my anxiety just can't take it
yes,I'm so tired and so lonely. No one in my life has even care to get me help. They wonder but no one cares enough to try. I'm so tired of being this way.
yes,I get panic attacks when I leave the house. I’m terrified.
yes,I had to take my kid to the doctor by myself today. I did it! I drove us there and made it through the appointment and stopped for ice cream. No one else understands why that is such a big deal but it is. It was unbelievably uncomfortable but I did not panic!
yes,"I'm scared to go too far from home, even for stuff I wanna do, like see live shows again; what if I have a health episode and have to drive myself like that? I have conditions associated with increased seizure risk; what if I get one someday behind the wheel? I think of all the stuff that could go wrong with my health and I'm like, I want to go out and be fun-loving like before, but how do I know it's safe?"
yes,"I thought the world would flip upside down, and I would feel anxious to be outside without holding onto something... I get panic attacks whenever I have to walk across the huge parking lot... I only feel this way when the sky is clear."
no,"Granted it was just in a circle in a park, with no other people or cars, just my mom in the passenger side---but **I DID IT**!!! And I wasn't that anxious either. I had to stop once but I started up again shortly, and I was fine...even felt comfy enough to look around a bit! It was also bright and sunny out which in the past has been a trigger (and still can on bad days) **BUT** I am sharing this with you all because I drove in 2 circles and then on a short uphill road to park....I was sooo elated from this experience!!! It was like my mom and I had this whole park to ourselves for a bit....it is a local nature preserve....I was sooo relieved to be out in nature....focusing on all the trees and dragonflies....I even got to touch one before it buzzed away! I can't believe 2 years ago, I was housebound and couldn't hardly walk anywhere....**NOW** I am getting back out into living!!!! YES!!!! I still have some hurdles to overcome but **I have hope!!!** WE GOT THIS PEOPLE!!! RECOVERY **IS** POSSIBLE!!! I am here for any of you that need encouragement, just give me a hollar and I'll be there!!!! :)"
yes,"I was tense & hypervigilant the whole time... spiking fear... full blown panic attack... agoraphobia stems from emetophobia... phantom nausea... immediate jaw clench... dizziness, derealization... caveman fight or flight instincts... physical touch is my coping mechanism... panic attacks every time we’ve gone out recently"
yes,I feel kinda a setback... Like my subconscious saying im afraid and i shouldnt go out again. ...i get the feeling that im not capable of something i know i did 100 times already? Its like when i come home from exposure day after my agoraphobia says stay inside
yes,I have been a long time nicotine user and have noticed that my panic attacks and agoraphobia increase greatly with my nicotine use.
yes,"I have trouble now even getting up sometimes to do chores, cook food, etc., much less go out in public and not have somewhere I can sit when I feel lightheaded. ... It feels like a never ending cycle. ... I keep telling myself I can get through it, but the root of my anxiety keeps telling me I’m going to pass out and need to go home anyway, worsening my agoraphobia and proving my anxiety correct that I can’t go out even to seek medical attention."
yes,tried to feel all the emotions and allowed myself to feel them... my agoraphobia is slowly going away. Now i still need to find the strength to get over my health anxiety.
yes,I have a very hard time with my kids leaving me... I freaked out and wouldn't let him take our kids. I feel like such a POS. I feel horrible. Why can't I just be normal??
yes,"I was totally house bound, and now I walked 15 min to the doctor."
yes,I turned to drinking due to my agoraphobia and terrible psoriasis. I finally went to the doctor. Got labs and my liver and spleen are a mess. I have cirrhosis of the liver and I’m 35. I self medicated.
yes,I often find an intense feeling of overwhelm to be the main reason I want to leave places... I usually feel deeply overwhelm and I often need to go home so I can gather my energy away from things... I tell myself I want to see people but I think deep down I don't want to see people because of the overwhelm feelings.
yes,I only leave the house for necessities.. I want connection with other ppl but that terrifies me at the same time. Pretty sure I’ll be fully homebound soon.. I’m pretty scared ngl
yes,Today I went to the dentist for the first time since I got agoraphobia in 2012! I felt so disoriented and unreal...
yes,I fell pregnant with my second son in early May of last year. For some reason this spiked my agoraphobia. I’d have panic attacks at my ultrasounds and NST’s. After I birthed my son the anxiety came creeping back in. I tried to fight it off on my own for a few months but eventually caved and started the Lexapro again.
yes,A man in high vis is walking on the other side of the road which would usually stress me out but I'm doing it! ... Nerves increased a little but all good.
yes,"i've had 2 panic attacks just thinking about it. we planned on going tomorrow but i cry at the thought of it, mostly because im scared ill have a panic attack in the middle of it and ruin the night. im super scared and i dont know what to do to help myself"
yes,I felt nauseated and derealized and dizzy. I immediately start to feel depressed and embarrassed after this happens.
yes,i was avoiding restaurants at all costs...WITH NO ANXIETY AT ALL!!!!!! i feel more than proud and so greatful to be able to enjoy...and not have this horrid phobia and anxiety take one more experience from me!!
no,"I am happy to report that I went to the store for the first time in five months. I have gotten in the car several times, gotten onto the road, and even been in the parking lot, but I haven’t been able to go in. Well, today changed that. ..."
yes,I'm uncomfortable even leaving my bedroom to use the bathroom. I end up holding it until I'm in severe pain. Even changing positions in bed causing me anxiety. I wish I would just die. At this point I resent my family for making me feel too guilty to end my life. Making me hate the world around me even more. I just want my life to end.
yes,"i had agoraphobia for approximately 2 and a half years because of a traumatic event that had happened in late 2020. My agoraphobia was based on my fear of feeling ill when i am outside, at the time i felt like staying home was my best bet because if i felt sick then i would have all the remedies i need."
yes,i haven’t left my apartment for anything else but meds / keeping up appearances in about a year and a half. yesterday i came back into my apt after going downstairs actually crying and shaking from panic.
yes,I couldn't go further than a mile away from home. I almost talked myself out of it and I felt panicky at the start
yes,I actually went to my friends house and hung out for about an hour
yes,I WAS IN THE WIATING ROOM FOR LIKE AN 1HR N A HALF!
no,"Hey everyone, 
I wanted to share a win…I went on holiday to a country in Europe for just a few days and I just got back yesterday, I can’t believe it as I was honestly thinking of not going a few days before. As I kept not going to certain places due to panic. But I was determined to go on this trip. I hadn’t been on a plane for 3 years so I thought I’d freak out but I was totally fine on all flights. I did make sure to take Floridax before I left and another day on my trip (it’s a vitamin/supplement which has a combination of fruits/magnesium/iron/&vitamin B). I decided to turn my fear into excitement as I didn’t want to miss out. I would dwell on why this was an exciting idea and I ended up having the best time. I went to the beach, I went to different shopping malls, I went for walks around the area, I went to the pool, we went to (indoor and outdoor) restaurants etc. I did skip a couple of short walks with my family as I didn’t know if I could do it but I was able to do 90% of the rest of the things that we set out to do. 
I wanted to share this win as you can do it too! Anything you put your mind to you can achieve. Keep believing."
yes,"Last year I didn't make it because of agoraphobia, I got there and stayed in the car because I wasn't brave enough to go inside. ... I got anxious, started shaking. Then I took my Clonazepam and in a few minutes I was chilled and relaxed."
no,How are you today?
yes,Very very nervous but I know I’m capable to start
yes,"I managed my anxiety telling myself “body, why are you nervous? I'm feeling fine, I like it here” and it worked"
yes,I have seen bad reviews of it being triggering for some people and some have described it as using large group awareness training. I’m sweating just typing this out. I know I just can’t do this.
yes,"Cried, panicked, and was so nauseous but I still did it."
yes,"I suffer from panic attacks and the only way I can leave home alone is with the car. I took my bike, and walked to her studio. Yes! I discovered I’m confident walking with my bike on the sidewalk than walking alone or biking. The bike gives me a feeling of security and protection. So I did it! On the way to therapy and on the way back home. Without any panic attack!"
yes,I begin to sweat heavily and become extremely irritable and then I have a meltdown from feeling overwhelmed. I only feel safe being in my quiet room.
no,"Today I went to therapy, and went to a pet store by myself!! And had minimal anxiety!! No panic!!"
yes,I felt I needed it for support just to stand up straight.
yes,I’ve struggled more with monophobia than agoraphobia. I am terrified of being alone in my house or driving alone. I have a health condition that has scared me into thinking that something will happen to me when I am alone and nobody will get to me in time. It has caused panic disorder in me and has kept me from putting myself in situations where I can possibly have panic attacks.
yes,I had a major anxiety attack and spent the morning crying...I don't want to open the door. I don't want to interact.  I don't want to meet or talk to this new person.
yes,"Doubting if I should cancel or go. Don't feel I can make this trip at this moment. On the other hand, can't remember not one holiday I was not scared to death to leave. But energy levels are low this time and noticing a tendency towards depressive thoughts recently because of decades of agoraphobia combined with family issues and pressure."
yes,"You would start by opening the front door and just standing there and staring outside . You would let the panic happen and just let it pass until the panic subsides. The next day, you push the goal a little bit further. Walking outside. Then the next day walk to the mailbox, so on and so forth."
yes,I couldn't leave my house much a year ago. I constantly go out now - I even went out of state for a week. Somewhere new I've never been.
yes,Baby baby steps. And make sure you've completely conquered the first step before you take the next.
no,"you could google ""agoraphobia recovery reddit"" and some posts will pop up with answers already under them. or just scroll this thread there's lots of advice under the posts."
yes,"you get panicked and run home, that’s really only reinforcing the anxiety and agoraphobia"
yes,I am so scared
yes,"he's agoraphobia, especially after an incident where he passed out... He doesn't wanna stay home... he also is upset about going to the party"
yes,"when i am walking, all i can think about is how long it’ll take for me to get home and how horrible it’ll feel with my symptoms... when my symptoms show up i tend to freeze and have a really difficult time moving at all, so when i’m on a walk it’s really scary because I either have to move or be stuck away from my safe place"
yes,"I developed agrophobia due to having a dissociation and obviously anxiety disorder. And I walked down my driveway today and got the mail . It may seem dumb to others, however I haven’t left the house in months and was afraid to go down to the mailbox because I’m afraid of feeling like “things are not real”. So it’s an accomplishment to me."
yes,i’ve been suffering real bad with anxiety/ agoraphobia for around the last year + depression for a few years
yes,"I usually only leave my house for doctor appointments and to see my family. Even then, it is a huge challenge."
yes,I really can’t wait to go home already
yes,"I did it, I got dressed, left my house, kept my breathing relaxed, and I drove in traffic 6.5 miles to my doctors office. No panic, no anxiety, no 'What iffing'"
yes,"I ended up highly anxious about eventually having to go out, to the point that I hadn't even taken my covid vaccine. Felt a little anxious on the way but no full blown anxiety attack, unlike how I catastrohphised it in my mind during the days leading up to the appointment. I had anxiety around taking the vaccine too, but it's been about 2 hours since the shot and I feel ok! Still a little anxious about side effects, but otherwise ok!"
no,Hi all just thanks for even being a thing online
yes,it’s been really hard lately just to even go get food and be with my friends
yes,I’ve been developing this fear of being in the car/train or going to any store/restaurant since surgery. I’m like scared to develop nausea again and possibly throw up in a public place. I literally get this choking feeling every time I’m sitting in the car as it moves. I also had a panic attack today from just the thought of having to travel an hour to a drs appointment for a shot.
yes,I bet I have the longest non-vomit streak of anyone on here.
yes,"I get extremely panicky when it's over 75 and sunny, feeling hot outdoors sends me into a panic about heatstroke and it means in the summer I basically live like a vampire and only go out to run errands on cool nights."
yes,I developed agoraphobia this past year... I was terrified to go to work and was so anxious even at my apartment. I stopped going to class and eventually quit my job because I kept calling out. I started going home every weekend and when I’d have to come back I was horrified... I know that I was doing avoidance behaviors... It’s been so hard everyday. I wish I was never like this and never had to go through all this. I think part of those months were traumatizing to me and it still sticks with me now.
yes,"I stopped myself. I stayed inside my house and I refused to look for work, I dropped out of school twice. But I started a job last week."
yes,I've been struggling with derealization for the past 2 months after a traumatic panic attack in the car and so in return my brain thinks cars are not safe.
no,"Hello everyone,
I hope this will inspire someone out there.
So i was homebound previously for 2-3 years and have been practicing gradual exposure for 6 months now. I needed a job since long but wasn't able to attend interviews.
Today i finally decided this is it, if i want to have a career i have to do it and went for an interview about 5 kms away.
I was jittery and was having intrusive thoughts but i did it gave almost an hour long interview and did well. I did have moments when i was panicking and was thinking of going back. Funny thing is i couldn't print my CV due to this and went back and said sorry.
But all in all this is a success story! Also, i would like to hear from people who are working full-time for inspiration.

Things that helped me:
1. Spirituality
2.Having a goal/purpose
3. Affirmations like i can do it! 
4. Having a cab/auto waiting out
would enlist more if i remember anything else! :)"
yes,feel severe dread every time I have to go out somewhere
yes,"I've become agoraphobic after a string of traumatic events in recent years. I'm dreading picking it up later. I managed for a few years and thought I was making huge progress, then last October I lost my job and haven't been able to find one since... Sometimes I feel like I can conquer the world. But those days are increasingly infrequent. I don't want to become a complete shut in but I'm really worried it's too late for me. I feel like this monster is defeating me."
no,"Me! Its been around 5 years since I've travelled :( but one of my goals this year is to take a small vacation, even if its really short and really nearby"
yes,I am housebound practically. I dropped out of uni and live together with my boyfriend. I also can not work. Also I am unable to be alone due to my anxiety. This makes life tough.
yes,"Thinking about it gives me a sense of dread, as with other people in the car i feel like i wont have an escape and can see myself already getting sick due to the nerves. Not only that but when we get there, i don’t think there will be a room I can be alone in or escape to whenever i need it so that’s only increasing my fear around it."
yes,"I've had it for around 10 years now, was unable to finish high school because of it, and i'm still living at home. I don't really know what to do because I can't figure out a way to make money"
yes,I do it so much that it feels weird when I’m not doing it. I know im making it so much worse for myself but I just get so bored and lonely when I’m not online
no,I’m really proud of myself and feel like I made a major step forward
yes,walking around my neighborhood alone always feels the scariest to me
yes,Just getting there is making me sick to my stomach and I barely slept. I wish I were further along in my recovery journey.
yes,I do not need to fear the panick attack and also really experience the panick
yes,"I have been living with a panic disorder and agoraphobia for 10+ years, but in the last 3, it has become so intense that I rarely leave my house and it has just destroyed me. ... I have a doctors appointment today and I always wake up 2 hours before the appointment, take my meds about 1.5 hours until, and then I am just non-verbal for the entirety of the appointment and my spouse does all the talking, and i just use my noise cancelling headphones to keep things peaceful in a way that i can control, instead of feeling out of control. ... Update: I got to the doctors office and then had a panic attack+ started crying, and two nurses came and talked to me like i was a danger to myself or something when i was just scared and anxious and embarrassed."
yes,"When I want to poop I have anxiety, and when I have anxiety, I want to poop. It messed me up so badly, that before even going out for 5 minutes, I have to be sure to go to the toilet and stay there at least 20 minutes. And sometimes I go there like 7-10 times a day."
yes,"I'm so damn tired of this shit, I wish I could just pull the agoraphobia off of me like a bodysuit and put it in the trash and burn it."
yes,"I’ve been Inside for 6 years, My wife of 7 years and two children left me, in huge part to my agoraphobia not “improving quickly” enough... I spend my days staring out the window and hoping I just fall asleep and don’t wake up so I don’t have to deal with this anymore"
yes,"By day 2 I was going mad without electricity, lost all my groceries, and needed the internet to contact my LDR partner. ... I'm still nervous about travel and dread going out sometimes"
yes,get excited for the vacation to be over
yes,I feel so isolated from this condition since i’m unable to socialise with others in person and don’t have many to talk to online.
yes,I felt really overwhelmed! 
yes,I've unfortunately experienced a lot of trauma and have also started to work on healing my past traumas during these past few years. I’m usually able to go out with my loved ones but even then I’m usually anxious or on edge.
yes,I haven't left my house in years... I don't have insurance for meds or anything... I got white coat syndrome as well... I'm getting nervous about having to return home. I can't stay here too many people as is.
yes,I have a wardrobe of unworn clothes and cool sneakers that are gathering dust and I’m just ITCHING to wear them in public. Before this phobia I used to wear quite cool and adventurous outfits and would constantly get compliments on my style which was fun. Now that part of me is completely nonexistent and I do really miss it.
yes,"Some anxiety on the way but I made it there and had a bagel! The bus on the way back was the worst bit though, it was packed, I was stuck at the back and traffic was bad. Had a moment of panic but it passed quite quickly and I became exhausted."
yes,"I’ve been suffering with what I have self diagnosed as agoraphobia for about a year and a half. I had just started a new onsite job after working remotely for about 5 years. It was a change for me, and that’s when my panic attacks started. My third day on the job I had my husband pick me up, and basically lost my job after several days of calling out. From there it escalated to panic attacks while driving, while going to supermarkets, and going to restaurants. I was constantly dizzy. I’m a bit of a hypochondriac so I was also suddenly more aware of every sensation or pain in my body, and it would send me into a full blown panic attack. I still experience it, especially when my anxiety spikes. As for my agoraphobia, some days are better than others. On good days I’m able to take 20 minute walks in my neighborhood, or drive my car 5 minutes down the road, but haven’t really done anything more than that. I still can’t drive longer distances, go to grocery stores, or restaurants. I feel so much shame and guilt. I’ve missed out on so much in this past year, and I’m so frustrated and angry with myself."
yes,I'm terrified to drive use social media talk on the phone to anyone but my parents or therapist and have no friends except 2 cousins I rarely talk to. I feel like a child and tend to get treated that way too; I'm afraid of everything and nothing is going to ever change except I will be older and even more alone. I'm seeing a therapist but I feel so helpless!
yes,I always need one of my friends or family members to come with me into any public environment or I completely shut down and start having a panic attack.
yes,if u force yourself into emotionally unsafe situations you will only make your agoraphobia worse
yes,i'm fucking terrified of even thinking of going to the hospital. let alone the emotional fall out of the actual surgery.

yes,"I feel exposed, under a huge magnifying glass like a bug."
yes,"A few years ago I began having panic attacks while driving and then while at the grocery, in restaurants, and pretty much everywhere outside of my home, and now I can barely leave my home unless it is for an occasional medical appointment, or to walk around the block. My symptoms when leaving my bubble are flight or fight, I will feel death is approaching. It terrifies me. Racing heartbeat, breathlessness, numb limbs, it feels like a bad acid trip. Over and over."
yes,hated opening my blinds and would shut myself in my bedroom for an extremely long time
yes,I haven't left my house once in almost 4 years... My fear is I'll make it to my parents 2 hours away and completely lose my stuff.
yes,"I cant shake is the rational and irrational thoughts that play in my head all day... I think of workplace shootings, my evacuation plans, rape and murder in the elevators and stairwells. Then, my brain goes full fictional and people's faces start to look weird and menacing. I get chest pains, headaches, sudden dizzy spells and have thrown up."
yes,"I started getting thoughts like oh shit I'm gonna fall over and I'm gonna pass out...and then I let the panic wash all over me and stopped every resistance I had to it. My heart immediately started racing and I got that familiar feeling of ""I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW"" and I started to walk faster and scratching my neck."
yes,anxiety will suddenly rise and I'm thinking holy shit I need to go home. Then about 5-10 seconds later I get over it. I might still be a little anxious afterwards but I'll be fine afterwards.
no,i’ve almost fully healed and i’m finally going to be making money and driving! i’m so excited:)
yes,I can barely get out of bed without feeling anxious
yes,I felt like I was about to have a panic attack the entire time
yes,my worst days are the sunny and bright days... Sometimes I feel like the darkness protects me whereas the sunlight keeps me exposed.
no,"I find asking how other people are doing, genuinely. Helps me find perspective and gratitude. So I just wanted to see how everyone was doing today? I don't have a lot of community. I am proud to call all of you community ♥️."
yes,i was really starting to freak out because there was someone else on the train car visibly freaking out but i did some tapping to keep myself grounded. i was very close to having a panic attack.
yes,I've been terrified to leave the house for so long...I was scared and had a panic attack

yes,I DREAD going outside in fear of really bad pain/nausea.
yes,I haven’t left my house in 6 years and prior to that I could barely handle work until it got so bad I just retired early. It’s just so lonely.
yes,I'm waiting on a call back they said I might need to go to hospital but I dont think I can because of my agoraphobia/anxiety:( 
yes,I felt nervous all day yesterday and through this morning... Some digestive upset... fear of getting sick that's a major trigger for me. I had anticipation and anxiety and dread...
yes,"I have my mother, who doesnt quite understand my anxiety and what I need when we're out of the house together. I inform her of the facts and she says she wants to help me, but when it comes to supporting, she's not very helpful - which can make my anxiety worse."
yes,I tried 3 separate times to do this fucking cab ride and every time the panic got so bad I had to turn around. And I feel this horrible combination of shame and rage at him for not just picking me the fuck up. And grief for a normal life.
yes,"I was super scared beforehand...what if rehearsals have been fine so far but once I get on the stage I'm gonna panic and it'll just be a panic attack every time I do it...I have had several moments on stage where my mind goes 'holy shit I'm on stage in front of 350 people, I'm supposed to be agoraphobic, what in the WORLD AM I DOING'"
no,"I posted here earlier today about not being able to go to a cosplay convention I was really looking forward to. I got some advice, both from here and from my therapist, telling me to take it slow and at least go to the hotel. I made it to the hotel! It was my longest car ride in a very long time but I MADE IT and I’m so proud. Thank you for all the support and advice! Next step is actually getting out on the con floor tomorrow…"
yes,"Ive been completely housebound for many years, scared id never be able to have a normal life again"
yes,"Driving at night used to scare me, driving after rain used to scare me, talking to the attendant at the service station used to scare me."
yes,"I sat through my first public panic attack without reacting... There was mild tremors after, but they faded too... Sat at a restaurant and ordered food...and the urge to leave was so strong. I couldn't remember the DARE response, but i remembered the 'do nothing' principle...and i did nothing! It passed in like less than 5 min. Legs were a bit jelly, but that went away in another 5."
yes,"Then one day, I just couldn't handle the grocery store. And then I couldn't handle going to friends houses. And then I couldn't handle work or driving. It just snuck up on me."
yes,"I've been diagnosed with agoraphobia more than 3 years ago and been housebound for a year. I found that exposure therapy even though it's relatively new has high effectiveness rates for agoraphobic symptoms. I started small, like not running out of subway when I felt a panic attack incoming or not leaving the store when I felt I was about to faint. Instead I focused on breathing and kept telling myself that everything is in my head. I also found that talking to people helped overcome these symptoms. The trip was scary, I had multiple panic attacks (especially on the plane), was dissociated half of the time but managed to get through."
yes,"i was panicky at first, i feel very nauseous whenever i fast and i was scared of going out. ... i didn’t panic at all when i was out!! i cant believe this since last time i went out i was a nervous wreck"
yes,"i feel like im not real, im filled with panic and terror, its too bright. i dont think i’ll ever be able to recover. im so upset and anxious and frustrated, i want nothing more than to go home. i want to go home where im safe."
yes,I have struggled to leave my house alone...my radius is very small and my time away is short. I typically stick to driving around the neighborhood so I’m 30 seconds from home.
yes,I just cant control my panic about it. I used to go to walmart and just talk to strangers about anything and everything and feel great but now literally going in my front yard spikes my anxiety. I hate who I am now.
yes,I was already more anxious than usual but felt like I could still manage it. I felt like I was somewhat present but I think I was dissociating a little bit. Like I was at a stop light that normally makes me panic but I didn't care and was in a good mood about it.
yes,"I always had severe social anxiety, but now I'm so scared of having a panic attack, throwing up or some other symptom, with no ways to escape. I feel so alone here. I'm like losing my mind."
no,A continuation to my previous post. I've been struggling with leaving my city in 6 years. Today I crossed the bridge I've been struggling to cross to suprise my girlfriend at work. I DID IT! And it feels amazing.
yes,I experienced a reawakening of the panic disorder that was dormant for nearly twenty years. I would suddenly get overwhelmed with a feeling of imminent doom. I became convinced that I was going to die of a sudden heart attack or stroke... I soon lost the ability to drive and after bouncing around from job to job I lost the ability to work. Following this I was awakening with daily panic attacks... I struggled to even have friends come to my house and not feel like I had to leave the room.
yes,feel completely exhausted...i’m having bad thoughts and just want to give up
yes,I'm always a lot more anxious.
yes,"I was 19 when I had my first panic attack, a panic attack so bad it felt like I was dying. After that I physically couldn’t leave my student accommodation, at least that’s how it felt. It was impossible for me to even take the 5 minute walk to the grocery store."
no,"How old are u?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1dw0aul)"
yes,I think it was too much exposure and it completely overwhelmed me to where I wouldn't leave the house for a couple days.
no,You can take it a little but at a time day by day and each day expose yourself some more. Before you go out just keep reminding yourself how great you’re going to feel and how proud of yourself you’ll feel afterwards :)
yes,i just worked through a terrible 5 hour panic attack
yes,doing things we feel anxious about
yes,"You will never 'get rid' of anxiety, you can only become more brave."
no,I’ve wondered this as well! I think writing down successes might be helpful. Imagine looking at a list of 50+ successes that you can read while driving or when you feel anxious. That might help with the negative thinking.
yes,"I do always get a little nervous whenever I have plans scedualed. ...my ocd is weird... Im only a little nervous about this because horror movies are louder and more intense then romcoms obvi, so i am a little nervous that that will make me anxious"
yes,I had a relationship currently end partly because I couldn't leave the house. I'm alone everyday and it's making me feel sad.
yes,"I've been agoraphobic for about 14 years now, I remember having my 18 birthday in the garage because I couldn't go a mile down the road. I started having daily panic attacks, waking up shaking, couldn't sleep all night my mind wouldn't stop racing... I still have a small radius, about 45 min from my house is all I can go or I start panicking... have phobias of taking medicine and barely can take Tylenol."
yes,on SSDI for their agoraphobia
yes,"The panic i feel at going out is very real.  Having a very bad bout at the moment.  I feel like if it was learned then i can unlearn it.  Its so hard to plan things, hard to have faith in my own abilities.  I feel so defeated."
yes,"I have/had some bad anxiety issues that culminated in me just not leaving my house for, uh, like six years. ... I'm sitting here at 31 grappling with things that most go through when they were in their early twenties, because they weren't hiding out in their room, thinking something awful was going to happen if they were out there alone."
yes,"I feel paralyzed. I have multiple mental illnesses, suicide attempts and chronic pain. Feel like I've fucked up so much at this point that no one would hire me with no work experience at this age."
no,"Wanted to share a quick success story. I started developing agoraphobia 9 years ago. I had 4 housebound years where I lost everything, called crisis lines, etc. To say it was bad would be an understatement. It was the darkest, most hopeless time of my life, and my life has been filled with depression, self-harm, and drug use, so that's saying something. I wrote goodbye letters to my family members. I essentially lost my 30's because of this."
yes,"I have agoraphobia, it’s a very touchy subject for me... Today, second time they come, the mom approaches my boyfriend and tells him I’m “always on the computer” and “I should just go outside for a walk, if I’m so depressed.”"
yes,I constantly cry like a baby with 0 confidence. ...I might have social anxiety. ...I'm having mixed emotions. ...It's sickening me to stay here be bored and lonely not being able to talk with anyone. ...I'm so hollow inside.
yes,"I have had debilitating anxiety for years off and on, can’t leave the house, obsessing over throwing up when i’m anxious it’s just awful. ... I literally was gagging and had to bring a bucket with me in the car like I just uncontrollably gag when I get anxious."
yes,"I usually panic and can't do it. I was fine the way there. After I was done with my errands I felt brave enough to try the bus totally on my own. I waited at the stop and started to get a bit fidgety. I did breathing exercises to help relax, and listened to my audiobook on my headphones."
yes,it made me feel like shit. I actually do have a job too. She’s so fucked up making fun of the fact that I have a severe mental Illness and she just doesn’t care.
yes,my hr will be so high and I feel it which increases the worry. Sometimes it even makes me feel dissociated or like crying once my hr increases.
yes,I have been in a state of freeze in my body and with therapy etc I still have not been able to heal... I have been living on edge and with serious agoraphobia since finding out that he is just steps away from my house... I had a severe panic attack and I kind of blacked out in the car and felt like I was there where he beat me again and it kept playing over and over and over again like a bad movie... I am in a constant state of distress... It is completely unhealthy for me and my unborn child and I'm worried about the effect this level of daily stress will have on my baby... I feel deeply suicidal because I feel I cannot escape my abuser being near me and I do live in fear of him showing up in the middle of the night etc.
yes,"I have had agoraphobia off and on since I was about 27. I’ve noticed the first outing of the day is absolutely unbearable for me. I have no idea why. It feels like any progress I made the day before in not being afraid of being outside, exposed, vulnerable, etc, was erased completely by sleep. I’m still scared to go out in public on the weekends. My brain is doing the whole “NO NO UNSAFE UNSAFE” but I get up and leave the house and go to work every morning and I’m going to the exact same area this morning except this time I’m going into a shop to browse around - something I used to love doing and agoraphobia stole. I already KNOW my mind and body will raise hell when I’m in the store. I expect that. My anxiety has never rewarded me for trying. The reward only comes after I’ve done it. But in the midst of the doing it’s LOUD and tries everything to get me back to go back to the car. I’ll even get near instant relief just turning the car around and heading home instead of keep driving toward the “unsafe” place."
yes,"i used to live a normal life shocks me so much because how did things get so bad? i'm currently in therapy, and i know that i'm making small progress, but the fear is just so big still."
yes,"I've had agoraphobia 10 years and 8 years was homebound... I've had CPTSD since I was at least in my early 20s but undiagnosed until 2 years ago. Eventually cptsd, intense traumas,  zero healthy coping skills, chronic high stress, no boundaries, high functioning, self medicating,  wouldn't admit a problem if I had to, a year of terrible psychosomatic symptoms and terror finally caught up to me."
yes,"I am together with my boyfriend, same age. Together my agoraphobia is less.. but trust me this is not easy.."
yes,I have been agoraphobic for around 7 months now after my first panic attack which led to an er trip and led to me developing health anxiety. I was still having panic attacks at home and outside...I went home early and I think this experience has made me fear going outside much more than before
yes,I get really bad anxiety and feel like I’m going to peep/poop my pants. I cant go to any big cities because I’m afraid theres no access to a bathroom. I start panicking and need to go. I cant even go out without constantly worrying about going to the bathroom and where/when I’ll be able to reach the next bathroom. I feel like my life is being ruined by my toilet anxiety
yes,"I am in full panic. Its almost to the point of going to the emergency room. I have been agoraphobic (especially related to work, new settings…) for a long time, and i am terrified of having a panic attack on monday."

yes,I still feel like if I panic in public people will judge me.

yes,"I was very nervous, almost succumbed to panic, but I was able to wait, and when the connection was restored, I exhaled. I didn’t take one step away from my safe person for over a year, but I did it. I was able to overcome myself and stay in a place that I did not consider safe."
yes,"my anxiety has been so bad that I refuse to go places or even take walks out of fear of having a panic attack and throwing up because of it. I would have to go M-F for three hours everyday, downtown, at a place I’ve never been before, alone without any family member, to talk about things I don’t want to think about, and to do things I’m so scared to do."
yes,"fear of fear, fear of judgment, fear of bodily functions out of your control... If you throw up, cry, faint or fucking shit yourself from fear it doesn’t matter."
yes,"A psychologist mentioned to me that some of the things I carry in my bag are safety items - they’re there purely to make me feel safe, or are things I can turn to if my anxiety creeps in."
yes,"I completely shut down when their agoraphobia gets bad... not talking to anyone, including family and friends, even your partner? I feel like it’s too overwhelming to talk to anyone and I know it upsets the people around me."
yes,I feel like they haven’t done MUCH and I’ve taken the klonopin on days I don’t even need them DESPERATELY but when I’m pre panicking and ehhh.
yes,"it was really really nice. I had a really nice night and not a single thing that my anxiety was worried about happened. No one had to call ems, I didn’t pass out walking up the stairs, my heart palpitations didn’t even happen."
yes,I'm absolutely terrified. I want a job so badly but not sure if Im even in the right place for it yet. And I really want the date to go well but also in the back of my head I'm thinking ok then what? I still can't go that far from home especially not without a safe person.
yes,"I have super controlling narcissistic parents who would go out of their way to embarrass me in public, constantly yell at me for how I was perceived in public, and would instill fears about me being kidnapped or hurt as soon as I would get the courage to leave the house."
yes,"I've been too afraid to get it the entire time it's been out, afraid that I might have a reaction to it (i have reaction trauma), or something bad might happen to me when i get it, like covid arm."
yes,"I am HORRIFIED of huge spaces. Can’t cross streets, fields, whatever. It scares me and I shake and cower when I do."
yes,"I’ve been struggling with agoraphobia and panic attacks since January. This year I’ve felt unable to drive, go anywhere alone, or socialize or date much. I’ve been overwhelmed by symptoms like racing heart, dizziness, nausea, and impending doom. Add that I have a fear of fainting and throwing up, and you can imagine how trapped I’ve felt when I get these symptoms and panic attacks."

yes,"I can’t drive, I can barely sit in a car without panicking, but home is my happy place. I have control here."
yes,"I seem to have the worst luck. I saw a transphobic sticker on a post, my favourite bag broke and I ran into someone I REALLY didn't wanna see."
yes,I have been confined to a specific radius to my house the entire time. My agoraphobia makes it to where i cannot travel specific distances to which i deem to far. I will get panic attacks and get uncomfortable about family members traveling far away from me.
yes,"I wouldn’t be agoraphobic, I wouldn’t be fat, I wouldn’t have CPTSD…. "
yes,"I have now gone into an establishment EVERY DAY this week. I have gone through drive thrus, drove to points in my city I said even a couple days ago I’d never be able to go to."
yes,I was a weird kid...an artist born into a family of college graduated accountants and engineers. I refused to go to school when I was 7...I slid into agoraphobia...My agoraphobia manifested itself mainly in stores and public places. I knew I had to get food but couldn't stand in lines at grocery stores...I still struggle with that and use the self-checkout lanes. I had NO CO-DEPENDENTS. That's my main point. When you have to deal with it on your own...you do.
yes,I was diagnosed with late onset PTSD. I had treatment for it but then 6 months later I started to have dissociative attacks and seizures. I spend a lot of time inside however in the last week I feel like I've been getting worse again even worse than before. The only place I feel safe is in my room. Even the rest of the house feels like a challenge and the outside world feels way to overwhelming and like if I push myself to go out I'll have another seizure.
yes,"i am absolutely shitting myself. i’ve been anxious and shaky and lightheaded all day, thinking about how people are coming from out of state to be crew and work on this film so i better not get anxious or fuck it up or be bad at my job, etc. etc. all the usual anxious thoughts."
yes,it feels kind of nuts to manage this. i can already tell i'm mentally exhausted.
yes,"I tried to fall asleep and it didn't happen. I got hungry and had a couple bowls of cereal. After which I quickly became anxious. Maybe it was the fact that I was tired and so my ability to control my anxiety was lower, I don't know, but I freaked out about putting something in my body I couldn't get out. ... This feels like such a stupid thing to be anxious over. I wish it would just go away. I'm 41 and never had this problem."
yes,"My agoraphobia is based around a fear of being trapped and having something embarrassing happen, like crapping my pants. I immediately started to panic because I felt stuck on the side of the road, unable to leave. I got so panicked that I told the officer I needed to use the toilet. I literally had to go into the brush on the side of the road to go."
yes,With my recent flare-up I'm trying to figure out a change in career since I'm not able to work outside the home.

yes,"i struggle with agoraphobia and monophobia. i get intense panic attacks when i am alone or in any situation where i feel i cannot escape. i always have someone with me at all times, but it has to be a safe person that i am comfortable with."
yes,I feel so out of place and i never know what to do socially and it feels like everyone knows im trying too hard to adjust myself to the environment im in. All of the social interactions i have make me feel like im doing something wrong. I feel like an alien on the wrong planet. Like im some freak who shouldnt be allowed in public because i make everyone else uncomfortable just by being there. I have to engage with someone and i do or say something that makes them weirded out or laugh at me. Every time i get back home from being outside i cry because everyone is just so awful and i dont understand what these people want from me. I hate myself for not being able to understand the social rules and cues that everyone else seems to understand.

yes,I had such bad panic attack I felt like I was almost going in and out of consciousness.
yes,"I was thinking pretty hard about this, and hear me out here. You all might think your triggers are ridiculous and stupid, I'll be honest they probably are, I know mine are, the nature of the illness and all that you know, but that doesn't change the fact that the fear and panic all of you feel on the daily, regardless of the why, is very much real."
yes,The guy I’m seeing has a tinge of agoraphobia. I bring him to secluded places outside.
yes,"I've been ruminating and obsessing over the possibility of falling sick or passing out due to the heat, to the point that i'm not actually focusing on revising"

yes,I’m so nervous I kindof can’t stop crying
yes,I've been dealing with bouts of agoraphobia for the last three year or so due to panic attacks and derealization mostly. I ended up becoming guy homebound and agoraphobic again. The thought of pushing it further makes me want to panic immediately. I get super overstimulated when my nerves are high strung in public which only makes the agoraphobia worse
yes,i cant go with him anywhere neither i cant let him to leave me alone at home because im scared to go somewhere where i cant seem to get medical help

yes,"12 weeks ago I hadn’t left the house in 6 years. ... Managed to go swimming! ... Ate in public (anxiety and ED made this impossible for years) ... Shopping in the city center (literally never thought I’d mange it. Ever.) ... And finally today! I got the bus alone into town. A 20 minute journey, I literally cannot believe it."
yes,"I’ve been homebound agoraphobic for years, I’m already freaking out and feel like I can’t do it. I don’t understand why my health and this baby’s health doesn’t outweigh the fear, how tf do I do this??? I’m literally going crazy. I need to go, it’s 30 mins away, I don’t know what to do and feel like a piece of shit honestly. I see people who say they push themselves etc, I literally can’t, I freak out just thinking about it. I don’t know how to override the fear"
no,Theres not much to say except I did it! I think the party is helping. I'm slowly starting to feel like ME again and using this momentum to keep on pushing. I have a long way to go but the hopelessness is starting to disappear.
yes,I explained my obsessions and compulsions and how heavy I lean towards avoidance... thoughts of harming myself and/or others... validating the possibility that my thoughts can turn to urges. I've been spiraling because of this.
no,"I didn't think it'd happen. After years of only leaving the home for doctors appointments, I finally feel like I'm leaving that part of my life behind. For a long while I started with walks with my partner in the early morning so I wouldn't see many people, and then after some failures and successes I finally decided I would try to go out on a date with my partner. And then.. it just has snowballed since then. It's just gone. Slow progression towards recovery really does work. I worked really hard recently on my body image issues and I think that's probably a key factor as to why I'm back to myself. It genuinely feels like I'm.. who I used to be, before all this started happening. It's like without the fear, I've regained my muscle memory in regards to socialising. The things that helped me the most I think have been the slow exposure over the past couple of months, working on body image issues that were holding me back intensely, and choosing to do things I actually want to do. For me, finding something outside that I really really really wanted to do helped a lot to get it all started. I just hope this can maybe motivate others to keep trying with the slow exposure attempts. I think they really do add up eventually."
yes,"I couldn't get a university degree because of my mental illnesses, but I can learn anything easily. I can't leave the house these days, and I need to earn money."
yes,i just can’t get myself past my thoughts? now im more anxious about getting anxious that i just end up making myself panic and im not sure how to stop it from happening. i’ve been feeling nervous even at home now and i feel like i have no escape from myself.
yes,i hate being isolated and alone. i can’t take it anymore. i just need a hug. i just want my old life back.
yes,"I couldn’t sleep, barely ate and just cried for hours on end...I felt like I would die if I feel this sad for even one more minute...My ocd won’t let me touch anything without gloves on, not even in my own home..."
yes,I'm utterly terrified. Any progress I may have made has been completely undone and I'm worse than ever. I'm so terrified of being hatecrimed or even just caught in the crossfire of a potential terrorist attack that the idea of going out makes me feel physically ill.
yes,"Got as far as the office door before it got to be too much. Turned around and walked out; now I’m sitting in my car in the parking lot miles from home, crying because I feel like I put myself through a huge amount of anxiety for nothing."
yes,"Every time I try to leave the house though, I just panic. It's really bad too, like I feel like I'm going to puke and pass out, just going a mile down the road. I don't want to live like this anymore. Consumed with fear, trapped. I miss going out and doing things with people. Exploring places I've never been to before. For the last year, I have just been miserable. Even when I'm home, I'm fighting off panic."
yes,I was agoraphobic for a few years
yes,i got the feeling those healthy people are much worse than we are
no,Is this because of the coronavirus? I don’t really keep up with the news since I don’t go out much anyway lol
yes,my girlfriend is now completely agoraphobic and anxious

yes,agoraphobic bf
no,Hm don't know about that one bud
yes,she yells
yes,"I have tendencies of agoraphobia, social anxiety, panic disorder, and anxiety and have a hard time being out in the sun during the hot summer months. The weather is uncomfortable and exacerbates my symptoms with the additional sweating, fatigue, and sometimes dizziness that accompanies me on a daily basis."
yes,I've been fighting panic attacks with agoraphobia for two years now and have been housebound for nearly a year.
yes,I find it slightly less anxiety provoking to go outside and when i have gained weight or hate how i look i find it completely impossible to go out
yes,"it felt like forever, the wait in that short line felt like forever, it felt like my throat was closing and my irrational thought were everywhere, I told myself “I can’t do this” “What if I pull forward to let my son In and I just take off before she opens that door” “I feel very far from home” “I can’t breathe” it was very painful and I feel like I never want to do that again"
yes,I was frustrated for a long time... just fear of getting locked out of my apartment building
yes,leaving the house for the first time in a month
yes,"In my 4 months being agoraphobic, I've seen many people claiming they had recovered but never fully."
yes,"I have an extremely unfortunate combination of autism, agoraphobia, panic disorder and ocd that means most jobs are a no go for me. I knew I probably wouldn’t but it’s still upset me quite a bit because all of these things mean I have basically a 0% chance of getting a job I can handle."
yes,"Sometimes it feels like the doctors are treating the wrong thing and other times it feels like the doctors don't really get what agoraphobia is at its core. I don't know. Recovery is just really hard and I feel like I'm not getting actual help or the kind of help I need, but at the same time, I don't know what I need."
yes,"I got an anxiety attack scheduling it but it actually quickly faded away after and I’m fine now. ... I know I will be extremely anxious during the test ... To cope with the anxiety I’ll just keep thinking about how glad I’ll be to have my license, and how much I need to confront the fear in order to move forward with my life."
yes,"I can control the panicking feeling, but not this time. Two women talked to me...I ended up clinging to them and crying in the isle. It doesn't matter what kind of interaction it is, I feel like the world is going to end when it happens."
yes,felt hot and then my body felt needles stabbing feeling all over the body I felt this 2 days ago as well which it did trigger a panic attack
yes,I was wondering...functioning again. I refuse to see this as a permanent condition. I believe i will fully recover or at least become a high functioning agoraphobic..
no,"So, i've posted recently about having a 1 & 2 year old and wanting to do things with them. Today me and the father of my kids took my kids downtown for a small petting zoo. There were soem chickens, bunnies and goats. They absolutely loved it. We ended up staying down even after the animals left because the father of my kids dad came down, so we just sat in the park for about an hour and let the girls run and play. Now we are at little thirft store that the father of my kids has been begging me to go to. Im in thr car waiting, but i will go in after him because it takes too much work to bring the littles in too. I feel good about myself. And i am so glad i made mt kids happy today!"
yes,I get massive panic attacks going across the parking lot at my work I take a step or two and I get faint (almost like I’m walking on stilts or I feel like my legs don’t work)
yes,"I truly hate leaving my apartment, I don't even like running into people in the hallways, I'm disabled and will take the stairs if I realize I will be riding the elevator with someone else, so I don't really leave my apartment until around 2 am, when I know all of the other residents will be asleep or not around... I don't have friends because I get paranoid and have panic attacks just thinking about leaving my apartment to hang with anyone... Crowds are a no for me (I left the apartment for the first time in weeks this morning to go to the Farmer's Market, I lasted 5 minutes before I started super panicking and needing to leave)"
yes,"I can’t stand still without thinking I am falling over. My heart will race, I feel so hot, my legs jitter, and I think I’m about to have a panic attack."
yes,"I’m terrified constantly. i haven’t had fun in 2 years. i can’t keep living like this it’s so exhausting. i’m so so angry. i’m sick and tired of all of this. i need an escape, i need to feel happiness. true happiness, not a single fleeting moment. i just want to feel alive again."
yes,I can’t go outside at night so in my dreams I also can’t go out at night as well. You’d think in a place like a dream you don’t have the same fears but often times my irl fears are still present in my dreams.
yes,I struggle with reading comprehension skills... I feel stressed out and overwhelmed.
yes,"I realized that I must have some kind of issue with being able to block out too much stimuli. A car driving by, a tree swaying, a child making noise… all of that data going in my brain but there is no filter to keep it as background noise. Each thing seems like an equal threat bc it feels like so much is happening at once."
yes,"I’m a long term sufferer, my anxiety levels have been high lately, I have Health anxiety as well and I just found out I need my second surgery in 6 months in a week: I had a hiatal hernia that was causing my shortness of breath and chest pain and now I can barely eat food due to my gallbladder, I get the worst pain of my life and it also causes chest pain and sternum inflammation from the gas. All makes my anxiety worse."
no,"I have been working my a** off to recover since September. It's horrible. It's hard. I hate feeling uncomfortable but I know if I want to bring ""normality"" back to my life I have to do exposure. ... Well. The reason I'm now finally pushing to get better after having housebound agoraphobia for almost 6 years is because my partner dumped me after 5 years in Sept. Mainly because she was fed up of us not ""acting like normal 23 year olds"" by going on dates etc. I realised I was fed up of being a shell of the person I was and have pushed myself further than ever before."
yes,I battled this for years...this was the catalyst for agoraphobia.
yes,I was able to cross the street today in two different directions...I was able to get myself to walk to a certian point on both roads.
yes,"having an anxiety attack. Also, stopped taking my meds so i'm extra sensitive."
yes,struggling with heat this year even going for a 15 minute walk i feel like shit
yes,"leaving the house is such a painful experience. especially going to work. my body hurts in 70 different ways, i can't speak, my mind is racing, and i feel like im 700 pounds. i can't work. i can't breathe. i can't move. i don't know what im doing anymore. i have no support system and im so ready to just take a bunch of pills again and go to sleep."
yes,Haven’t driven in almost 2 years due to homebound agoraphobia I had for 3 months and have been doing gradual exposure therapy ever since. I started last weekend with just driving down the street and that went ok despite my foot shaking on the gas pedal a little.
yes,"my brother (24) suffers a lot with agoraphobia, but he also had autism and psychosis episodes. ...he will stay in the house 24/7 for 4+ years. ...he may have one (psychosis episode) afterwards so he obviously feels significant stress. ...he locks himself in a room and doesn't come out until they leave. ...he's very obviously bored and constantly trying to find something exciting (often ends up being caffeine) which sends him into psychosis again."
no,"Hey! I’m 18 years old male. I’ve been struggling with anxiety/panic attacks and agoraphobia for 5 months now, everytime I left my house I was experiencing - chest pain, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath/hyperventilation, dizziness, depersonalization, and weakness all around the body."
yes,I just feel so unsafe like something bad is about to happen. I was fine while I was out but as soon as I get home it hits me
yes,"I have had severe panic disorder since the age of 5 and did not get diagnosed until I was in my 20's. ... I am sick to my stomach with worry. ... I had to use every ounce of strength I have to leave the house and travel a long way to the hospital to see her. ... I am so guilty. If I didn't have agoraphobia I could have spent the past year and a half enjoying being with my mom when she was healthy. I am enraged and mad at myself. Because of a fucking mental disease like this, I wasted precious time that I could have spent with my mother. Instead I buried my head under the sand and kept myself locked up in my 'safe zone' prison."
yes,Was able to go clothes shopping today. It took a lot of convincing myself to get in the store but I was actually able to enjoy it!
yes,I was finally able to hit the gym this morning solo! I have not been able to go anywhere by myself in over 2 years and I didn’t think I would be able to.
yes,the thought of getting a job makes me want to ball up in my room and never leave
yes,"I like to do my exposures daily. I can go everywhere in a 10 mile radius without any issues, I can't really expose myself to anxiety daily by going out of that 10 mile radius every single day."
yes,"I barely leave the house, can’t leave at all unless someone else is with me and I’m dissociating in some way the entire time. I’m 24 and I don’t have a job, a drivers license, or any friends. I survive the day by the usual forms of escapism like reading, watching tv, maladaptive daydreaming, etc. The adhd, anxiety, and autism have essentially taken over my brain. I feel like a blob most days. My brain sees no point in going out and making friends, it sees everyone and everything as untrustworthy or not worth investing into. It’s like depression but not. I miss being able to empathize with people, relating to them. Now I just feel like some alien that’s surrounded by humans. All the skills I developed over the years, gone. My already abysmal social skills, gone. It’s getting more difficult to talk normally and I’m stuttering all the time now when I talk, I didn’t used to do that. My brain feels like a washing machine that never shuts off, with the same thoughts going around in my head like an endless loop. I don’t even remember how it feels to “pretend to be normal, or mask” even though I did it for most of my life."
yes,I've been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety... I developed agoraphobia... I get panic attacks... I've been thinking about giving up... No one believes in me anymore and thinks I'm a failure... I'm just so tired of this feeling I feel like my life is worthless.
yes,I'm just holding my breath and gritting my teeth to get through it and go back home. What's the point of going to the movies and dinner if I'm not even living in the moment. You leave feeling more exhausted and drained than ever.
yes,"I feel guilty and ashamed for not being able to focus on work or education... I can't get distracted by anything else, I can't sleep, I'm shaking, my muscles are tense, I want to hurt myself and end it all."
yes,I'm afraid of people looking at me... I'm afraid of roommates knowing I'm working out... I get so many panic attacks... I don't know how to cope.
no,I baked a pie for my neighbors and walked it over without any problems. Feels good.
yes,I've been working on being able to leave the house by myself... I did a few errands and it was anxiety inducing but to a much more manageable level compared to the past.
yes,i got agoraphobia when i was 21 ... i lack independence when it comes to transportation. i just can't manage public transit and uber is expensive. i have a partial driver's licence which i want to upgrade but i still have anxiety around driving.
yes,"I typically avoid going outside at all during the summer and if I don't have any reason to, but I recently got a job! I started yesterday, and was late because I saw some bugs outside the door, but I made it in regardless. I also walked home instead of taking the bus like usual."
yes,I’ve had panic disorder my whole life and developed agoraphobia around last October it got bad after a panic attack that led me to the emergency room. I was having these panic attacks at work and had to quit my job. I wouldn’t leave my house at all even a 5 minute drive would induce a full panic attack. I can’t explain how much this felt like torture.
no,"I have been agoraphobic for about 2 years now, COVID made it even harder but I recently got put on some new medication to take as needed and it has really been helping! I was able to make it to my brother and sister in laws house for the baby shower! I was so proud of myself! I couldn’t make it down the road or even the end of the block without having severe panic attacks. Now today, for the second time, I went to my doctors appointment! Of course I was shaking almost the whole time and they said my blood pressure was kinda high from the anxiety but they understood and did another reading after the appointment and it was better, heart rate was still a little high but over all I was good! I can’t tell you how proud of myself I am. I was getting to the point where I truly thought I would never be able to get out of the house, that I was just gonna be like this forever, but I have so much more hope now, especially since I made it out of the house twice! One was 15 min away and the other was 20 min away. I just hope this inspires some people and gives some people hope! We can do it!"
yes,a professional gamer has agoraphobia
yes,"In the last few months ive dodged every single outing or anything to go outside. Yesterday when i went to the bus station i felt terrible and confused i was supposed to meet with my friends somewhere but i missed the bus on purpose. As i was walking back to my house i was miserable and felt guilt, i felt so bad that the anxiety can control me like that."
yes,"I got completely ready, I took my meds, but then I crumbled into a panic attack. I’m so ashamed of myself."
yes,I had a panic attack out on the street doing my exposure therapy last week. I feel like I got knocked a couple rungs down on the ladder to recovery.
yes,"I've been suffering from Agoraphobia coming up four years now, stemming from anxiety I've had for close to six years. I haven't left my house alone in almost four years, I haven't opened my door unprompted in an equal amount of time."
yes,I panicked and couldn't do it...I don't live alone - my family was down there and I didn't want them to overhear my therapy sessions for privacy reasons.
yes,"I was really anxious today knowing the yard needed to be mowed, plus when I went out the first time my neighbor was also outside about to mow. I panicked and left the mower outside while I waited inside for my neighbor to get done mowing their own yard and go back in their own house. When I did finally get out to mow, I started to panic in the middle of mowing and had to go inside again and recenter myself"
yes,"one of the inciting incidents of my agoraphobia was actually a job interview. i still have agoraphobia, and i’m too anxious to walk from my work to anywhere more than a few minutes away lol"
yes,"I felt like throwing up the whole time but as im writing this, since i just got back home, i feel so good. Im so proud of myself for the exposure i did today."
yes,I’m too scared to leave my bed and do anything most days. Not even leaving the house. Just getting out of bed and doing things is too overwhelming and I shut down constantly. Even going into the fridge to get food and cook  is scary and overwhelming. Going to see my friends is a terror.
yes,I wanted to get off that plane before we took off so many times.
yes,walking to the store that’s a few blocks from my home has been a huge goal for me and i finally did it. definitely almost passed out cause i basically had to run there to make it happen
yes,constant boredom of sitting in the house all day
yes,I got my first actual job but couldn't handle it. Was getting out for a few months then had severe panic attacks for months. And now I get terrible anxiety when I'm alone on top of agoraphobia
yes,If people could see how worthless I am they wouldn't hire me anyway. I wouldn't hire someone knowing they struggle to walk out the front door.
yes,I stopped feeling like a failure and my mental health improved... I get groceries delivered now instead of struggling and often failing to go to the store each week.
yes,"anxiety of cutting through traffic, missing my exit, driving too slow and getting honked at, etc."
yes,"I've been struggling with dp/dr over the last few months but I didn't experience it while I went to get the shot, which was amazing!!"
yes,"I stopped talking to my friends because of agoraphobia for over a year now. I feel very deeply lonely, while not wanting to interract with anybody at the same time."
no,"About a year and a half ago I developed sever panic disorder w agoraphobia. I quit a job I just received, I was housebound for months, I also lost 30 pounds in a month and a half due to not being able to eat. I paced around my apartment for months because of the severe panic."
yes,"having panick attacks over the mere thought of going, i'm a fucking looser that's what. i could have a whole better life if i wasn't so afraid and scared"
yes,mentally messed up
yes,High heat and humidity and even prolonged direct contact with the sun are huge triggers for me. I feel suffocated and like I am going to pass out when I'm in it... even if I'm simply in a room that's too humid I start to feel chest pressure and like my throat is closing up
yes,So I’ve struggled with agoraphobia for years...I feel like it’s gonna make people see me differently...I had an argument with someone I classed as one of my best friends I recently opened up to her about having agoraphobia...I feel so betrayed because I didn’t want random people knowing all about it.
yes,"Everytime I try to leave my house, I feel like I'm about to faint or lose my mind and my dpdr gets much worse which scares me."
no,It’s also fun to send the pikmin on little expeditions to get things. This game is like having little buddies that are eager to go places with you. You can also connect with other people who can send you postcards from all over the world. There’s an element of curiosity about the world and environment that I really love about this game.
no,Thanks! I downloaded it. Pokemon Go (also from Niantic) encourages me to go outside too.
no,I love pikmin!!! its so fun when u unlock ones w special decor. i got a little popcorn guy from the movie theatre the other day SO cute
no,"I just downloaded this, I’m excited :) thanks for the rec!"
no,Aww! I keep getting stupid ones with stickers with a letter on them lmao. I did recently get a coral seashell white pikmin though which was awesome
no,I really hope you enjoy it. I cannot endorse this game enough. I’m obsessed
no,omg i got a sticker one the other day too theyre a little funny
yes,"I experience heart palpitations, but I think what’s worse than that is the dizziness. I get so dizzy to where it feels like I’m going to pass out(this is my biggest fear). I felt like such a failure and like everyone was able to notice my panic."
yes,45 minute wait in a tiny room in an unattached outbuilding while the contrast gets in my blood stream. Another 45 minutes in the tube in a room that is run down and super old. Plus I have claustrophobia so that makes it worse.
yes,"I was housebound. Living In total hell, or at least what seemed close to that. Not having, the ability to get out of the house. I was in deep isolation. Living day to day in fear, stuck in home."
yes,"I’ve had agoraphobia since I was 14 years old, I’m now 34. ...trying to give myself the courage to go to a family party that I probably won’t be able to go to anyway because I’m too drunk."
yes,"I feel disconnected people feel weird to me like unfamiliar, dissociative type stuff?... Been trying to ground myself, focusing on details that are the same as they always have been... My caveman brain is active, it will stop, but caveman brain require simple reassurance like familiar cave, not being alone, familiar sounds and smell."
yes,I go into a dissociative anxious state every time
yes,"I have panic disorder, and never leave the house because I’m scared to have a panic attack away from my room. The thing that helped me was realizing that it doesn’t just happen outside of the house. It happens anywhere for me."
yes,I still remember the day that I had the panic attack that left me feeling the way I still do to this day. I started going to the therapy and my doctor diagnosed me with agoraphobia... I couldn’t even open my eyes without wanting to scream so going outside was out of the question.
yes,I had a very bad fear of a shooting happening at my school. I would not be able to focus in class so my grades were very bad. So i ended up failing all of my classes and i was too scared to go to school. I do not leave the house much these days. But when i do i often have the thoughts that there will be something like a shooting or i will be taken. I have also developed very bad sleeping habits due to fear of someone breaking in. I am unable to sleep most nights and i will usually not sleep till 6 Am or later.
yes,"I feel like Im old because of my health but, I’m also so far behind and feel mentally 25 maybe so on odd occasions when I have to interact with other 40 year olds, it doesn’t feel balanced with anyone. I just feel judged. All my life I have felt behind because I couldn’t get involved in life’s happenings. Other people my age are doing so much better than me. It’s embarrassing to me and I am ashamed of myself because of this."
yes,"I've recently started developing agoraphobia. I'm terrified of humans, of leaving the house for any prolonged amount of time. I feel physically sick and anxious."
yes,I had troubles with driving/riding/walking over bridges in the past.
yes,"I hate being in situations where I feel like I can't escape, but it's different to claustrophobia, because I can handle small spaces as long as I feel like I can escape. I hate big meetings and I always scope out the nearest exit. I always feel like I have to be close to a door. I don't like being in situations that are out of my control."
yes,long lines give me anxiety... gave me anxiety bc i didn’t know how long it was gonna take to fix it... it was scary as hell and had some lil panic moments
yes,"I have an anxiety medication that I will take that day. I hate the idea of being trapped, being surrounded by only strangers if I start having a panic attack, and I always think about what if I have a freak health concern that needs immediate attention and I’m stuck on the plane."
yes,"I’m currently at a train station about 2 miles from home and trying not to have a breakdown. I’m on the edge, trying to concentrate on watching all the lovely people greeting each other off the trains"
yes,I am struggling... I felt it made my heart race which I hated. Has anyone adjusted to a different med after Wellbutrin and has it helped your agoraphobia? I am also very health-anxious so trying a new medication actually stresses me quite a bit
yes,I've barely been able to go to stores alone for the last 7 years or so and this marks the 2nd week in a row i was able to go. This week was a bit easier too and I didn't have much anxiety in the store
yes,"I’ve been agoraphobic since being assaulted by two police officers at a routine traffic stop last year. The more time that passes, the worse my agoraphobia gets. I’m so afraid I’ll never be able to leave the house without such an overwhelming amount of dread."
yes,"I'm terrified that I will get on the plane, have a panic attack and demand to be let off."
yes,I feel like no matter how much I progress it can never feel as it once did because I know these thoughts and fears exist now.
yes,I was sooooooo anxious leading up to it
yes,"I avoid him at all costs. I don’t have a space for myself unless I confide myself to my room. I often, if not mostly, dodge or ignore appointments. I go for days without picking up my phone and I leave messages, emails unread from all friends, family and colleagues because I’m scared of what they will contain. I get so anxious when I am around them in person. I work from home so all my communication with work is digital. It’s very easy for me to shut off from the real world, and now I only leave the house to go to the shops. Honestly I don’t like interacting with other people, no matter who they are"
yes,I seems to have a panic attack anytime I’m in the shower.
yes,"I haven’t been to the dentist in 6+ years, I’ve always been anxious about going there, and after I stopped getting insurance from my dad’s job, I stopped going. I know 100% I have at least two cavities. One tooth is very sore, the gums around it bleed, the other side hurts when I chew. I’m so anxious about going there, just knowing that I’m unable to leave when I’m in the chair makes it tough."
yes,"I feel scared I'm going to have a panic attack or something. This phobia sucks. I'm planning out what I'm going to do in an emergency of a panic attack, and worrying about it."
yes,I couldn't even stand near the street without panic
yes,"I've struggled with agoraphobia for about 7 years now, started out of high school and has been downhill since. I only ever go outside to take my dogs out now, I never step out for any other reason."
yes,two years ago today i left the house and went for a swim in a family friends pool. i was diagnosed with BPD post agoraphobia remission which i'm still trying so hard to get better with.
yes,"I’m exclusively working from home at the moment due to my agoraphobia. ... I was very dissociated the entire time, but I was successful and now I can work from home normally tomorrow. Propranolol is honestly a lifesaver, because without it I am guaranteed to have panic attacks when I go outside"
yes,I left my house for the first time In 3 weeks. And I drove for the first time in 4 months. So what you have a panic attack? A panic attack won't kill you. It's just uncomfy for a little while and then your fine again.
yes,i have anxiety walking from my door to my car. taking out the trash. getting a package from my front door. sometimes i can’t even stand by my own window in fear that someone will see me.
yes,"I developed agoraphobia and began having frequent/ongoing panic attacks when I was about 17 due to some health issues I was having and because I had been dealing with untreated social anxiety for years prior. lately I have had some smaller bouts of agoraphobia... my concern right now is that I am traveling next week to visit a friend about 5 hours away, and it’s looking like my period is going to be late and it will overlap with this trip. how on earth do I get through it, with all the physical symptoms like dizziness and the dissociation/anxiety?"
yes,"My agoraphobia has snowballed from being unable to take car rides, to unable to take train rides, to unable to walk too far from my place to unable even walk round the corner to see my family in the space of a month. I still feel like I’m going to die. It’s fucking terrifying. I need to get home ASAP and all I can think about is dying in the street because I’m breathless, chest pains, feel weak and dizzy etc"
yes,I constantly obsess with finding the root cause. It's so draining.
yes,"I didn’t panic at all! I was barely even anxious, just a little overwhelmed!"
yes,"i've developed agoraphobia so bad that its hard to leave my room most days, and i've had depression for a long time making personal hygiene difficult too"
yes,"I ended up having a panic attack in the car last month which really traumatized me... I just get totally consumed with terror... I spent the entire 2 hours convinced I was about to die or pass out or have a panic attack and it was extremely uncomfortable... awful 24/7 state of anxiety, depression"
yes,"I have agoraphobia. I barely go outside, what makes me think that I can take on an 8 hour shift at some shitty retail store or fast food restaurant."
yes,my agoraphobia has been the worst it’s ever been... I still can’t even make it into my town on a bus... The thought of being stuck on that train to the gig is making me so miserable
yes,This fear of the outside world is one of many terrible illness that exist. I have made progress by taking baby steps and taking things one at a time and telling myself everyone is in their own world doing their own thing.
yes,"I feel anxious, but I'm settling in and looking forward to my three days here, but also definitely looking forward to being home."
yes,"I feel so behind in life, even if I became perfectly mobile overnight I feel like it would take years of catch-up to where people my age are. When I feel like this I let it get me down where I stop all progress."
yes,"I became housebound, and after graduating online, I took a 'gap year' to attempt to fix my anxiety. ... I'm feeling so fucking scared and like I'm the only one who is this hopeless in the world. ... I wish people actually understood how horrifying it is for me to be alive each day. ... I'm so lost, and I don't know what to do. I need a job, but I'd actually rather kms than get one than get one. I need to go to school, but it seems literally impossible for me. ... I just don't see how things will ever turn out. It feels like my life right now is just a waiting game until things get so unbearably hopeless that it finally comes time to kms. I don't want to. I have love to give, and I deserve to live a life where I can love and be loved. I deserve to have dreams and to be able to do things and go places. I'm just so sad, and I can't tell you how scared I am."
yes,I have been so afraid to drive on freeways and subsequently terrified of driving to busy areas where parking would be sparse and expensive & what if my phone died and I’d be lost in downtown? What if it was dark? And I’ll get robbed and shot (I’m a woman)
yes,feel like they've wasted the best years of their life and have absolutely no idea what they are doing just struggling to get through each day. Each small task is a struggle. A constant battle between wanting to have a life and do things but not being able to and knowing you won't cope. I feel like a failure.
yes,"i ended up walking to nature. i sat there for a while aside the creek, got comfortable. there were a couple random social encounters on my walk back, but they weren’t so bad. my mind was like “this is good practice”."
yes,having a LOT of anxiety about going to a dentist appointment this morning... worried cause what if i have to go to the bathroom or what if i start panicking like i doubt i can just get up whenever i want during a cleaning
yes,"Woke up feeling very anxious and couldn't even get outside to my yard to peg my washing out, it was that bad. ... 3/5 panic level was the max I got to."
yes,"I am afraid to leave my house and when I do, even to go to a doctors appointment I get super anxious. I think it is because before I knew I was sick, I would get super dizzy and almost faint from standing too long or walking when in public. So what happens now, even if I am sitting the entire time, I am convinced that somehow I will pass out in public. So when I am out I start to get anxious which actually triggers the POTS symptoms. When in public I feel trapped. I am scared for it and feel like I may have a panic attack when I get there"
yes,my sensory and social struggles heavily affect my ability to leave home. it’s not the only cause of my agoraphobia but it’s definitely a big piece.
no,"Hello all, ..."
yes,"I used to travel all the time on holidays until 15 years ago when agoraphobia entered my life. I've been given a prescription of Lexapro and Klonopin. I've never used the lexapro, and I only use klonopin a few times a year for challenging days or when my panic disorder kicks into overdrive. I've been working on exposure, and I've had success, but I can't easily simulate getting on a flight and being out of town for a week. Not going is making me incredibly depressed, but if I go as is I will be a complete nervous/panicky wreck."
yes,"I would get insane panic attacks before work and couldn’t bring myself to go in...I barely can go out without feeling like I’m gonna cry cause I’m so anxious. I couldn’t go to doctors appointments without taking Xanax before and I barely can go grocery shopping. I’m starting to fear the stuff I once enjoyed like shopping, hanging out with friends and etc. all I wanna do is stay at home it’s where I feel the most comfortable and I know that I’m safe...It feels like I’m scared constantly and I’m crying just writing this."
yes,"due to insomnia and chronic pain... I've been able to go grocery shopping, I've eaten out at restaurants with my husband a couple times, I'm even thinking of going to a thrift store today"
yes,"Terrible public transport anxiety and fear of unpredictable people /people wanting to fight me. I am always full of anxiety due to the fact I know I will be trapped on a bus, train, plane and unable to flee if my anxiety gets too bad. This also links with a worry that I will encounter unpredictable people in society, perhaps someone behind me that is drunk or antisocial on a bus or train etc. i am unable to relax for the entire trip because of this"
yes,"I developed anxiety towards feeling hungry after getting a bad flu due to covid...I'd get hungry very fast and even wake up due to the hunger, even having eaten a full meal just 30 minutes before...I started to feel extremely hungry, anxious, and getting heat and cold flashes...I had to switch to online schooling because I couldn't stand to be out of the house in fear of feeling hungry and anxious...I'm not alright with car rides or going further than a 15 minute drive somewhere."
yes,"I feel scattered and need lists/charts to keep me organised. In conversation I struggle to think of what to say, and most of the time I feel like I'm just floating through the day without really taking anything in. I feel incapable."
yes,"My anxiety makes me nauseous 24/7, even when I’m at home. I’m scared of doing those things and not being able to get out and rush home if I feel sick / am sick. I can’t seem to shift the thoughts that leave me feeling like I’m going to throw up 24/7 no matter where I am"
yes,"I've always had a small bit of anxiety...harder to deal with the staff made it even harder I stopped going out as much stopped attending school, I'm now at the point where I hardly ever leave home...I constantly feel sad and lonely...I don't sleep or eat well and my day to day life is getting harder and harder to deal with."
yes,"At 26 I’ve never had a job, been to a club, been on a friends holiday etc. Mine was caused by SEVERE bullying at school, undiagnosed autism/maths learning disability/adhd, an eating disorder, my dad dying when I was 12 & unsupportive/distant mother who has NEVER taught me anything because she has brain damage."
yes,"severe social anxiety, panic attacks when going out. I remember almost vomiting in a restaurant while applying for a job."

yes,"I was working 4 years at a company with people who were very abusive and set off my CPTSD daily, not to mention the sexual harassment, from one of the highest employees. My body was reacting to the massive amounts of stress the job entailed as well as the reaction to my CPTSD being set off and I got very sick very quickly."
no,"10/11 years, I’m 28."

yes,"my disability means I can’t hold value to any number past 4, like I can’t picture 5+ in my mind, it’s meaningless, so of course I failed maths. Combined with autism, I took her words literal"
yes,"I haven't had a real panic attack, during the times I managed to get out of the house. My chronic hives, vertigo, and anger issues have also been solved."
yes,"I became a recluse, rarely left the house, etc. I wouldn't be able to go to college now, it would be too overwhelming."
yes,"I just want to lay down and die. I'm morbidly obese, I'm a binge drinker and I think theres a lot wrong with me. I sweat so much, i'm so fat, walking makes me wheeze, i do not want to be seen. ... I feel like i'm dying and sometimes I want to die, others I get so fucking scared. ... I just passively want to die, I think of suicide but I don't want to do it, I just think of laying here and dying. ... I'm just so ashamed of what I am."
yes,"I’ve been housebound the past two years. this morning, I was dreading it. I kept going back to sleep hoping my friend would just realize I was sleeping and not ready. She ended up showing up at my house and the doorbell. She hung out with me at home for a little bit help me get ready and then once I got ready, I was about to get in the car so i locked myself in the bathroom and had a break down. just because a practice car ride is different than having to sit in the restaurant and feel stuck there."
yes,"I'm severely agoraphobic... I've properly been out the house only four times so far this year... Before the appointment I was having what I call 'undulating panic' (basically one panic attack after another) for five hours straight... I'm freaking out...

yes,I developed agoraphobia in Junior year of Highschool(2013) it caused me to drop out of school. Nothing really happened just one day my social anxiety increased and ruined my life. I feel worse than I did in 2013. I was suppose to go to a Figure Drawing class with some friends tomorrow morning but I got so scared it resulted in a 4-5 hour panic attack as I was trying to go to bed. Now the only time I can leave the house is if I bring my partner with me so I can hold their arm the entire time. I can’t even order at the drive through or get a food delivery. It’s so miserable.
yes,"I'm too scared to drive anywhere alone, can go out with people as long as I can get home easily but not without major anxiety. My agoraphobia screams that I want to stay home all day, but when I do I'm not actually happy to be at home, just less panicked."

yes,I can’t drive myself to store 5 minutes away from my apartment... I’m always worried about panic when I’m out of my comfort zone
yes,"I would be more scared of leaving the house than not surviving an ACTUAL threat to my life... This grief is almost unbearable... It's infuriating how illogical AND real it all is... I'll keep staying alive for the people I love, and I'll keep trying to find ways of staying alive FOR ME, but it's indescribably difficult today, and every day…"

yes,just anxiety
yes,walking past a road was really worrying me and I was really nervous but I got through it
yes,"I have an extreme resistance to leaving the house. I’m extremely isolated. I go out about once a week to get groceries, but that’s about it. I haven’t had a friend since elementary school. I dropped out of school at 13. I have no prospects or chances at getting a job."
yes,I live with my parents because of other medical condititions and it would be highly embarrassing to have him come over here... I can't drive because of seizures... the stupid agorophobia has made me lose almost everyone
yes,"I struggle with being outside of my routines and the feeling of being 'trapped.' Vacations and traveling because I'm outside of my routines and familiar comforts. I struggle with going out to eat, something about restaurants makes me feel 'trapped.' I don't like movie theaters because I feel trapped. I don't like riding in cars - I have to drive or else I get VERY anxious. I like to feel in control and driving helps with that. I need to sit on the end of rows of seats."
yes,I was able to go for a 13 minute walk around my block alone today.
yes,"I'm exhausted of this...filled out all the paper work about my long complicated mental health history...and made calls to insurance etc. all stuff I find incredibly overwhemling and almost retraumatizing/ incredibly triggering. ...I trigger myself so badly...the i try to think about how the hell i would stay calm in front of a therapist. ...I'm so ashamed. Ironically, it's shame that is perpetuating my agoraphobic issues. ...I lost every relationship and lost all contact with people. ...The avoidance is equivalent to rejection, and it's ruined me. ...I get overlooked and it's hard for people to see me as the terrified, traumatized person that ive become. ...I look like a pretty mean/unapproachable guy. So I resort to isolating. ...I have formed a very severe dissociation issue."
yes,anxiety I feel when getting ready to go out is overwhelming
yes,"I had severe anxiety for a week, and around the same time I had developed gallstones, causing some serious pain. I was taking multiple xanax daily, I couldn’t eat without doubling over, mind you my appetite was already nonexistent due to anxiety."
no,Wish me luck
yes,"I've been taking an as needed medicine for anxiety and it's really starting to help. I had a fun time (although slightly anxious) and they were super supportive! I cried a little bit cus a year ago I thought I would never get better and was starting to lose hope, but things are finally looking up"
no,"Thanks to your tips, my therapist advice and my own internal work I managed to travel alone and I went to a really big concert. The best part? I had an incredible time. I danced, I laughed, I sang… I had the time of my life and I can’t put on words how grateful I am that I’ve been able to do that. Ironically, I was so okay with the fact that I might experience high levels of anxiety that I didn’t experience much anxiety at all. And for anyone struggling right now, last year I couldn’t even go out to have a coffee with my friends. This is a long road and some days are harder than others, but we got this. You are not fighting alone."
yes,"I went on a 5 day Bachelor trip with 13 guys total... Weeks leading up to the trip, I was having massive anxiety. I had to take a 3 hour drive in a car that wasn’t mine with 2 other guys and sleep in a room with another person."
yes,"Today, going out just felt like something I had to do and I did it. For some reason I didn't overthink it, I didn't feel the need to wait till dark or right before closing to go to the store. There were a few people walking out and about and a lot of cars but I was okay. I just concentrated on music I was listening to and smiled at anyone who looked at me. It felt empowering to unknowingly feel apart of an unspoken community."
yes,i can’t go out with my friends. i’m a child amd i had to drop out of school and i can’t even go a walk without vomiting and breaking down
yes,"I've had lifelong anxiety issues (diagnosed with a panic disorder as a kid), but after the onset of covid a few years ago have been struggling more and more with leaving the house... The idea of going Outside for a walk triggers my anxiety so, so badly, to the extent that I just can't do it. Same goes for being in the (almost always) empty hallways of the building I live in... this anxiety/panic associated with leaving my house is almost always centered around having to go places that are 1. outdoors/open spaces 2. enclosed spaces that are NOT crowded 3. new places/situations... All of this anxiety becomes totally normal and manageable the MINUTE someone else is with me, but if I'm alone I just can't do it."
yes,I don’t understand why my mind and body can’t just normalize feeling safe outside of my apt again... Agoraphobia is ruining my life and my relationships. ...I just want to feel safe and normal in the world again.

yes,"I was super nervous but no panic!!! However when I got home , I felt it coming on. Like something bad would happen and just panicky ."

yes,housebound agoraphobics
yes,"I can't even shower I use wipes, and my life is indoors."
yes,"I refused to leave the house after that... I didnt want to live this way anymore, I dont know I just got really mad... I have agorophobia, and the fact that I live with my parents ( seizures )."
no,"Congrats on overcoming your agoraphobia! Does the person you’re dating know you had once struggled with agoraphobia? If they do know, maybe you could explain that all the action is a bit overwhelming just for now. Even people who’ve never had agoraphobia can get exhausted from a very active social life. Try working your way up. We all have our comfortable limits. Good luck and enjoy your life!"
yes,When you don’t feel like going is the best time to go. It DOES GET BETTER.
yes,I seem to be overwhelmed. When i’m out and socialising I have such a good time. It’s the physical anxiety symptoms which get to me the most
no,"You’re so right, thank you for this."
no,I know it’s tough. Feel free to reach out. You are not alone.
yes,"I walked to the grocery store near me, and went in and bought something!! i bought the first slightly appealing drink i saw but that’s better than walking out like i wanted. I felt about a 4/10 anxiety but that’s huge for me."
yes,I was talking to one of my friends (who also has anxiety) and how her boss doesn’t think of the stress she puts on her employees.
yes,"scared to try it, but I've heard that adhd meds can help with people that have anxiety possibly panci disorder"
yes,"I cant do any of these things. These silly simple fucking things most people can do without issues. Maybe one day I'll get there and be able to. But tbh, right now, it feels impossible."
no,"1 week post progesterone implant 
My life has changed drastically. 
I have ups and downs, but i feel completely in control of them.
I have not had a single panic attack even while extremely stressed. 
My entire body feels like i smoked a joint.
My chest pains are gone. My lightheadedness is improving. 
My ability to communicate in my personal relationships is drastically improving

I went to the aquarium on memorial day with my boyfriend and kids and (many people) and did not have a single bad thought about not wanting to be there even when my kids were fighting like little demons. 

None of my stressors have changed. But the way they are ffecting my body has. 

I do not feel 100% right. But my control over the situation and my head feeling in a constant ptsd like state is gone completely.

My depression is drastically improving 
I cleaned my house, i washed my hair and styled it and maked uped for not reason.

I feel human. 

Any women suffering from a coexisting pmdd like issue, sleep issues, headaches, stuff that feels like thyroid issues but your thyroid is fine, constant impending doom feeling, unable to control how afraid u get from a “jump scare” , ptsd like issues.  Extreme sensitivity to birth control or other medicines ,Please feel free to reach out to me and talk and find out how this helped me.

Its not a cure , everyones body is different. But for those who have tried everything and feel so completely out of control and like your body is a bomb that will inevitably go off.. and want to give what i did a shot…  and hear about how it affected me please message me 

No one should feel like this. And if i can convince one person to try this and it work for them it that would be amazing. 

My life literally changed over night 

Im going for a walk now, outside in the day time around my neighbors who were such a bad trigger to me that was practically tin foiling my windows ( joke sorta) 

And i hope this lasts , and each one of u get help like this one day "
yes,"With your agoraphobia, what is the max you can do ? Like going out etc"
yes,"I can just about have a shower and a coffee in the morning. Certain I was going to die, overstimulated, nerves felt like they were shaking, knot in my head. Didn’t die. Now will feel like I’m about to die for 4 hours. Trembling."
no,I know most of us have a hard time leaving the house for groceries.  Here's an instacart code for $30 bucks off. I know it's not much but every litte bit helps RCORLISS1711FB
yes,"A month ago while deep in my seasonal depression I was convinced I could never again go outside without someone I trust. Well and here we are, I did it!"
yes,He’s 29 now and our parents are very elderly. He’s rotting away in his room and I want him to improve.
yes,"I get this urge to just run back home which is what I assume to be the 'panic' itself. ...like I was about to fight a tiger instead of running away from it. Like that's how scary it feels to me. I automatically try to escape. ...mine just never calms, it just keeps going until I finally leave."
yes,"I was doing alright, but early in April there were several reports of new cases in the region and it terrified me. Now I have to go get groceries and I'm so scared, I don't want to do it but I don't know what to do."
yes,"I managed to stay at school, the whole day, without needing frequent breaks from the classrooms or leaving school entirely."

yes,I hate agoraphobia
yes,"I usually stay in bed most of the day...I only venture out into the rest of the house to go to the bathroom and shower or, kitchen for food, and to tidy up around the house and do laundry. I decided today to branch out and hang out in the living room for a while. However I do feel a sense of unease, and mild anxiety."
yes,"I'm legit a hermit. I'm talking I go years without leaving the house, no job ever, no friends, no lovers, nothing. I'm basically dead to the world because anyone who ever knew me or remembered me (Very few people), wouldn't even know I exist. I feel so hopeless... I just don't know what to do. I wish I could be 'Functional'... I get so much anxiety... I feel like i'm just a burden. I don't even feel like a human anymore."
yes,"I haven't been outside in two years except to get the mail, and today I drove to my appt. with somebody else in the car. I almost threw up on myself, I shook the whole way, but I did it."
yes,"For three years I've had agoraphobia, maybe 13 months ago I became housebound. I feel burnt out and often really depressed."
yes,I'm curious if anyone really hates leaving the house or traveling for fear of not feeling well and needing to use a toilet or having a bathroom emergency? And maybe your anxiety upsets your bowels so that makes things even worse? I have had since I was 7 years old!
yes,i lost all of my confidence and im just incredibly anxious about every next thing that comes out of my mouth or body
yes,Me: **Disassociating and realizing that I haven't explained there are 6 safe satellite locations nearby in walking distance and 3 are available after hours. Her office is within four miles all cardinal directions of a relatives home. That I have already assessed the strength of the buildings security and have imagined the quickest routes to render her unconscious if she tries to bar my escape. **
yes,"Agoraphobic 10 years recently discovered alcohol works. I'm out, in taxis, bars, dancing, shopping....I have my life back but now I'm terrified of developing a drinking problem."
no,"These are all equally important.

**Make the exposure therapy about having your panic attack.**
It's not about how far you get. Your goal is to have a panic attack, a few of them if you can. 

**You need to go home slower than you left home.** 
No sprinting back home. You go slower back home. This helps your mind understand that your experience isn't running from anything. 

**Do not take benzos for exposure.** 
Apparently makes all the work you do for nothing if you take them. This isn't to say don't take them. But for your exposure times don't have them in your system for a time.

**Don't white knuckle it**
 This is something I did. Every day I'd get out as a hope to get better. No real place I wanted to go. Even if I didn't feel good I'd push myself to get out. It doesn't help. Don't unnecessarily push yourself. Make sure you are WANTING  to get out. This is for you. 

I hope this can help others and I'm sorry if their are typos because it's on a mobile. Please learn from my mistakes. I have and I have already gotten better by this. I'm not cured and this is recent enough where I haven't made it crazy far. But it was a short enough time that I was able to be better.

We can get better."
yes,I was terrified (still am) and hadn't left my house in 4 months. I immediately had a panic attack when I came home
yes,"I get there to find out the office is on the second floor.... so before i can even think about it, i just get into the elevator. i'm already dizzy. ... i told her i needed to step out and i'd be right back. ... i felt tears welling up in me so I asked my mom to come to the bathroom with me and cried for a few minutes. crying really was what helped bring my heart rate down over anything else. ... once i was back in i started looking at all the things on the walls and picking up pamphlets to look at. and was calm enough to get through the rest of my appointment. no matter how much xanax i take, it's the crying that saves me."
yes,"i cannot sleep and recently feeling like i cannot be outside without feeling impending doom. i get burning brain sensations when im anxious and very stressed and i also move frantically, find myself doing my usual anxiety “tics”... im always looking over my shoulder and the Voices always tell me today will be the day i die... i also just recently got diagnosed with ocd... i constantly constantly constantly checking for any factors that could kill me while im out of the home and sometimes even just go back inside if i feel like the Voices are too loud today."
yes,I faced all of my fears and for the first time it felt okay and natural ! I had a mini anxiety at the end of the day thinking why there are no panic attacks occurring

yes,I’m 27F and my friends are all out living their lives but I’m obviously just stuck inside like 95% of the time. I’ve also been dealing with a horrible migraine condition recently that’s really been contributing to the agoraphobia.

yes,"I felt lightheaded and unstable on my feet, especially when crossing busy roads I felt so unsteady like I was going to fall over especially when waiting at the lights to allow us to walk.

I felt lightheaded and unsteady but didn’t fall over, and although I enjoyed chatting with my date - man the lightheadness and feelings of fear when walking further away from my car was so unpleasant."

no,"That I got cured of this. I was at some big mall with my parents and I just walked to the center of the widest and emptiest area there and didn't feel anxious. I then started to walk the aisle and it didn't feel bad, then I just started laughing and crying and running down the aisle feelin extatic that I felt zero anxiety to be there 😓 Was a bit sad to wake up to this reality where I know it'll never happen for real"
yes,"being stuck inside and just rejecting the urge to get on my bike, go in my back garden and get some fresh air and sun is making me miserable. I have triggers when it comes to summer because of childhood, being left alone in my house by my family and having no friends = a really sad kid."
yes,I had agoraphobia... The only anxious moments were when he was in the changing room I was 'alone'.
yes,it took me literal months to get used to going to McDonald’s. I’ve been too nervous to do those jobs.
yes,"I haven't been outside my front door, specifically down the stairs outside, in maybe even months, I've been too scared of it. But maybe night time is when I could practice it cause it feels safer and easier, I don't know... "
yes,"I had this dream that when I got older I'd buy a van and travel around the country... something obviously went terribly wrong in my 20s. And for a very long time I have dreaded travel. Yet underneath the dread, a buried remnant of the adventurous girl I once was."
yes,"I feel trapped. ... I have a panic attack when I get in line .. My anxiety is a lot worse because it’s smaller and it gets busy in there and crowded. ... I had a panic attack later walking my dog, but it’s fine."
yes,I feel so anxious I wish I could just be alone but outside

yes,I started speaking to someone really nice who I felt I could be honest with about my anxiety and agoraphobia. She agreed to meet me on a car park in separate cars (safety behaviour).
yes,I feel constantly guilty about cancelling plans or planning for the never ending event that life throws at you. Now it's likely going to be gradually reduced next week and I am now panicking about how life will suddenly propel forward again after a dramatic pause.
yes,I feel like I’m gonna puke. I’m scared to navigate the streets near my house because they are narrow and people run stop signs and shit. I think I’m going to be forced to go back in July and I’m freaking out.
yes,"I have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for 10 years now, which started after a hospital stay due to a panic attack triggered by drug (weed) use at a party. ... Despite these challenges, I try to remain active, for example, by jogging. However, I still avoid many situations due to the fear of having a panic attack (like driving highways, crowds, or just beeing away from home in general, etc...). I also notice that my mood is significantly worse; some days, I feel just sad/exhausted... on other days (fortunately, mostly at the moment) I feel more normal. But this also worries me. This wasn't the case before November. Where does this come from? Is it a kind of depression? ... the feeling of 'I need to get out of here, I want to go home quickly' and the fear of fear, the fear of the next panic attack, is still sometimes awful."
yes,it might be helpful to have a group of people to talk to vent to that understand and i think it would help my anxiety being on camera and talking to strangers
