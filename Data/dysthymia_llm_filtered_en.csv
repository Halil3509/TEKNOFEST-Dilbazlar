no,"Hey everyone,..."
yes,"whenever i get the house to myself... it’s like i intentionally turn into a disgusting slob... i felt the need to hide from the world... i can never bring myself to cook, i’ll eat disgustingly... i’ve worn the same sweatpants for the past 4 days... being in this lazy isolated state feels most natural and it’s what i want all the time. i don’t care about anything."
yes,"I've been suicidal for the past 10 years and still can't find a good reason to stay alive. I don't feel anything – except physical pain, exhaustion, sadness and numbness. Nothing excites me. Nothing makes me 'happy' or whatever. I'm not looking forward to anything because I'm so so exhausted all the time, I don't have the energy to do anything and if I push myself I end up in a big flare up from my fibromyalgia. And it just adds such a big feeling of powerlessness."
yes,"I am feeling horribly right now...I am so tired and fed up with it all right now. Can't kill myself, so I am thinking of ending my psychotherapy. Feel the need to damage myself, and don't even know if I can wait a few days for it to pass."
yes,I’m struggling to get out of bed and it’s so hard to find the motivation to do anything for the day. I don’t even know where I’m going with this anymore but I just feel lost on what to do/think.
yes,"This illness is so hard and in my experience, not widely understood. It is absolute hell, and often agony to even exist. I know how terrible you feel and how hard it is."
yes,I slept for 15 hours and got up at 5:30... Like wtf. I don’t know why I slept so long. And I feel absolutely awful because of it
yes,I try to embrace my indifference and boredom but it's difficult.
yes,"I have always had this habit of oversleeping during holidays... I was overeating and did not have a schedule to balance life between dance classes and work... Compound this to many years later and I find myself obese, unattractive, highly functional at work, high libido which gets expressed through fantasy more, low energy levels, loss of interest in things I like and a feeling of disconnect. I met a psychiatrist who told me it is indicative of dysthimia."
yes,"I always assumed when I get older it'll figure itself out. But ever since I was little, I was just getting by, surviving from day to day, not even with a thought ""when I get 18, I'm getting out of here"", cause I'm just one of these people who think ""yeah, my life is not important, more important is getting my siblings out of this shit"". So I just tunnelled all my strength and resources into my siblings. And then I decided, yeah, okay, no point in living anymore, my job is done. ... I've done my job. My siblings are safe and thriving. My life has literally no meaning left in it. I took it away when I was a kid and no one ever tried to return it to me, so it's not there. Nothing is interesting, everything is just to kill the passing time before I die."
yes,the 'what do I do with my life now' feeling settles in WAY earlier in the day... I'm so bored of living.
yes,"I've been stressed and depressed for months, but I've been dealing with suicidal ideation at a more intense level than I have in years. That and the fatigue are putting me pretty squarely in this double-depression."
yes,"I have Dysthymia, Major Depression, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Avoidant Personality Disorder, and Autism. I've been locked up in a psych ward four separate times. It feels like my current psychiatrist doesn't take me seriously. It almost feels like I'm a burden to her. One time she told me most of my mental health issues are just my imagination. A few times she told me I should just watch tv or play video games to feel better. She constantly says I spend too much time in my head, whatever that means?"
yes,"I have ADHD and some kind of depression (I assume dysthymia), so I often can't actually work up the ability. It's exhausting. I just started on sertraline about two weeks ago, and it's immediately helped a ton with my slipping executive functioning... But I can't shake the nagging feeling that this is only temporary, that I'll relapse, that I need to get whatever I can done before it stops working. Just as my ADHD meds haven't been working as well the past few years."
yes,had a major depressive episode while in said class
yes,When I am really struggling... It helps remind me I have reasons to keep moving and keep trying to get better.
yes,"I block people I love, say nasty things that I don't really mean, try to starve myself or intentionally watch upsetting things so I feel worse, etc. I eventually hit a point where my good old friend suicide ideation pops up and I start thinking about how it would be easier/make everything better if I just backspaced myself out of existence."
yes,"I've been in therapy a few times, and I find that therapists have a difficult time grasping some of the unique challenges in dysthymia. Particularly some of the self-awarness I've seen in other people with PDD (therapists like to fill in gaps in our awarenes), the focus on function over quality of life, and the fact that this disorder is often chronic."
yes,"Noticing im in a good mood will stop it in its tracks and if I don't notice i'm in a good mood, I get hit with sudden emptiness once it's over. It almost hurts. Like i fell from whatever high i was on and hit the ground. This is nothing new for me and it's been happening daily for most of my life but it hurts every time."
yes,"Mood, cognition, self-esteem, social isolation, anxiety, emotionally... I don't feel well at all. my mind is also battered at this point"
yes,"I've all my life tried to hide from the black dog. Then I changed country, became an immigrant, lost nearly all my social network. I started crying when I was alone. Over time I started crying in front of others and so avoided contact. I know that my negative conception of the world was the reason we argued. I wept reading the diagnosis criteria. It was so personal it felt like an intrusion. How did they know about the feelings of guilt and uselessness, the inability to hold down a career?"
yes,"I tend to not sleep until 2-5am. Sometimes I feel tired and simply unable to sleep, but most of the time I feel like I could sleep if I tried, but I get stuck on my phone which just makes it worse. A lot of the time it’s almost like I don’t want to sleep, like I’m content to just stay up and do nothing. I’ll go through phases where I either wake up around 8-11, others where I could sleep literally all day."
yes,"I don't feel my emotions as much anymore. I barely feel anything (not fear, not sadness, not happiness or anger). The only thing I am thankful is for my anxiety that is like my strongest emotion at the moment and it makes me feel something even though it is not for the most pressing problems."
yes,"I got low self esteem, blame my self for almost every situation, think i am useless , have lots of suicidal thoughts , maybe attempted a few times, all within the common signs of dysthymia i guess. Also I dont feel like living my life at all, It is not the same as the feeling of I feel i have experienced all that need to be experienced. More like i dont want any responsibilities and sholve all things to the side. I dont want to study to get better grades, i dont want to work to fit in with society , i dont want to own a car, house or start a family cuz it will be too much responsibility for someone like me. I am indeed running away from all the responsibilities in my mind . i really feel like a scum but i cant really have the energy to do any of them."
yes,"This dark feeling has stayed with me from as long as I can remember. The ability to perform well in school and the weight of expectations it brought from family, friends and most importantly, myself. The feeling of disappointment and the constant overthinking. A lackluster professional and personal life. This broke me in ways I'm not fond of having experienced. I resonated with my feelings of hopelessness, guilt, shame and thought I was going to die soon. I never acted on my feelings of self harm, but the imaginary sensation of my sharp knife sliding against my throat effortlessly brought a sense of relief."
yes,I have been on sick leave from work due to stress for three months and has felt like I don't have a purpose anymore. But to have a animal to care for is wonderful. When I feel low we snuggle.
yes,Or is this just something that I'm going to have to accept?
yes,"Nothing really interests me and there's nothing that I really want, if that makes sense."
yes,"I feel very jealous of Diane no matter what the situation is. I constantly compare myself to her, wishing I was as pretty and petite as her, or that I had the same outgoing and extraverted personality that she does. I feel like where Diane lightens up any room she’s in, I do nothing but dim it. I’m currently in a terrible depressive episode where I’m cooped up in my room and avoiding everyone. I think of my past relationship and how wonderful it was, and how I had to give that up for something I couldn’t even control and it ruined me. Now I have to see my “Lacy” have fun with a guy knowing she would never have to face the situation I faced that resulted in my breakup, knowing that everything works out for her or will work out for her and nothing ever works out for me."
yes,function at peak mental capacity on a daily basis with dysthymia
yes,"I only feel interested in stuff like animation and old novels, not because I like it, but because it was something that made me happy years ago."
yes,I have been suffering from PPD along with bouts of major depression on and off for over ten years. I also suffer from anxiety that seems to go along with both forms of depressions. ... Mine is debilitating and has completely taken over my life.
yes,"I have a hard time feeling happy. ... I feel like my standard mood is 'I am not really having fun being alive'. ... I thought having a negative 'standard mood' was normal for a long time and I'm not sure I can remember feeling generally happy about my life. ... My memories of my childhood - the few that I do have - seem so colorful, but life just seems so grey now ... I feel like the highs in my life are mediocre at best and my lows are extremely low. ... having low confidence and self-esteem, feeling tired, having no appetite, having issues with concentrating on things, feeling hopeless and pessimistic."

no,"Thank you, I appreciate your insight!"
yes,"I am inadequate and I've always known that... It brought every source of my inadequacy into crystal clear focus. My reasons for feeling inadequate are thus:... I'm a bad person... I'm selfish... I deserve it. I'm weak, powerless, and useless. Maybe if my desire to overcome it were stronger than my self-loathing, I'd be a better person. This is the way it's always been."
yes,"I've been drifting away lately, losing track of time. It's getting worse and it got me thinking... What is your anchor to your daily life? What keeps your mind from drowning? But lately nothing helps."
yes,I didn't do well in school but I somehow got through high school and university with depression
yes,"I write cue cards after each lecture so I don’t leave it all to the last minute, then I just shuffle through them, easiest way I’ve learned.. you just have to make yourself do it. I’ve had to remove the thinking from a lot of what I do for school because if I give myself the option, I’ll nap instead."
yes,"I've been struggling with setting myself realistic but optimistic goals. Because one day I might do great and the next I'll have almost no energy. ... with ADHD, anxiety and depression!"
no,I was always studying with other people as much as I could and tried to leave the house when studying.
yes,"I have GAD and ADHD in addition to dysthymia and this is literally the only way I can get anything done because my brain gets overwhelmed so easily, even on meds."
no,"I already use a journal but I hadn’t heard of bronze, silver, and gold. That’s a very creative idea! I’ll try that!"
yes,"I block everything and everyone out because I live such a pathetic and empty existence that I can’t bear for anyone to know it or witness it. I’m fundamentally unlikable as a person. I’m lazy, disorganised, and in general have no skills or interests in the world around me. I hate that I’ve created this life for myself."
yes,"I feel worse than I did before I was diagnosed. Now I just feel like I’m perpetually from the outside looking in at my life and feeling frustrated that nothings changed in my life for the past couple of years. At least in the past, I felt more “alive”, more easily excited and motivated to do/try things."
yes,"The heavy chest, the disappointment, I can't sleep, and when is time to wake up, I feel tired, hopeless, but I can't cry, it's been months since the last time I really cried, I need to rest but I can't, the nights are the worst"
yes,"My partner (26F) was prediagnosed by a psychiatrist with Dysthymia. She lacks needs, has constant concentration issue and a low self esteem. ... She got more and more aggresive. She started to be more and more verbally and physically aggressive... She was constantly crying. ... She was always crying or really abusive. ... She got really really insultive and threatend me with physical violence."
yes,"I’ve been wondering what the hell is wrong with me since I was 12 years old. I have low energy, anhedonia, inattention and a couple somatic symptoms. I believe it’s dysthymia that fucked up my life. I’m not officially diagnosed, but my psychiatrist hinted at it and I can put 2 and 2 together. I’m currently on Bupropion 300mg and Prozac 10mg. Neither improves my energy, but my mood is better and I can focus a little more. I think my anhedonia is improving, but I’m not sure."
yes,I could be depressed for like 3 days and then after I feel fine .. I feel like I’m always faking everything and being overly dramatic
yes,"I’ve been off. Just really irritable and wanting to isolate... whenever someone talks to me it’s like torture, I’m just so disinterested and all I can think is, “can you just shut the fuck up and leave.” I also love music typically but not this week. It all seems like unnecessary noise and ruckus."
yes,tiring to keep ruminating while telling myself not to at the same time. I don't want to harm myself or have suicidal thoughts but I can't shut off my mind. I'm just so tired of myself and my life
yes,feeling more broken down than I ever have
yes,I wish I wasn't so empty all the time. And the worst thing is that generally I used to be a very emotional person and now for about half a year I've just been feeling nothing except rare moments of sadness or even more rare - excitement about my plans etc.
yes,Coming from someone who has had dysthymia on and off for almost 9 years (and tried to kill myself multiple times before the age of 10)
no,"Oftentimes, the goal of medication is to get yourself to achieve these important goals that you normally wouldn’t have been able to do. Once you’ve made these things routine and they positively benefit your mental health you can begin to slowly remove medication. There is also a great, clear need for people to be on medication long term, but there is a path forward"
yes,"I've had this condition for 15 years, and the problem is that even if it gets better for a bit, I always end up in the same place: at best contentment, an acceptance of endurance. Never true joy."
no,"I need carbs, so sweet potatoes became my go to. But otherwise agree with all the above. Exercise is very beneficial too"
yes,"As soon as I think things get better I suddenly break and start crying and feeling bad again. Just as soon as I think I feel good, a wave of hate and sadness hit me. I dont want to open up to anyone again because of that and I want everything to be blocked out. I hate it all. I hate myself."
yes,"have yet to experience joy. Spikes of happiness that last a few seconds maybe, but I’m just so tired of this."
yes,I'm jobless due to complex mental health issues.
yes,Starting something and not finishing... I seem to just lose the will. I am now deluged by incomplete and unfinished tasks.
yes,"The majority of us just get fobbed off or stared at when we expect these so called professionals to do something. If you go in there with no expectations, you won't be disappointed if/when you don't get anything."
yes,I autopilot into my everything is okay mode and get nothing accomplished
yes,I'm on my seventh therapist. Not one of them has understood what it's like to live with dysthymia.
no,"It definitely helps to make note of your daily mood and symptoms, especially if anything has been different from your baseline. Any changes in sleep patterns or appetite too. Also, they usually ask what goals you have for therapy and what you hope to gain from sessions so maybe think about that in advance. Hope this helps and good luck on your appointment!"
no,Can i ask why you have such a low opinion of therapists when it comes to dysthymia? Just curious.
yes,"18 years worth of being fed bullshit, excuses and placebos have pretty much made me this way"
yes,"I've been put on my first antidepressant and received my first depression diagnoses at 12 yo. When I was 23 yo, I had my first panic attack and am now diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. ...he diagnosed me as cyclothymic with a dysthymic dominance. He told me that my panic disorder and anxiety are real, but most likely are an effect of being cyclothymic and dominantly dysthymic."
yes,"i think i have always run away from my problems. i never wanted to think about my own problems and myself, not even once. i have always had someone that i attached myself to. i have always thought about them and their problems first. i created new problems and the problems were about that person im attached to. and i didnt have to think about my own problems. ... i cant tell because ive always ignored myself and my own emotions. i always want to attach myself to something. i dont know how to live otherwise and im becoming lower and lower. i feel so tired. i cant remember anything happened in my life. i cant be aware what i do in a day, i often mix days and things i did. i cannot understand what i do, what i feel, why i do something."
yes,I just feel so worried now. I was diagnosed slightly more than a month ago and started taking meds about a month ago. I experienced side effects (dizziness and nausea) with the medication... I am just scared that the dizziness and nausea won't go away. It is so terrible to go through this especially so frequently and it feels like I can never get better at this rate.
yes,"Everything feels so fake, ...cheer us up and distract us from our pathetic lives."
yes,"The world seemed like an interesting place. But when I grew up the mystery disappeared and the expectations are now stone cold. ... And as I discovered everything.. I have nothing to look for in life now. this what makes my depression. The feeling that being alive is difficult, because there are very hard problems I need to battle with, and my desires and wishes are basically, not met, and in addition, sleeping in bed is just as interesting for me. I will not hurt myself but I'd welcome death if it would come."
yes,woke up and was unable to get out of bed
yes,He broke up with me because he couldn't handle a relationship due to his disease
yes,I feel terrible at the time. I feel criticized every time. Many times the inner voice is telling me to do something unaccepting the current me. I have zero motivation towards anything. I feel handicapped.
yes,"I'm just apathetic in general, and am unable to do even the smallest things. I can't tell whether or not my asocial tendencies are a personality trait. I currently have no interest in maintaining a relationship with family or friends."
yes,"I felt like a fraud and that maybe my 'depression' was just my poor characteristics and personality versus a real disorder. I felt like no matter how hard I tried, what therapies or meds I did, I was always one step behind other people."
yes,"all those years of numbness, self-hate, anxiety, addiction, toxic relationships, inability to regulate my moods, pain, sadness.. "
yes,"I keep testing boundaries to see how little work I can get away with doing while still sort of staying afloat. At some point, I just quit."

yes,I'm depressed and have a bad mood on top of that
yes,Dysthymia might be a person getting 'stuck' in some permanent 'freeze' reaction/habit after some early event/trauma
yes,"I have really been struggling with having anger towards my parents and my boyfriend. More recently, I have noticed that I hold a lot of resentment towards my parents because they birthed me into a world that I wouldn't choose to live in. I get angry because they have no true understanding of what I feel and go through, and how debilitating chronic depression is."
yes,"getting a haircut and being happy/pretty happy with the outcome but when I express it, it's not that enthusiastic"
yes,"I fear death and the finite emptiness of it, I tell myself they deserve better, I think of how everything can go wrong, I hate that I'm like this, I feel a deep shame about it all, and guilt for those around me that have to deal with me."
yes,I have a lot of autistic friends
no,If you hurt someone’s feelings they have the right to be upset. Our feelings are not more important or valuable that others’ feelings.
no,Nope
no,exactly i do this
yes,I’m done being sorry to others for having such a hard time with my mental health
yes,"I have to rely on myself for support and when you're mentally ill, that never works. It's why so many of us have no confidence, low self esteem and all the other nasty things that come from being alone and having to manage by ourselves"
yes,i'm still exhausted all the time and really struggling to see the point in continuing... i feel kinda flat and so tired... i'm super detached and its been like six years of this
yes,im afraid of my wants
yes,"A big symptom of my depression is to feel very numb. I can’t cry, feel sad, be happy, or feel anger. I like to watch super sad movies when I’m depressed or things I know will trigger me."
yes,"I couldn't make the voice stop, I could not restrain my brain today. I haven't been able to stop crying. I just want to function and be a responsible person without fearing of being alone in my own mind. I don't want to be afraid of being left alone at my house  because I may do something stupid, I am currently sitting right next to the kitchen and I am afraid of just looking to my right, because I fear that I may something that I will regret. I just don't want to be afraid."
yes,my brain turned bad. Just randomly started cry and feeling bad. For no reason. Those are the bad moments. I can live with a basic line of depressed existence. But this falling is hard.
yes,"I am genuinely not trying to brag, I’m just trying to be honest, I usually just… *do* make people laugh. I don’t know how. I usually say what comes to mind in a tolerable twist and it makes people laugh. It’s not always intentional. Inside, though? Shit’s hostile. It’s negative, *always.* I’m constantly on the defensive against myself and it’s exhausting. No matter how much work I put in, it’s always there, learning with me, growing opposite to me, like some fuckin Pokémon rival or Dark Link or some shit. It’s so tiring dealing with myself and the negative thoughts and the lack of motivation and everything."
yes,ive been on all the ssris all the snris a lot of mood stabilizers...i think its something i need rn because im feeling too much pain. i dont want to anymore. my eyes and skin hurts from all the wiping tears.
yes,I've been wrestling with mood problems off and on my entire adult life.
yes,I still felt like I was in a fog that refused to lift. ...I was constantly wishing I could die... I locked myself in the toilet and sobbed. My hands were bleeding and I was holding a bottle of xylene.
yes,"I sit on the couch doing nothing while at home. Motivation and discipline are an issue at work, too. ... I just didn’t want additional medicine to be my first choice ... My self-esteem is also extremely low, but I’ve felt like that was “natural” based on how much I suck at life right now"
yes,"I'm bored with life. I've never really developed any hobbies or passions in my life. I've thought about, or daydreamed about, plenty of different things over the years like woodworking or stained glass but then I realize I either have no one to learn from, am not certain I'm interested enough to sink the money into it or don't have the money for all the supplies I'd need, or honestly just seems like too much work to even learn and find it doesn't interest me enough to dedicate the hours to."
yes,I feel like my world is ending. I don’t know how to keep going. I’m just exhausted. I don’t feel like it’s ever going to get better.
yes,"I’ve been experiencing lack of productivity, physical heaviness, unmotivation, lack of interest, and depressive mood for at least 3 months now."
yes,I've been feeling so empty inside..and incredibly sad all the time. The longer I was ever not feeling that way must've been..maybe 3-4 days? I grew up so used to it I was about to accept it as something everyone go through haha
yes,I feel like nothing touches the dysthymia.
yes,"I have trouble understanding this condition, my therapist tried to explain it to me but since I also have ADD I cannot tell you a single thing I remember from that explanation. I am still struggling to fully understand what dysthymia is and how it affects my daily life"
yes,I can see myself on a crash course for a big double-depression episode. My anxiety is caught in my chest and my throat. I cry so rarely but I feel the tension in my jaw and my temples and my eyes stinging. My executive functioning is going all the way downhill. Getting up is more pointless than usual. My job performance is plummeting... I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to log into my email or perform baseless tasks. I don't want to wake up. I don't want to clean my apartment.
yes,"I have always felt like there was a barrier between me and everyone else, like I’m constantly watching myself on the outside or through other peoples eyes because I am so worried about how people are perceiving me. It’s such a constant thought of mine that I over analyze every action of mine until I spiral. ...my social comparison problems are incredibly unhealthy. My mood completely drops ...whenever I hear my roommates mention their bfs, academics, or just future goals....I just don’t think I’ll find the kind of love I want and need because I had it and I lost it. It’s just so tiring having to put on a face every single time I wake up so I can convince myself and others that I’m okay when in reality I literally just don’t want to be here or do anything."
yes,I feel bad that I don’t love life... I could have a good day and cry tears of laughter but go home and get hit with overwhelming sadness or nothingness. I don’t know what to do with me. I just feel no one understands depression/ prolonged unless they actually have it
yes,"After being diagnosed with Double Depression & Dysthymia and slowly climbing out-ish of my depression hole... For a long while I didn’t experience “joy”. I wouldn’t say that’s the case anymore, but I don’t really get hyped about things like I did when I was younger."
yes,dealing with my dysthymia is always...fun.
yes,it really sucks... it feels like none of the inputs to help elevate my mood fo anything and that it's just a waiting game at the moment... forcing myself to not just wallow at home all day... today is a tough day
yes,"I feel like my system can't start, like I can't get into first gear. Everyday since 11 years old, I'm 22 now. I shower once every two-three months, if even that. Getting out of bed in the morning is a HUGE ass chore. My thoughts are mainly about running away or ending it all. Then there are these awful thoughts that I keep thinking about over and over and over again. They never end. Never."
yes,"I've been burnt out for awhile and can never seem to escape it; I have a hard time keeping up with school, planning and executing tasks, keeping my anxiety and low self-esteem under control and have a terrible sleep schedule because it makes me guilty to sleep when I have unfinished work for the day."
yes,"I don't want to travel, I don't want a relationship, I don't want to move out of my childhood home, I don't feel any need to socialize or see friends. I want to be a kid forever, but if it were up to me I never would've been born. I'm just full of dread and I feel like I'm waiting to fail. Everyone is going to move on without me. I would always tell myself that I'm totally fine with not feeling joy or excitement... I don't see how I can do it without passion or ambition."
yes,"messed up brain hormones. Doesn't matter how much you know about being happy, you won't be if your hormones are out of whack."
yes,"I have been looking forward to not existing since I was twelve. In 30 years, nothing has changed my mind."
yes,"I wanted to die, then started to take SSRI again and now I feel like a human being again."
no,👍
no,Figured it would be helpful to share success storied and possibly help others here. Thanks
yes,"I feel like I'm never gonna have a future ahead of me; everything feels so hopeless at the moment. I've got a job, 2 degrees, friends, passions, but just feel awful."
yes,"I'm constantly unmotivated, tired, don't find as much enjoyment in things that I used to, and generally feel a bit down all the time."
yes,"I realized that my debit card was missing minutes before my dad pulled up on the driveway. ... I screamed at her, told her, “you’re not listening to me, you’re not listening to me, you’re not listening to me” and I was getting so frustrated too because my dad was showing how exasperated he was that we ended up not going. ... In my first and only therapy session I remember telling my therapist of childhood memories of being left on my own by my mom despite me crying / pleading with her not to leave me. ... I wonder if all my hurt which are surfacing now are residual feelings of abandonment."
yes,"So for as long as I can remember now, I've felt off... ...I've always had what I would presume, would be critically low self-esteem... I've been sort of numb... not all the time, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten much much worse. Days in general range between 2/10 bad, to 4 out of 10, but never higher. I don't ever get happy... I think I meet every requirement for Dysthymia except for the appetite ones... Everything is so grey. I have nothing to strive for, nothing I want. Nothing to make me happy. If I didn't have my kids, I probably would have killed myself on a bad day, but mostly... everything is just... bleh."
yes,"I was a fairly intelligent achiever in primary school... Then gradually the fatigue, low mood, lack of a social life, no motivation, personal crises about being a failure at age 12... Average GCSEs when I could've got As and A-stars... Year working in a bar crying myself to sleep... Threatened suicide. Got job delivering pizzas. Resigned after a year due to stress. Fought with parents. Ran away. Tried to get another job and live on my own. Resigned. Attempted suicide. Moved back home after not being able to pay rent. Kicked out. Became psychotic... Want to die."
yes,"I was convinced that all people feel this way but they are good at ignoring it or pretending. I spent too much time when younger convincing myself that this was the normal human reaction to my situation, then when my life got better and my mood didn't improve I assumed it must be the general stress of work, but my work really isn't that hard, and most people don't react in this way."
yes,"Still feel like shit. What can I do. Meds don't help any my psychiatrist won't up them and just discharged me... I've tried caffeine, smoking, anything. Nothing helps. Anything that does help is actively VERY HARMFUL. I'm out of ideas..."
no,"I posted here a while ago, wondering if what's going on with me might be dysthymia and be worth going to a therapist again or if I was just a lazy person who happens to have depressive episodes sometimes. I got a few really kind responses, which helped me pursue therapy again. Ultimately, I hit a real low point and couldn't go on as before. Luckily, I quickly found a good therapist. He said to me in our second session 'You are chronically depressed, which is quite obvious and I think you could benefit from antidepressants.' Mind blown. I've had that thought before many times but always downplayed my struggles. I was never prescribed an antidepressant before, even though I had severe depression before and an attempt. Probably because I was a minor at that time. Anyways, I got an appointment with a psychiatrist (very soon again). She really listened and prescribed me with buproprion (I think its known as wellbutrin in the US?) and I'll start it tomorrow. Finally. I'm relieved but also nervous. Also hope the side effects won't be that bad. I'll see. If it doesn't work out, I'll try something else. Idk what this was, just had to get it all out and felt like it would fit here."
yes,"I’ve been emotionally numb for many years, my short term memory has been going to shit, I’ve completely lost all motivation for working out, I never feel happy, even when my family dog died, I kinda miss feeling sad though."
yes,"I'll be at my baseline one moment, then out of nowhere I'll just be absolutely numb and not even have the energy to eat, or I'll be numb but impulsive enough to hurt myself and I've almost attemped suicide, then im back at my baseline again."
yes,"I still have a wish in my head that i would get the courage to end my life and its always there, in the background of every day life."
yes,"I get 'cycles' where one part is where I'm a functional human being and the other part is where everything feels numbing that I lose motivation so eventually I give up on doing whatever I need to do. In high school, the pressure of my parents bothered me the most. I had several breakdowns. I remember isolating from my friends and crying after classes. I remember zoning out from conversations and forgetting that I even exist. There were instances that I have thought of suicide. Fast forward to me in a prestigious college, my procrastination habit has become worse. I may have developed a gaming addiction as a coping mechanism. I still feel the same - numb - most of the time. At my low times, that numb feeling becomes worse. I become more aware of my reoccurring thoughts. I sleep most of the time."
yes,"I struggle to find any reason to keep on going...What's the point of going forward if nothing in life brings you joy? I can't seem to enjoy any hobbies, working 40h weeks for the rest of my life will drive me to insanity and the sight of friends and people all around me having dreams and aspirations is just crushing."
yes,I can now count all my friends on one hand and I’m ready to end it all. I just want to be free of this pain and this world. My problem is I’m too much of a coward to kill myself. Until then all I can do is sit and be sad which is my favorite and only thing I know how to do.
yes,all my family does is downplay my symptoms and tell me to surrender my soul to god so i can be happy. my mom urges me to go to a psychiatrist but after that she doesn't even want to learn about and understand my disorder and thinks religion is still the answer. my grandma calls me selfish and uncaring if i fail to comply with her needs because of my symptoms. it's suffocating. i need support too other than my medication.
yes,"I remember so many days where I felt like a zombie going throughout my day, always so tired, and unmotivated, and so blah. ...sometimes it would last a few weeks, other times it would last a few months. ...I had a really bad episode after that. ...I was struggling to pull myself together"
yes,I fear that a job will not make me happy at all and it will kill the only things I still enjoy in life. I know this is some kind of struggle pretty much everyone has to face but in combination with dysthymia it seems even more problematic.
yes,"I dread answering any questions like that and I usually just give a generic answer or I take a really long time to answer what to most people is a pretty straightforward question. It's just hard to say their my favorite, like I don't feel that strongly about them to label them a favorite. This feels like such a trivial thing, but I'm always so afraid of being asking me and not knowing what to say and coming off like a boring shell of a person."
yes,"It's quite likely that I've been dealing with the effects of early childhood abuse all my life. Clinically, it's ptst, dysthymia and derealization."
yes,"I’ll find myself feeling like I suddenly have clarity on what I need to do to turn things around. For example this past spring I had a craft business idea that I was sure was the answer to my lack of any other career plan. I was overflowing with ideas and started collecting materials and looking into business rentals. Then just as quickly as it came on I completely abandoned the idea and lost all interest in it. Another time it was an online training program for a new tech career. I came up with a study schedule, was totally confident this was what I wanted to do, and stuck with it for about a week before completely changing my mind."
yes,"I ponder how life will be when both parents are gone as i have more communication with them as they don't have any responsibility and have more time, i also communicate with my siblings but its not the same, they now have their own families."
yes,I can then tell you about some of the shit that has me super fucking depressed this week?
yes,I long for the comfort of my bed. I can stay in bed all day. It sometimes hurt to even just get up. Nothing is interesting.
yes,I’ve been mildly depressed since puberty started for me 20 years ago.
yes,"I have had dysthymia half of my life, I’m now soon 30. It feels quite rough to know that there is a chance I will continue to struggle the way I do for the rest of my life. I have accepted that there is a big chance I won’t get better without meds. I can’t help but feel that life just simply sucks. I find many pleasures with life now and then, but there are even more stressors and sad thoughts for it to save my mood."
yes,I've always taken sertraline at night before bed but wondering if it might be more beneficial and effective to take it in the morning
yes,I found it really useful for reframing my goals and outlook on life given that dysthymia is something I will always need to manage.
yes,"No direction, no enthusiasm, feeling like a shell, no sense of accomplishment, negative emotions, melancholy, lack of interest, feeling like I'm just going through the motions, not feeling surprised or finding things funny, feeling like I'm just punishing myself with hobbies, not feeling the beauty of nature, and feeling like something is wrong with me."
yes,"bad thoughts, didnt study, didnt have a good workout. Getting out of the bed was a sacrifice ... feel like a empty jar that will never be filled."
yes,"I don’t want to go back, but I don’t know when or if the government is going to step in and do something."
yes,"I think I will enjoy... what’s the point? Why am I even doing this? It’s this fog that comes over me every single time... I don’t know how to move past it, and I’m tired of it."
no,I’m sober so please no weed or psychedelic recs :)
yes,I feel like that's my main reason I struggle with work. I would rather sit on the couch doing nothing. Boredom is like pain. Work feels like someone dragging their nails across my arm.
yes,I isolate myself so much in my room and feel like shit because of it. I can spend all my time in my room and wait till everyone goes to bed before going downstairs. I feel so much guilt sometimes because I rarely see her when she gets home from school
yes,"I've been feeling like shit almost all winters, I've been wishimg for the courage to kill myself cause i was close to trying but couldnt do it. Im trying all I can to stay afloat but i can only do it for so long and idk what to do now."
yes,I want to die I don’t want to be here. I’m in so much pain. I’m so alone.
yes,"I've been taking meds since then, but relapsed many times. lately I've been feeling like i am a robot, can't control my mind, too many ideas, suicidal thoughts, etc. two weeks ago, I try to commit suicide but I couldn't. I feel weird and like things are out my control, it doesn't matter if I'm low or high. I can't stop my mind. I feel like I'm about to lose it every fuckin second of my life. "
yes,"Girlfriend has been suffering from high functioning depression. Has low self esteem, constant doubts about herself and people around her, indecisive mostly all the time, cancels plans last minute, cries randomly saying that she is better off dead. She has told me that her depression is like a mask and is very exhausted when she is done with her day. Sometimes it’s hard for her just to get through the day. It’s difficult when she is bubbly and all because it makes me say “what depression?” But I can see it through her laughter. It’s not a real laughter; it’s a laughter to make sure others and herself know she isn’t struggling when it’s just a facade."
yes,"I'm paralysed by fear of failure, and numb to most things going on, and isolating myself in big ways; now a lot of that has shifted to shame... I feel fraudulent and lazy; but also just deeply tired of even trying to exist."
yes,I had thoughts of locking myself in my baby armoire. I also had other ideas about how to end myself. ... I'm on medication which only keeps me away from suicide. ... I hurt and yet I'm numb. ... I think the feeling of not belonging is from being on the autism spectrum. ... My heart is broken because I let my family down and turned into a loser.
yes,Recently diagnosed (38 m) and I would like to avoid pharmaceutical treatment options.
yes,"I started to 'loose' my feelings, happiness and excitement just got more difficult to feel and less frequent, my motivation about everything dropped to nothing... I feel like if I was more sentient I could improve the way I interact with people and form new and better relationships. But I just can feel anger, fear, sadness... and disappointment. I don't know what to do, recently I've been feeling really desperate about this... I'm scared."
yes,"I feel a lot of different emotions and no emotions at the same time...I have felt alone my whole life and for one of my oldest friends tell me they can't handle even talking to me anymore really hurts. ...I feel like I'm just here, like sometimes life doesn't even feel real. Hard to describe. ...I feel lost, sad, alone, unseen and pushed aside my whole life that I no longer know who I am. I haven't for years. I feel like an imposter. I just want to know what being happy feels like."
yes,I have absolutely zero desire to socialise
no,"This post is a follow-up from these 2 previous posts:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dysthymia/comments/8dcoxt/started_microdosing_this_week/
https://www.reddit.com/r/dysthymia/comments/87xuz2/magnesium_anyone_using_it/

So I have been taking Magnesium daily for 2 - 3 weeks and microdosing on mushrooms (psilocybin) for a week and a half.

I have definitely noticed an improvement in my overall mental/physical health. It's not night/day as some describe (perhaps with further treatment it may be), but for me it has had made a NOTICEABLE improvement in my energy levels/thought processes.

Firstly the Magnesium:
One tablet a day in the morning with water. Chose a brand that has multiple types of Magnesium for maximum bio-availability as it is not easily absorbed by the body. Straight away I noticed two things: 1) I am sleeping better 2) my energy levels throughout the day are better

The microdosing:
Taking about 0.5-0.8 grams a day of dried powdered mushrooms. I take this for 3 days and then have 2 days off and repeat. By the 2nd/3rd day I noticed that my interactions with others (usually at work) was less painful and conversation flowed more naturally. I seemed to tolerate people better. I still suck at small-talk and whatnot, but interacting with others seems to be less of an issue than before. Secondly, I seem to be more focused on things, solutions come faster and generally I feel like I am firing on more cylinders than before. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I certainly feel more connected to things than I have before on a daily level (not spiritually or cosmically). Motivation seems to be returning as I have an important project due this week and I haven't been leaving it up to the last minute as I usually do.

TL;DR
Magnesium : Better sleep and energy levels
Microdosing: More ""connected"" and focused in general. Less dark thoughts and better motivation.

More to come as the experiment continues."
yes,feeling depressed because they act like there's some kind of quick fix... Makes it feel like my fault
yes,"I don't *feel* depressed compared to my darker periods, but I don't feel *right* either. Just kinda numb ugh"
yes,"grieving, depressed haze"
yes,"I was in the worst double depression i’ve had in quite a while all of this year, it finally cleared around October, and in November I decided to end my 3 year relationship, sending myself right back into another double episode. I’m left with the disappointment again of remembering that happiness just literally doesn’t exist for me."
no,Yes.
no,"That's because they're not really interested. People always give up patronising, clichéd bullshit just because it makes them feel like they've helped some way. It does more harm than good"
yes,"The family, though, they don't get it."
yes,I've been feeling hopeless and quite apathetic...low energy that's been plaguing me everyday...having no routine whatsoever literally saps all motivation and energy from me that I end up lazing around and doing things on autopilot.
yes,"I catch myself thinking if it will ever end. This past month ive had 3 really big breakdowns. I had forgotten how i was like before and how bad it was. I try to do better, i tell myself it’ll be okay. But will it really ever be? Because now i dont have faith. Pills make it bearable but thats just what it is. Bearable. Ive got no support. My parents dont care for mental health. Ive so much stress in life and no outlet to pour it all. I want it to end. I dont know what to do anymore."
yes,"I'm always exhausted from any socialising whatsoever, I can't take it anymore."
yes,"I don't seem to get mental “rewards” from things. I don't have interests... When I accomplish tasks, even if I really force my way through well enough to do a GREAT job, I don't feel good about it. I can feel relief if it helped me escape negative consequences, but never anything like pride or happiness that I did it."
yes,"I feel like I am chasing this mythical dragon of ""contentment,"" but no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, nothing feels like enough. Everything feels like a chore, and the things in my life I should be happy with ... I'm not. I feel empty. I'm not suicidal; I'm not crushingly sad; I'm just ... not happy. It is a grind."
yes,I feel like I will just dump emotional vomit on them. So I try to swallow it all in and pretend I'm okay.
yes,"I’m feeling positive, hopeful, driven... ...two days ago I thought about killing myself... ...I am an empty shell... ...intense feeling of apathy... ...I think about what I would put in a suicide letter to my friends... ...I wish I didn’t exist... ...I’m making a suicide plan... ...I think about taking my box cutter and slicing my arm from wrist to elbow... ...I’m researching how much ibuprofen you need to overdose... ...I wish I’d never existed. I hate reality. I hate society."
yes,I recently tried an iboga flood dose but ended up vomiting and could not complete the whole therapy. I would like to know if anyone has tried this method to treat dysthymia.
no,http://imgur.com/a/j94YLah
yes,This is so painful and everything seems to be meaningless. I wish I was never born. I feel so alone and desperate...
yes,"I wasn’t crying myself to sleep as much or feeling the pit in my stomach as badly. However never did I get happier? ...I’m still anhedonic, I just handle it with a better attitude now. ...I’ve eliminated my negative emotions but since I’m immune to positive ones… I’m just empty. Apathetic. ...I can’t get high from drugs. Well I do get side effects such as sleepiness or mental confusion and fog from drugs, but not once have I ever felt a pleasurable high. It’s like my anhedonia has no limits."
yes,Having dysthymia is like being half paralyzed.. because you can not completely drown into these thoughts and still you can not go on without them. It's tiring and unfair. To feel like you can't go on but your body can. ... I know I can not fight it nor stop it.. my attempts to adjust are ridiculous I know.. ... I feel all my work is crushed and that I could never be whole. It feels like a worm is eating me slowing and i know i'm being eaten.
yes,"A hopless feeling of 'What's the point?' and negative thoughts about myself and life flood me. It's frustrating, because I DO have so much to look forward to... and then its almost Noon, and I berate myself for the rest of the day for being lazy and ungrateful"
yes,I’ve had dysthymia for 13 years
yes,"I have a low mood or feel numb, I rarely feel generally happy or content... I haven't showered in over a month, but I finally was able to shower tonight."
yes,"I’ve been struggling with severe insomnia for the last 3-4 years, and of course also struggling mentally. I’m prone to isolate and avoid social interactions."
yes,"I feel like I don't want to fight anymore and have feelings of freedom in my own apathy. My PSD has spiraled into hatred, apathy and general mistrust for others. I thought I was the broken human. Now that I have a better opinion of my self, I completely despise and hate the people around me. I'm in some sort of cognitive dissonance and I'm just confused."
yes,"I've enjoyed sadness for 20 years now and even though I started taking escitalopram since 2019, this hovering melancholy still feels better because it feels familiar."
yes,I wasn't expecting to feel a little relief at finally having a name to call what I've been feeling all these years. It feels like the first step towards getting it together and learn to live a more functional life.
yes,I'm trying to make friends despite the social anxiety that the pandemic turned up to 11. I'm just so tired. I'm trying to not give up. I exercise. I sleep. I have hobbies. I'm happily married. I fucking *meditate.* And my life is still going nowhere and the well of 'keep trying' is so depleted that I want to put a bag over my head.
yes,"I was diagnosed with Dysthymia two weeks ago, and have since medically withdrawn from school... I'm now extremely anxious thinking about how I'm going to spend my time... For the past few years, it's been incredibly difficult to enjoy anything..."
yes,3 different antidepressants haven't yielded positive results.  Talk therapy helps.
no,I believe it will happen 🙏🏽
no,Like the Guinness ad says “good things come to those who wait”. Your sheer optimism is already a good way to see things! Slainte!
no,Thank you for commenting! I am rooting for you too!
yes,"I’m not feeling a difference from it (or at least it seems, I don’t know)"
yes,you want to half-ass everything because you have deep-rooted faith that your life will sort itself out but at the same time you’re also exhausted by every little thing and question how others can do it and that you can only cling on day to day
yes,"I feel shame, hate, anger and frustration towards myself every day but that's how I feel about humanity in general. I have some friends and acquaintances but no true or close friends because I just hate people. I think that my overall hate and disgust for our species plays a huge part in how I view myself and the shame I feel for just being here."
yes,I’ve been feeling pretty fucked up in the head the past week. I keep coming around to this thought: I should not be married anymore.
yes,"the energy required to be a functional person is simply too much. i manage to make it to my full time job every day, but nearly all my meals are delivery because cooking is too much effort. i just eat junk all the time and spend money on useless shit - i guess weed, primarily. i’m just stuck trying to fill the void and it’s completely wrecking my finances. i’m an adult, i should be able to take care of myself, but instead i’m just a pathetic person basically living like a 6 year old. i just want to die."
yes,I struggle a lot with depression and social anxiety...I couldn't get out of bed and stayed in my dorm smoking weed all day. I didn't attend classes and nearly failed...I still feel depressed...I feel lost in life...I have a lack of motivation and I feel depressed...It lasts for months and years at a time.
yes,"I feel the loneliness and alienation. I imagine that if I'm able to perfectly crystalize and articulate what I'm experiencing, that I'll finally expose some hitherto hidden and faulty assumption I hold about the world or about myself, which someone, my therapist most likely, can then logic me out of believing and then I'll be all better."
yes,I still feel this existential blah feeling. I don't really know what happy/normal feels like so it's ultra confusing to know if the medication is working well enough or if I should try something else.
yes,"I wish that I wish that I was suicidal and at the same time I look at my life and evaluate if the cost outweighs the benefit to myself. It's not making actions time, or anywhere near that. With the ptsd, I have had a couple of ideas flash..."
yes,"I have tried everything conventional, I am beginning to suspect if it is not caused by some metabolic pathology. I'm thinking thyroid disorder or some hormonal disorder."
yes,I still suffer from dysthymia
yes,"I still get those crushing waves of sadness/feeling of nothingness, but it's just not the same as it used to and not as often. I feel a bit less hopeless, a bit less lost in the dark, since I stopped drinking"
yes,i'm a functional alcoholic
yes,"I tend to become very solemn or even very depressed whilst drinking... I just become super affectionate and lovey, but not in a hyper way. Just wanna cuddle and be babied and stuff"
yes,Don’t mess with it much since starting antidepressants.
yes,"I was kinda in a suicidal mood last friday, ... numb empty and emotionless now, ... a little voice in my head is telling that I shouldnt go down that road"
yes,"maladaptive daydreaming called, said there is no room for any other addiction except for her and her sisters: super loud music, video games and anime"
yes,Around 180mL pure alcohol every night (e.g. 1.5L wine @12 vol-%) as a high-functioning drinker.
yes,I find since starting Cipralex I can feel more anxious the next day. Before that I would avoid drinking if I wasn't stable and it was making my depression worse.
yes,it worsens the mood
yes,I used to drink a lot but It was becoming a problem
yes,Alcohol used to help boost my mood greatly when I was in my teens and early 20s. It gave me energy and motivation and socializing was fun on it . Then it stopped working and all that happens now is I get tired and sluggish on it
yes,"I relied on drink to feel any joy or peace... Life without drink means I am no longer unwell most of the time, but 6 years of sobriety has been an ordeal in itself...everything seems pointless, futile, unrewarding and tiresome."
yes,"it silences the negativity in my head, at least for the night. Of course it only gets worse the day after. Which you can buzz out by doing it again, thus starting that cycle. It is horrible and im scared of that path i entered..."
yes,"After many failed friendships, I finally accepted that most, if not the majority of people will never understand nor take you as you are because of this illness. If on some days I feel kind of « happy » it’s like now I’m « normal », I am « cured » and God forbid I relapse, it’s my fault. I chose this, I chose to be a burden because what I’m feeling (or not feeling) is too annoying."
yes,"I've suffered from depression my entire life... I honestly until this week couldn't describe the feeling of happy accurately... I'd describe it as functionally depressed... The fog is gone, and I feel amazing. I feel happy. I get a normal emotional spectrum from top to bottom and not just bottom to middle."
yes,"the side effects are kicking me hard rn, I guess i’m just curious if the effect is even going to be worth it after all this waiting and extra suffering"
yes,"I been going through a real rough patch of depression, and my response is to back away from everything and everyone."
yes,I feel like life is completely unenjoyable and I should stop existing... Sometimes dysthymia defies logic; you're depressed for no reason. Anyone else feel the same?
yes,"I ended up hallucinating and a voice telling me to jump out of the window among other things, really scary experience."
yes,"I was diagnosed around 16 years old...I was hospitalized for the first time because of SI and SH. My grades tanked, I started ditching mandatory auditions and missing assignments out of fear I would fail...I had to settle on stagecraft and design if I wanted to stay in the school...I had some vain hope within me that I was going to be released in time to make the audition...I stopped going to my vocal and dance lessons, and fell into a thick cloud of dissociation that hung over my mind throughout most of my high-school years...I couldn't let myself grieve the loss of my creative life and potential, so I blocked it all out for years and years. I even forgot about my talents completely...I feel the pain of my inner adolescent now, so strongly that tears are in my eyes as I type...I wonder if anyone else feels this too, the pain and grief of knowing who you could have been if you weren't diagnosed and suffering with dysthymia."
yes,"I definitely have a eating disorder of some kind. In my mind I hate food, I seriously mean this. If I could just take a pill that gave me all the calories I would. Whenever I have to eat in public I don't eat hardly anything, even if I super hungry. Its a mental barrier I cannot cross. In the presence of family though I eat a gluttonous amount, there's no way to sugar coat it. My portions are out of control, as well as the frequency of snacking throughout the day."
yes,"Had to take two doses just to get out of bed today, despite wearing my CPAP all night and getting plenty of sleep. And here I am now, drinking coffee with a resting heart rate of 95 bpm, but still fighting the urge to go back to bed since I'm still mentally drained and feel like I'm about to fall asleep."
yes,"My mind felt like a fuzz that couldn't choose one way to feel. I became apathetic, put on the false front, escaped through school and work...I had dysthymia-- talking to people, focusing, having a self-esteem to talk to people."
no,I want to help a friend by taking her to a psychiatrist. I'm wondering if it's ok to take her to my psychiatrist.
yes,"feeling like a zombie or just having those 'worse' days... misplacing little things like keys, wallet"
yes,Everything does. No real hobbies or interests.
yes,"Numb, **angry**, *tired*, alone, **worthless**... Cold. ... Most of the time i feel physically numb. like my sense of touch has been dialled down to 75% and ability to react reduced to 10%. The only feelings that i can truly recognise in myself (outside of the brief bursts of joy) are anger, resentment, frustration, disgust at the world around me and self hate. ... I feel ashamed and that i don't talk to anyone. i rarely talk to my parents, I want to talk to my Grandma ... I just cant do it. ... Every time i come out of my escape, the real world slowly becomes more and more unbearable. My thoughts become darker and darker and my breaking point draws nearer and nearer as i feel the pent up rage and frustration starting to boil over."
yes,"I go to bed at 4am and wake up at 11am/12pm, and stay in bed awake and in the dark for hours, sometimes falling asleep again, sometimes until 4pm or even 6pm. ... Mornings have become some sort of phobia. ... if I have to stay awake, I start ruminating and all my physical symptoms get a lot worse. ... I get really anxious days before."
yes,"I take bupropion, it doesn't have these side effects at all, but at the same time it doesn't help me in any way."
yes,"Sometimes it just feels like my brain was crafted to be my own special torture device... The thought process is toxic and ruminating on it certainly isn't helping me or my mood, but I can't help it. It's like a chemical compulsion for my brain to make me miserable."
yes,"I'm just watching myself do things on autopilot and letting the other voices in my head dictate what our agenda of the day would be. ... Feeling so detached from it like it's not my own experience or emotions, but rather another person's. When I try to recall what they did, it's so far away, too. A big 'that's not me- I don't feel connected to it' even though it looks like it was me"
yes,"Stopped vaping, reduced the xanax by a lot and stopped taking unisom.  Turns out one or a combination of these was causing my eating disorder.  I haven't had any late night binges for a couple of weeks and I'm down eight pounds."
yes,"I can't focus properly...I have experienced most of the side effects like constipation, nausea and the worst one was skin picking. I destroyed my skin barrier. My skin hurts...It's red, inflamed and sore."
yes,"I have comorbid anxiety and PTSD. My main depressive symptoms are anxiety, agitation, kognitive dysfunction, and either low or numb mood. I was suicidal or had panic attacks, but buproprion enhanced my emotions and had a positive benefit on my memory and motivation, but also enhanced my anxiety."
yes,"I've always felt a little off, like I can feel happiness when I'm doing something I'm interested in; Going to events, seeing friends, etc. But on the whole I just have a neutral outlook on the day to day, like an emptiness... I don't wake up thinking ah today is going to be a good day ever. When I'm not distracted by something I just tend to stare off into the void. And while I'm not suicidal, I've always just been apathetic, even fine with the idea of just suddenly dropping dead. The thought of leaving my kid deters it, but it's still there."
yes,I've been going through a rough patch this last 10 months or so and that's when I discovered that I probably have dysthymia (therapist wouldn't diagnose me but she did say I have mild depression and pretty bad anxiety).  ...it was 0 to 100 instantly.
yes,expressing the way I really feel sometimes
yes,"During the past four months I have been sitting down on a white sofa, listening to tuned music with a web of electrodes glued to my scalp for thirty minutes at a time with my eyes closed. After each of these sessions I arose from my seat and witnessed as all my problems ebbed to the distance, single file. First the dissociative disorder. Then the mood swings. Then my sleep improved. Then she added behavioral facilitation, because I need it. Then the ADHD went away. Finally the voice in my head telling me of endless failure and dreams of death had gone mute. I acquired energy. And then I felt happy for the first in all my life, just being alive."
yes,"I've spent almost 20 years in an abusive relationship with myself because of this stupid condition. I am struggling to come to terms with it tbh. I have hated myself for so long that I don't know if I can find the strength to love myself enough to begin fixing myself. I can't seem to stick to the anti-depressents cause my apathy kicks in big time. On top of that I smoke way to much in order to just feel a little better, but am obviously just making things worse. I feel like such a massive failure."
yes,I feel I have a super low expectation for life to the point that I don’t really get disappointed much. I also don’t feel super frustrated when I’m isolated or when I fail at something.
yes,"I’m really nervous to have to be vulnerable in a group setting, it’s something I’ve always struggled with."
yes,I'm not able to really enjoy anything or have meaningful experiences. I'm in college right now and it seems like everyone around me is having the time of their lives... I feel like I'm just here. I'm just existing. ...it feels like another situation where I'm just *there*. It doesn't mean anything to me and it's frustrating because I see so many girls whose sorority means the world to them.
yes,"I've been like this since teenagehood...I used to be really into certain genres of music...I don't care about anything, I neglect myself a lot...I feel comfortable in this mess"
yes,"Got in a really bad place over the past 2 weeks, to the point where I wrote goodbye letters yesterday and sorta had a plan. Everything just feels pretty hopeless, this world feels so doomed and I don’t want to be a part of it. My personal life feels pretty doomed as well, but I guess if I had the will power and hope in humanity I could still make it into something, it just feels so pointless."
yes,"I was diagnosed back in 2008 with dysthemia, I have good days and bad but im full abled adult, fully independent, live alone, self employed, drive. I never had thoughts of hurting myself"
yes,"I've been in a big slump, feeling pretty consistently depressed for the last 2-3 months, and I was having several emotional meltdowns/anxiety episodes... I'm TRYING not to sabotage myself... my mood has seemed to taper back down over the course of this second week on Desvenlafaxine, and on top of that, my stomach has felt kind of gross and unsettled and extra hungry, and my body just feels off. I want so desperately to feel not so depressed."
yes,"It's fucking agonizing just not being able to find the drive to do stuff, and then feeling like a lazy piece of shit for not doing said stuff. Dysthymia is just like a never ending cycle of self-hate yet at the same time, not wanting to get better."
yes,"I wasn't feeling almost anything, I'm starting to believe that my emotions are broken, I only can feel angry in a meaningful way, all the other emotions are just grey and blurry.... I think this could be part of the reason why my dysthymia periods are getting longer and longer, I think I'm just stretching to the limit my sadness"
no,I have had dysthymia for my entire life past three years old. I was diagnosed with a ton of shit at the age of six and medicated at 4 years old. I was hospitalized when I was 16. I am 18 now.
yes,"I feel like I'm living a completely different life than everyone else. I feel like I shouldn't feel this way. I see other people enjoying their relationships and their loves and it makes me so jealous... my appetite is so shit (never eat, most food is disgusting to me), my sleep is so shit (12+ hours, cant get out of bed). i can't get myself to participate in my hobbies despite reminders that I need to practice daily. i don't really enjoy doing them either. but i feel bad when i don't. school is starting again and everything feels impossible."
yes,"I'm a lazy worm, i'm only living in my mind, on the outside i can't do anything, i always fail, i'm sluggish, can't keep taking care of me, i still don't have a job, i feel like i can't do anything, i feel inferior to everyone, i feel ugly and handicapped, meds not working anymore, i get overwhelmed and just sleep, i feel lost and a burden, i hate myself."
yes,"Recently had a friend open up to me about wanting to hurt himself, I did what I could to help but I feel the weight of his emotions on top of mine all the time."
yes,"I dont care about anything, and that's not gonna change."
yes,My doctor recently diagnosed me with Dysthymia after 10+ years of dealing with depression symptoms. I'm also dealing with the 'well crap this is the rest of my life.'
yes,I feel like an absolute failure... I genuinely hate myself.
yes,I don’t want to do this. I’m hesitant to drop out because idk what I *do* want to do because I don’t want to do anything ever. ...I have tried many 8+ medications and am at the point where I feel they don’t work for me...
yes,"I don't feel things as strongly, that numbness is just so familiar... I've been basically sad, frustrated and a bunch of other feelings for the past 2 weeks. I'm just letting the numbness in because I can't handle these extreme feelings for this long..."
yes,"I have had problems with motivation, often feeling that I am much less hard working than I could be... I think my lack of attraction could be related to depression. ...I am worried because the last 3-4 days I have had no appetite at all and this has never happened to me before."
yes,"I want to have people be understanding and to lend an ear. For context, I come from an Asian household where in older generations especially, things like depression aren’t looked at as an actual illness. Usually they’d go off on a “during my time” rant and sweep everything under the rug."
yes,"Dysthymia had diff'rent plans, Sapped all my energy. I try to numb with drink. I can only count my failings, Leaving joy diminished. I know what I want to do, No dopamine to do it. I'm stuck in a miasma, A debilitating muck. Cocooning in a coffin, Just waiting to be dead."
yes,"Received a diagnosis of ADHD about a year ago - although the doc mentioned that depression was a possibility too. I think my depression fits into the classic dythymia mold (that's not self-diagnosis, also a real doctor's). I rarely get *very* depressed. But struggle constantly with shifting a mild blanket of negativity and hopelessness that I can't help but notice doesn't affect my peers."
yes,"I feel sick and gross... can’t sleep... I keep thinking about random stuff, how my life is going, how shit everything is… it feels like everything is just weighing on me and all I wanna do is sleep… but I can’t shake this feeling…"
yes,I’ve been missing school for about 3 weeks now because of my depression
no,"Hi all, I can’t help but feel that we could all benefit from creating a space for people with dysthymia to chat. I know we can do that here but Reddit offers a limited format. Would anyone be open to joining a discord server if I created one? Edit: looks like I’m definitely making one. I’ll hopefully get to it sometime this week. If not, this weekend."
yes,"I'm currently studying the dysthymia hypothesis concerning myself. I'll see a psychiatrist soon for many reasons concerning a depressive mood for years, two deep depressive episodes, anxiety and other stuff. I often feel guilty because of these moments, either because I think that I am not allowed to have fun, or because I think that I am not legitimate to complain about what I would call depressive moods. Sometimes I'm not even sad or anything, I'm just bored. I'm deeply nihilistic concerning myself and the world... and yet I can have fun sometimes, but I know inside of me that it's just to fill in the void, and that boredom will always be there because nothing material seems to be able to fill that void."
yes,"I feel like people calling dysthymia ""mild"" depression and less severe feels oddly insulting. I find that people sometimes don't take my diagnosis seriously and don't recognize how debilitating and painful it is to live with it. I feel like my depression is seen as less serious and even family members have dismissed it by saying it's just low mood."
yes,I've gone through tough moments and sometimes I'm hit with a particular wave of sadness and boredom...I had a major breakdown during an internship...I've had a slight problem with gaslighting myself...I haven't been doing all that great and it feels like this wave has been way too long...I feel like it's too serious and too real and I'm never going to be able to handle it...I didn't work hard enough to learn everything I need to be even remotely competent at that job so why should I even try when there are people I'm sure are better suited for it...I spent the last month overthinking everything and not being able to do anything about it...I've only gotten worse...I spiraled and turned and connected this with other things...I have no self worth and self confidence issues...it affects how I connect with people and how I talk...I couldn't bring myself to do it and I gaslight myself into thinking my answer was wrong and stupid...This is how this issue usually is but since the incident last week it's been way worse and I can't go a day without crying and having some really not nice let's not talk about it thoughts.
yes,"i live with 2 Hydes... they start drinking and the transformations begin, the figth with me and each other. i manage to defend myself and now I pretty much ignore them."
yes,"i usually wake up with a depressed mood and feel terribly sad until late afternoon. Afterwards, and especially in the evening, I may feel really good and almost forget my sorrow in the morning."
yes,I’ve been dysthymic and anxious since I can remember and my symptoms are only getting worse as I get more hopeless about my condition ever improving.
yes,"I feel empty, depression gets worse when I feel insecure or unstable with friendships, my mood depends on my friendships, and I'm scared that this feeling won't go away"
yes,"I was recently diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and it makes so much sense. ive been depressed for years, since I was in middle school and I am now in college. It’s back to being bad tho, after being diagnosed with herpes. I just want to know if it ever gets better? I’m so so tired, I truly don’t have it in me. I am constantly anxious and afraid and I just feel like I’m going to be like this for the rest of my life and if that’s the case, what’s the point?"
yes,cold weather is when I’m super depressed
yes,lethargic as fuck
yes,"every year summer I got really depressed, can’t rest well and getting tired all the time"
no,Very common for all people. Not just those with dysthymia. The homicide rate greatly increases in the summer.
yes,"I felt depression in worst way from April to August. On Aprils actually, i felt totally desperate."
yes,Summers are usually when I’m the most depressed.
yes,I get so tired and lethargic.
yes,my mood has been absolutely awful. It usually is once it gets really hot.
yes,"I feel groggy, heavy, and uncomfortable, I lose sleep and feel tired all the time."
yes,it makes my mood so much worse I genuinely dread hot weather
yes,I live where it's 30-35c for half the year and humid. Every dry /cool season I feel my mood lift.
yes,Lack of sunlight has always been very painful for me
no,I would be melting in that sort of heat! How do you sleep?
no,Lots of fans and just time to get used to it. I usually love to cuddle under about four layers of blankets in the winter but now all I can use is a sheet. Ughhh and we still have two and a half months left of hot weather.
yes,"I'm a perma-tired, terminally online bitter person with health problems that ruined my life, I'm sick of people... I don't want to discuss meds anymore, I've tried like 6, it's over... And it is what it is, life sucks."
yes,Today I opened my eyes and I knew. By the way the room felt changed when it wasn't. The way my eyes saw but I didn't. How i now close my phone and sleep for hours. How I once again would fancy to be... gone.
yes,"I couldnt answer because i dont do anything. I go to therapy, i barely attend the support groups, i missed 2 days of when i was in partial hospitalization, i couldn't even go to school. The only reason i graduated was because i transfered to all the work being online and kept up to date with assignments and got high scores on tests. I dont even look at the DBT book she got me. I just dont have the energy to because i haven't done jack shit to better myself. I barely even keep up with hygiene and all i do is lay in my room. This is the second antidepressant that's stopped working for me after i maxxed out the dosage."
yes,"I ended up severely numbing out... It's the place where even moving a hand or finger takes every ounce of motivation you try to muster up. Of course, making it very hard to function, particularly when caught in a public place."
yes,"I’m just so tired and... empty. All the time. I keep thinking my next stage of life, or next week, or next XYZ, it will get better. Somehow, I will get... not even happy, I don’t need to be happy. Just more present, less of a shell with a oozy center."
yes,"I struggle in the ways that most of you on this subreddit have mentioned countless times before. I feel like I am never content with what I have, and not because I want more, but because this just isn't what a want. ... like my soul is itching, like my spirit is clawing at itself to get out and find where it belongs, like it doesn't fit in this cage that is my body. ... knowing how simple my wants are but how impossible they seem to reach for no particular reason. It feels like the universe is mounted against me. ... I just can't feel it. Any gratitude I have is drowned by the unhappiness I feel and the existential dread I encounter every time I go to work ..."
yes,It feels like I don’t have a “why” and that’s what I’m missing.
yes,"For people with mental health illness/es, this is the worst possible time—limited to no access to meds, therapists, and other forms of help... Having dysthymia is difficult. It's almost impossible to tell if you're having an attack. And when you're inside the mist, you're stuck (mentally) between doing something and not doing anything at all... There's this fear that comes with it—that if you take action and then it turns out that you just misidentified and the attack is over, that action cannot be undone... So you're in a tug of war between your brain and yourself."
yes,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and dysthymia when I was 18. ...I remember always doubting myself and not believing myself back in elementary school. ...I feel like I bring everyone else down. ...The curse part is when I hurt…I hurt a lot. It’s easy for people to hurt me. ...my mind tends to wander to the bad and hopelessness that’s in it more often than not."
yes,"I have no connection to my surroundings, I feel distant and detached from my surroundings. I feel nothing when I look around just a state of nothingness. I don't even feel the presence of my friend it's a strange horrible feeling."
yes,"I feel like I'm in a well with smooth walls lined in oil and petroleum jelly. And all of my efforts or any of my efforts are for nothing. And it doubles down. Try as I may to climb out, I just slip deeper and deeper into its belly until only a pinprick of light is visible, if that. And when I'm there, anything that happens (or doesn't happen) is just a confirmation that I can never be enough, that the world is this cruel place and I'm traveling this journey alone."
yes,"I have 0 friends and never had a romantic relationship at all, never even came close it, and i dont really understand why"
yes,"I fell back into a depressive episode. I don't want to do the things I used to love, I just can't get myself to do them. I'm also a bit scared of myself, how easily I can pretend everything is fine. I feel horrible and empty and I don't wanna do anything. I have trouble getting out of bed and ready for work but I'm not allowed to call in sick anymore."
yes,I've cried almost everyday for the past two weeks - sometimes from small triggers and sometimes from recurring thoughts. I'm starting to think that it'll always be like this - me chasing things in life and not being fully satisfied once I get there. I'm scared I'll never be able to have a normal relationship. I feel like I'm always battling myself and I'm getting so tired. I've lost interest in pretty much everything. I'm scared. My parents are doing the absolute most for me but it feels like my mind just wants me to die and I'm waiting for the day. I don't know how I'm going to live like this. Every day seems like a damn chore... uni stresses me out. Work and the thought of my future seem bleak - I don't know how I'll function in society living like this.
yes,"I start each morning immediately wishing I was dead and thinking about all the ways in which I could cease to exist and how nice it would be not to. ... I'll have a few moments throughout the day where it dips, like when I'm waiting for a train and all I can think about is stepping off the platform. ... When it's time for bed, all the anxiety washes over me and it takes forever for me to fall asleep and there's no more day to physically distract me. ... The worst part though, is when things go wrong in a day, like conflict with my partner or family, or doing something wrong with work or things I needs to be responsible about, I always spiral naturally into suicidal ideation. ... I feel that way right now. And I know it's wrong and I feel so guilty about it."
yes,"feeling somewhat good and optimistic to again succumb to lethargy, pessimism and feeling powerless"
yes,"Ran out of the house and was running on the road in a frenzy... almost knocked down by a taxi... figured everything seemed so damn bleak already so I should just jump from the 7th floor... I called up a friend and asked him if he had some H... Went back home, and I called my youngest brother and started getting angry... I fell into a deep, deep abyss of hopelessness and emptiness... couldn't get out of bed... started drinking... cut myself and poured rubbing alcohol over it... I also had burn marks from cigarettes... staring blankly at the wall... I fell into another episode, I called SOS..."
yes,"I'm not being able to pursue dreams, goals, or anything that takes more than a week to get done. At first, I thought: 'There must be something wrong with me. I must be the laziest person in existence'. Then, today, I talked to my psychiatrist and she pointed out that it may be the old depression kicking in again. So, hello old friend r/dysthymia"
no,"So recently i have been doing ""better"" , im trying to figure out what i enjoy and makes me happy. I have like $150 in gift cards and i just dont know what to spend it on. Any suggestions would be appreciated. It may just help my train of thought, or even what you would do with $150 in gift cards.  Thank you."
yes,"my mood constantly changes between slightly content and slightly depressed. But overall there is just this sense of hopelessness and meaninglessness. I have basically came to the conclusion that my problems will truly never fix themself. Therefore I’m stuck living with them for life... I feel like a speck in time just watching life pass by because I know nothing truly matters... life feels very empty... It feels like I’m just sort of waiting for it to end... To make things worse, I don’t have anyone to communicate these ideas with and it feels isolating."
yes,"I was given a brief screener and then was told 'Good news - you don't have depression!' Which, I don't know, just totally messed with me because I was diagnosed off of a brief screener that wasn't even geared towards dysthymia. No other questions, and when I started crying she seemed flabbergasted as to why I was upset."
yes,im contemplating quitting my job and death sounds good right about now. i haven’t been exercising because i’ve been working long shifts at work and i go home just to sleep so i can start work the next day.
yes,"I think part of it is living in a capitalist society that marks success by what you do for a living. As if being able to get out of bed and go to work is our main purpose and how our success as a human is measured. Of course not going to work, or taking care of basic hygiene is going to create a new set of problems that will make life more difficult, but being able to get to work doesn’t mean you are necessarily hurting less than someone who isnt."
yes,"I've struggled with depression since around the age of 11. It's stopped the severity of the depression, and calmed down my anxiety. But I really wish I had a medication that would stop me being so tired all the time! Honestly I think maybe I don't lack motivation I am just too damn tired to do more than next to nothing and sleep. I went to sleep at midnight last night, work up at 8:30am. By 2:30pm I was struggling to keep my eyes open and just wanted to sleep. I cancelled plans because I just did not have the energy, and the guilt of cancelling is now meaning I don’t just experience fatigue but anxiety and stupid thoughts about myself."
yes,"I'm 23 now, and I've been a rather sad, retreated type of guy my whole life. I do not go out of my way to do anything but the bare minimum in any aspect of my life... I feel like there's a version of me out there who would enjoy certain things, but not me. I'm just lying on a sofa."
yes,I felt I so used to sadness that sometimes I don't have proportional feelings! The worse thing is that sometimes nothing happens and I feel miserable without any clear reason.
no,"Hello everyone, ... (entire text)"
yes,I despise myself so much I'm constantly running away from me. No part of me is good and every part of me is despicable. There's nothing in me that I can truly love and respect. Everything about me is worthless and useless
yes,"I have been haunted by Dysthymia symptoms since about 2017. Very low energy levels and fatigue, general bad mood, easily angered, little interest in my hobbies, decreased social life, brain fog, trouble concentrating and decreased sex drive and wanting to be touched in general."
yes,"I was always sitting in my room, on my bed laying around either daydreaming or being existential... I didn’t join any clubs in high school because I had extreme social anxiety and irrational thoughts that I would hurt people... My brain is fried after years of emotional and psychological abuse from family and friends... I’m extremely bored out of my mind... I want people in my life but they scare me. I want to go out in nature but fear getting lost... I want family but I don’t want to see them too much because my social battery is so low... I want to be a creative but I’m too lazy to practice my skills... I want a job but I also don’t want to deal with seeing ppl i know while working."
yes,"I slowly faze in and out of dysthymia episodes... I already have a fearful attachment style... I have a chronic fear of abandonment... I’ve been a mess since the break, can’t eat, sleep or get out of bed most days..."
yes,That overwhelming desire to drop where you stand and just sit... Just go limp and pretend you don't exist for a while.
yes,"I keep my mouth shut, pretend everything is ok."
no,I'm gonna make 2024 the year of oversharing for me!
yes,I haven’t told anyone but a family member knows that I have some form of depression. I’ve found it really doesn’t help to talk to friends about depression to any extent unless they are knowledgeable about it . Very few people will understand dysthyMia and if you try to explain it you will most likely get some terrible advice
yes,"I got PDD and OCD out of it instead, ... My therapist keeps harping on my OCD and I'm like ma'am can we please focus on my consistent lack of will to survive"
yes,"I told one cousin who's the same age as me. She's the only one I'm 'closest' to, and I told her just because she's a worrywart over me."
yes,"I struggle with depression, but they don't know how much I suffer from it"
yes,i overshare if somebody even asks
yes,Not close to family and don't have close friends
yes,"therapist, school counselor, parents"
yes,"I've been experiencing strong dysthymia since about March. I'm in a state of recovery. On the plus side, a few years of therapy finally paid off and I'm able see the patterns that got me here, which will hopefully make it easier to rebound."
yes,"I don't know if I want to be better. maybe I don't deserve it, or maybe I'm not capable enough to be better."
yes,"I got diagnosed with dysthymia... I’ve noticed I go into little episodes of ‘mania’... I quitted therapy... I thought this was just a symptom of dysthymia, and well last night I found ‘manic episodes’ isn’t a symptom of dysthymia."
yes,I was suffering from Dysthymia and double depression since I was 15 years old. I tried everything... At 40 it became unmanageable.
yes,I don't think I really know what to avoid saying when my fiance has his depressive days/moments. He was diagnosed with dysthymia several years ago...
no,"I have had dysthymia for over a decade. However my ability to handle intrusive thoughts has improved vastly. I trust myself a lot more and have learned so much on my search for inner peace, living with this illness."
yes,"Diagnosed with Dysthymia, GAD, SAD, ADHD, currently medicated and breaking down. Having depersonalization, maybe some derealization, and a bout of depression along with mild visual distortions and inability to mentally focus and a hard time remembering. I'm starting to experience depersonalization. I think I started seeing visual distortions too."
yes,"I was sadistically abused by my mother during my childhood (ages from 5 to 9). I am diagnosed with dysthymia. My sagging mood causes me to avoid school, work, and the collective, and activates a subconscious belief that I don't deserve anything nice. I find it difficult to socialize and make friends."
yes,I could definitely understand and relate to his state of mind
yes,"I have been assessed to have low to moderate depression by both my primary doctor and my therapist, and have probably had it for over a decade. ...my work has been suffering a lot as I have progressively been getting worse. ...I keep failing at reaching my goals... I don't want to feel like a failure again. I had to quit my previous job due to my depression..."
yes,i’m very afraid of not being in control of my faculties; i don’t like drugs or even being drunk.
yes,I like dysthymiacs personally. Like the label insomniac but dysthymia
yes,My mother in particular has not been looking at it with the seriousness it deserves... She has a habit of nitpicking on problems and I find that this consistently feeds into my vulnerabilities and anxiety... I tend to get annoyed and asks her why she keeps trying to bring up issues... I usually just get myself out of this situation by just shutting myself in the room and blasting music...
yes,I go through periods where things are ok but then sometimes I’ll delve into a depression... I don’t really have any goals and I can’t see my life going anywhere. Even I constantly feel like I have this grey cloud over me
yes,"I started with a new psychiatrist and was just diagnosed with dysthymia after feeling incredibly numb for my entire life. I’ve always assumed I was just different from everyone else. Maybe on the autism spectrum or something. Nope, chronic depression that was bestowed upon me by my incredibly toxic family."
yes,"I don’t enjoy anything. No matter what I do, I can’t get myself to believe that I can ever feel happy again. There are quick moments where I can be present and happy; however, those are exclusively aided by alcohol or weed. I feel so guilty that I can spend hours with people while thinking about wishing I were at home."
yes,"I am unable to fulfill basic task that my coworkers are easily capable of. Specifically fast paced productivity. I've read that this kind of work can be impossible for people with dysthymia. I do the best I can at work but I always fall short. I would say it's my employer but it's been the last 3 jobs I've had. The best way I can possibly describe putting effort into a job is like a body builder, realizing he can't physically lift anymore weight. That he is outside of his capable genetic boundary. Despite that he just proceeds to abuse himself, and try harder. Only to fail everytime."
yes,all it takes is an unfortunate childhood and now I have to feel this way for the rest of my life
yes,being dead but you still have to go to work and pretend you're fine
yes,"mood...constant slightly below zero. Sometimes peaks go down, but almost never up"
yes,"Depression is like being underwater and trying to breathe. ... Bipolar people are either underwater really deep or they are flying in the air like Icarus with hastily-made wings. ... Dysthymia now called PDD, Persistent Depressive Disorder, are treading water for years and they occasionally fall deep underwater."
yes,our neutral mode is below average
yes,feels like i'm never satisfied. No matter what i accomplish there's no true fulfillment. Despite being productive that depressive state never truly leaves.
no,1/10 would not recommend
yes,"It feels like life is not worth it and I always was chasing anything that gave me any sense of happiness in the moment... Things like sex, food, TV, books."
yes,"The lows may not be as bad as major depression, but it lasts longer. The depressive slums are more persistent."
yes,It physically hurts. ...having no energy or ability to concentrate on things you want or need to do. It's like being chronically ill...
yes,Happiness is not everyone's default state
yes,"Feels like most days is just surviving/existing. You simply are, without the joie de vivre."
yes,You feel exhaustion in your bones.
yes,"Having dysthymia means your “neutral” is a 4- this means your sad state is depressing and your depressing state is extremely low, whereas your happy is a 5 and your hyper is a 6."
yes,"dysthymia is like being at a 1-2 all the time. You can function, but at a lower level than a 'normal' person. Doing basic things takes all your effort."
yes,It's like wearing a mask whenever I'm around people. There's people all around me and not one of them care about me or even acknowledge my existence. It's like everything good in life is just on the tip of my fingers. I can touch it but I just can't grab it for myself.
yes,a wound that won't kill you but never heals and almost never stops aching
yes,I felt like I was a dead person walking
no,"Hear, hear!"
yes,Sometimes it's :| And sometimes it's :(
no,That’s so accurate
no,Yup.
no,But it’s almost never :)
yes,"Back on Wellbutrin XR after a break for a few years. Just kinda slowly crept back. Never debilitating, always just /there/."
yes,I get paralyzing anger at stupid things and go on deranged rants about the causes of these things. I just pace around my room hitting myself/hitting my head against the wall every time I think about that stuff.
yes,I’ve been struggling with dysthymia for almost 10y now and I always felt that I was the odd one out - it’s not really the kind of depression people know about and they don’t really understand the symptoms.
yes,currently having a major depressive episode... struggling with urges to self harm... just want to give up...
yes,I've been so depressed for so long. I just wanna get better man but they won't let me.
yes,"I think I'm afraid of being seen. Even by pages of paper. As i lay myself bare within those pages shame sneaks in.. and i get cold... I shiver. I've been dealing with my issues. Trying to better myself, trying to heal from things no one around me knows about. And sometimes i wish i could talk about them.. but i know it's too late for that. Somethings are forever mine. Never to be shared. Like how I go back in time and wip that child's tears... how they never seem to stop. How my heart still fears."
yes,I've lost track of time and now it's been a week since I've had a shower. I keep telling myself that I'll take one today and next thing I know it's another day. I just can't do it right now.
yes,"symptoms are still there, but at least for me, most symptoms hit hardest at night time, especially during attempted sleep"
no,Taking 15 minutes to meditate in the morning has been really helpful for me. Even if I do it in bed I find it helps frame my day a little better.
no,walking 10k+ daily. monitored by cheap fitness tracker with alerts to move and dynamic goal setting (it increases the number of steps every day).
no,What kind of meditation do you do? Do you use a guiding app or anything?
no,could you describe how this makes a difference please
no,"I'm going down the path of Tibetan meditation. I recommend Pema Chodron's book ""When Things Fall Apart"" or Tara Brach's ""Radical Acceptance"". I use the app ""insight timer"" on iOS which allows for both silent meditations and tons of guided ones. I'll use the Jack Kornfield ones if I want a quick meditation."
yes,"don't have back pain because of too much sitting, clears my mind when i walk in nature, i was able to keep my weight down"
no,How long does it take to walk that many steps?
no,i never measured. i do it during the entire day. my fitness tracker warns me after 45 minutes of inactivity and i go for a walk in my house or backyard. i also take a longer walk or two during the day mostly with dogs or to do some stuff in the town.
yes,"I went through a lot of pain when I was 12 years old, my father hit me hard, without any mercy, he forgot about my vulnerable age and body, thinking only of correcting “in time”, yes, in time for the trauma, in time when u dont have the necessary resources to face situations as stressful as this, in time to ruin my adolescence and part of my adulthood, in time to give me depressive and anxious disorder, in time to feel dead while alive, in time to live a hell painted with rainbows, in time to lose myself, in time to despise myself, in time to make me go through the greatest pain of my life."
yes,"I really get angry, I want to hit people. I snap so easily, but it doesn't really give me a relief. So I either get so aggressive and yell and stuff or I get that angry that I cry. I think I always had problems when it came to my aggression levels, even as a child and a teen."
yes,I keep remmbing the times when I would try to reach out to my mom and hope she noticed that I'm not okay..... She'd just say 'you did this to yourself' or be dismissive. Yet here I am.... Discovering other ways to self harm. It's been the only thing in my head lately.
no,"In a psychology course while looking into depressive and personality disorders, I was searching through all different forms/systems of therapy, when I came across the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP). From what I gathered, CBASP was specifically designed for treating people with chronic/persistent depression/dysthymia. Studies have shown it is just as effective as antidepressants alone, but when combined with antidepressants, provides significantly higher rates of remission (erasure of symptoms). However, practitioners are rather scarce.

To find one in your area, here is a link. Make sure the therapist(s) you contact are licensed to practice in your state.[https://www.cbasp.org/pro.htm](https://www.cbasp.org/pro.htm)

However, that list is partial. You can contact the CBASP society to get a more complete list by visiting here:[https://www.cbaspsociety.org/cbasp-contact-us.php](https://www.cbaspsociety.org/cbasp-contact-us.php)

And if you are not in the US and require a more complete list, you can contact the CBASP network here: [https://www.cbasp-network.org/index.php/2-uncategorised/39-impressum](https://www.cbasp-network.org/index.php/2-uncategorised/39-impressum)

You can also try and see if there are student/intern/residency therapist who is going into practicing CBASP therapy at hospitals/clinics close by. I hope this helps y'all if you've had issues with psychologists/psychiatrists in the past, as CBASP practitioners are particularly versed in PDD."
yes,"my mood goes low it TANKS. I could be high functioning for the whole day, and then the last few hours have my mood tank horribly for about three days. It comes out of no where and I never see it coming."
yes,"I don't feel capable of maintaining productivity on a constant basis. ...I'm not able to concentrate on any task, hence the unproductivity."
yes,"I bawled my eyes off but now handling it slightly better. She tells me these things with love, but I know they are the wrong things to say, but what can you do? What can I say? Sighhhhhhh."
yes,"I have recently fallen into a depressed state again... I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either... I feel like I can't do it. I have almost no self-esteem, and it's just gotten worse these past few weeks... I feel myself getting even worse, like them not choosing me is a proof of how worthless I really am... I don't know how to manage these increasing bad feelings and at the same time being on the lookout for a new job... I have absolutely no idea. I spend my days wasting away on youtube and reddit, i have no goals or aspirations, and nothing i want to be or do. These thoughts are part of whats fueling the hopelessness."
yes,I need to change my meds but it was sketchy enough for my psych to prescribe adderall for me and I don’t want another doctor to take it away cuz it’s the first thing to actually help me in years.
no,That’s all that’s the post
yes,"I have been living with what I call 'the grey'. A sense, or keen awareness, of the emotions of nothingness, apathy and lack of mood."
yes,relief of a lifetime of Dysthymia
yes,I feel so useless and weak. Why must I have this why doesn’t it stop why do I still bother even trying. I just want everything to go away and to just stop all my feelings. I hate constantly being affected by things going on around me. I just want to be normal
yes,"I am struggling with fatigue over the last few months, every sound or anything else demanding my attention is draining me. Everything is exhausting. I don’t feel any emotions keenly except frustration, anger and tiredness. Even suicide seems like too much effort."
yes,diagnosed with dysthymia
no,I have dysthymia. It sucks. I have been reading a book called [The Half-Empty Heart: A Supportive Guide to Breaking Free from Chronic Discontent](http://www.amazon.com/The-Half-Empty-Heart-Supportive-Discontent/dp/0312307969) and I have found that it has really been helping me. I have yet to start the exercises but I will next month (I have finals coming up and papers). The information it presents sounded weird at first (what I thought was different issues were actually interconnected: my feeling like garbage and my ability to withdraw from feeling).
yes,"i’ve been suffering from chronic depression (my diagnosis)/ dysthymia from as long as i can remember (age 5) and i really just don’t think i’m capable of even experiencing happiness... i am unable to bond with people because i always feel this way... everything just feels so hopeless, everyday is the same loop... i’ve always wanted to end it but could never actually bring myself to it... i mean another factor is that since ive lived like this for so long it’s literally my normal so hence why i haven’t killed myself but ive always fantasied it"
yes,"I can't seem to be excited about anything regarding him... No excitement, no emotion, nothing. I feel guilty and like I'm not enthusiastic the way I should be and that the attachment I generally have for partners isn't there."
yes,"I've lost all interest in anything enjoyable. My coping skills make me feel even worse than I did before I did them. The only way to stop the self hatred and rumination is to smoke weed, but even then, that makes me think I'm lazy."
yes,I could no longer ignore all the hair in the corners and the grime building up in the tub
yes,"I feel very tired all the time and on top of that I have trouble focusing, also I get bored of things extremely quickly, I struggle with attention and concentration and brain fog my whole life, I forget things, I lose things, I lose money (a lot), I cant focus at classes. I cant hold a job, I want to drop out again because I don't know anything about my subject after 4 years of schooling...but if I drop out what would I do? I got two jobs, I quit both after about 3 days. I cant even drive a car. I feel like my world is crushing around me..."
yes,"I've been chronically suicidal for about seven years now. I never felt happy to be alive, the thought of dying young never bothered me. I've been in treatment for about six years now, been to therapy with multiple therapists I liked, and been through a bunch of medications, but nothing's really had much of an effect. I've made three attempts, and I crash and aren't functioning for a few months, before returning to barely functioning."

yes,"The last few years of high school was shit. My first year of college(last year) was shit. This semester is not as bad as last year but it still feels horrible. I think I'm feeling lower than low right now, I still need to finish up assignments that I can get a passing grade but I don't know if I can do it. I really don't want to risk academic dismissal again."
yes,I've been living with Dysthymia since my teens...I just seem to get worse triggered by them...Last time I saw them it triggered a week long spell of depression.
yes,My doctor almost gave up on me. She said if you think it's not working anymore you can stop taking meds. It's not easy to choose another doctor while you don't gives a shit about anything.
yes,"I don't know how it is to be generally happy... I'm just all 'meh :|'. My family told me I never seemed happy, always seem sad... it hurts me pretty bad. I don't know what to do. I just wanna be a normal teenage adult like I should be."
yes,Cloudy weather will ruin my mood for the entire day to the point where life seems completely meaningless. Sun will make me forget the problems of tomorrow and allow me to focus on today.
yes,I literally never smile or laugh. My smiles are manufactured. I'll curl my mouth up to attempt a smile and then just drop it back again when they've gone.
yes,"I suffer from PTSD which cripples me... I started off pretty well, but an hour later I collapsed mentally and burst into tears and was very down for hours."
yes,"I feel like I want to smash it just so all of these thoughts disappear. ... having dysthymia isn't shitty enough, I constantly ruminating what is wrong with me or why I'm feeling this way or am I feeling okay or am I actually depressed. ... My body aches from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep. ... Fatigue isn't something new but now I have trouble focusing or even starting my tasks at work. ... I feel a lot more tired at work and started to take multiple naps. ... I'm worried if anyone caught me slipping. ... I have no interest in eating even though my stomach growls and I'm hungry. ... Failing at work, failing at managing my depression, failing at taking care of myself, failing at even believing in myself. ... I don't know where I am in this journey. It's like, it's not even low mood at time when it's just 'no mood'. No mood to even play my games, no mood to doomscroll. No mood for anything except for just... Laying in bed staring at nothing whenever I get the chance to."
yes,I was just diagnosed with dysthymia. Plus I’m currently on meds too.
yes,"My Dysthymia numbs me and makes me pretty complacent to how I feel all the time. Depression is a fact of my existence. I'm not very emotional, and it often seems like I feel at a 3 when everyone else is at a 10."
yes,"Starting about 2-3 years ago, essentially I have this feeling of numbness. Like constantly feeling meh, an emotional flatline. Every few weeks I'll fall into a rut where I just feel a nagging and pressuring sadness, loss of energy, and complete mental fog. I have no interest in anything whether hobbies or schoolwork, and I feel detached from my friends and family. Then after a couple of days, I go back to 'normal'. Occasionally, once in a blue moon every few months, I'll peak. Honestly during that time, I feel great. I enjoy things, and I'm insanely productive."
yes,"I had a bad mental breakdown this summer, I was extremely depressed and the only thing that got me out of my bed was my boyfriend. I had never had medication for my dysthymia before... I went from showering once every two weeks to showering twice a week sometimes. I try to cook more and order less... and I am going to the gym… not just once a week BUT EVERY OTHER DAY! "
yes,"I woke up today wishing I didn’t, I sometime just get this feeling of wishing I could just not move and just live In this void that I created in my head. I’m always feeling like I’m suffocating and so much guilt for not pushing through and taking care of my responsibilities."
yes,"I feel I’ll like a blob. A sad nothing of a person... I hate having this parasite in my brain! Im doing all the right things, just let me feel joy!... I hate everything. I just want to be funny and erase my self hatred for a moment... I just want to split my head open and pry out the sickness. I want to be whole."
yes,I was having an empty feeling day and told my bf this: 'I am not happy about my life.' ... it just made my day worse because I didnt mean to be an asshole.
yes,I get overwhelmed and depressed that I have neglected myself or because of the size of the mess that I can’t even action fixing the problem and instead just shutdown.
yes,I'm always afraid that I'm slipping further into not-okay. And it's so hard to know when I am or not. I either panic unnecessarily or I somehow don't notice until I'm already underwater.
yes,"I struggled with a heavier depressive episode and nothing could really help me with feelings of hopelessness and meaninglessness other than cannabis. I am happier, more self confident, more hopeful, generally more optimistic, I stop pondering all the time and most importantly I AM CAPABLE OF FEELING HAPPY."
yes,ruminate and having a hard time concentrating while having dysthymia
yes,"I've just had a run of bad luck, which has just gotten worse over the last month, and it's progressively getting harder for me to see anything at the end of this. I'm just stuck and going nowhere. ...Getting rejection letters saying I didn't meet the minimum requirements, when I met everything. There's also this little voice in the back of my head saying 'You meet the requirements, but they're going to hate you.' ...I'm just so exhausted right now."
yes,"I feel so hopeless and sad. Nothing brings me joy, have nothing to look forward to, at risk of losing my job, no close friends nearby and everyone else just seems to be having a great time in life."
yes,"felt like youre stuck in a blackhole and you don't know how to get out, and you don't know what youre doing wrong"
yes,"I don't feel happy often. I hate loud noises and every time something good happens, I feel that it will not last. I can be irascible at times and I'm not good at all in an argumentative environment or where people can be adversarial. I shrink away and it almost physically hurts me."
yes,"im 19 and js diagnosed w dysthymia, but now w this diagnosis, eveyone is telling me to let loose, im still young i can turn things around, be more positive, go out more often, socialise! but thing is, ive heard all of these and ive tried a few times but now im js tired all the time and so confused."
yes,I don’t want people to know how often I feel I can’t function and how often I have thoughts of suicide.
yes,The only thing that works for me at the moment is sleeping/lying in bed until I am so bored that doing a bit of a tidy up and clean starts to appeal to me.
yes,I tried to OD on benzos and alcohol...I just keep weeping when I'm alone because I should've gone then and there. I feel like I wasn't meant to have been born at all.
yes,"I'm tired of people around me, including my parents, not understanding me, as well as pressuring and guilt-tripping me into trying new jobs and stuff, over and over again for 5 years. I feel so lonely. I've tried to make friends with people that felt genuinely sympathetic but they often break contact, because they find my stuff too heavy..."
yes,"I feel really bad about it, I've just felt so depressed, I don't even care what I eat anymore, but then I tend to feel horrible...I don't even have the motivation to do homework and I just want to sleep all the time"
yes,I've been trying for four years to find a therapist that is helpful. I have found many indifferent ones who merely failed to help and a surprising number of ones who were outright bad.
yes,"I've been exhausted. I haven't been able to cook, cleaning has been immensely difficult. I haven't been able to think as quickly or as clearly as I'm used to. Work tasks are taking me twice as long. I watched myself self-sabotage... My brain feels like it's filled with muted static, and my body feels like sludge. I'm struggling, very hard, right now."
yes,I’ve been on meds for about 10 years and have tried all sorts of combinations and nothing seems to help. I use cannabis but not regularly enough to get off my meds.
yes,I’m just so tired all the time and so sick of hoping for a life that feels less heavy all the time. I just want to not “be” anymore but will never have the guts to end my own life.
yes,I can barely focus on my job and can barely get out of bed. I wake up dreading everything and go to bed dreading everything. I cry at least 2-3 times a day.
yes,"I've been struggling with Dysthymia for around 10 years now, the way I am at the moment and the way I have zero energy to barely function and take care of myself... I don't have the energy to take care of myself most of the time, I feel like if I were left alone I'd die slowly, I wouldn't cook for myself, I wouldn't clean around me, and worst of all I wouldn't ask others for help.. sometimes when I'm out of meds I would just not take them for days until something comes up and I get a chance to buy them..."
yes,"I have had this 'low grade, perpetual depression' since I was a young teen though. My inability to shake it off stems from my disinterest in the methods that are suggested to shake it off. ... My dysthymia and recent uptick in anhedonia are directly related to a keen awareness of the futility of existence. ... I don't want to live past age 50. Lately I keep thinking that I'd like to move up my expiration date."
yes,"In the past few years, I have come to the realisation that I have had a sad life... I feel dull to the bone. And everything around me does, too... I'm just really really tired of everything... It's sad, but I've mostly come to terms with the probability that nobody will ever want me... I love my dad. I am happy sometimes, but there is always that sadness in the back of my mind, that exhaustion. Does it ever go away?"
yes,"I try to meditate, journal, and exercise but lately they’ve barely been helping me at all."
yes,"I skipped 2 classes this week because I couldn’t make myself do the hour-long commute and sit there for a 3 hr lecture. Just getting out of my room everyday to get food is a struggle. ... Sometimes it’s tempting to just stop trying altogether and see what happens. I hate to admit it, but somehow plunging headfirst into the depressive urges feels more appealing than doing what I’ve always done and resisting it but still dying a little more on the inside each day."
yes,"I feel completely NUMB and I've tried many ways of gettin motivated but without success. I REALLY want achieve my goals, in my head I have everything planned and I know I can reach it, but I can't get an organic motivation inside me that makes me go with the flow."
yes,"No one is interested in me, and even if they do, it's hard to find the time and the place to do it. I'm not that attracted to the guys who are interested in me, and the guys I am attracted to don't like me."
yes,I have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and general anxiety. I'm pretty high functioning but struggle with depression and anxiety every single day. Ruminating and low-energy are especially challenging for me.

yes,"I can’t for the life of me find any motivation to do any chores or even leave my bed. The guilt is killing me... But my anxiety keeps getting worse. I’m getting professional help with finding a job and I want to do better, but right now all I can do is worry, feel bad and feel worse."
yes,my bf has been diagnosed with severe dysthymia and has withdrawn. He says he doesn't want to push me away but can't seek what he needs without hurting those who are the most loving and caring towards him.
yes,I just can't deal with the drama and stress atm
yes,"I have this extreme hatred towards my medication and irritations that i keep taking them on and off. I have a theory that maybe i am too used to dysthymia, that my brain and body rejects changes and medications...i have intrusive thoughts to destroy my medications or do something worse to it..."
yes,"I was diagnosed with PDD at the age of 12, been suicidal and depressed since I was 10. I was abused physically, emotionally, economically and mentally by my divorced parents... I suffer from anxiety pretty much constantly, I can barely eat, I avoid pretty much everything and everyone... I’ve always been afraid of self harm, but I tried to commit suicide in February. I just didn’t see the point anymore."
yes,"I get this feeling of shame as if I had been rude or said something weird. I find myself going over the interaction in my head trying to find what went wrong, but there’s nothing."
yes,I've been struggling with dysthymia since I was 11. I felt every bit of emotional blunting...I see how much it affects them and it breaks my heart that most of it is outside my control. I just finished 2+ weeks on Wellbutrin and stopped...I'm so scared. I'm an artist and emotional blunting can actually cost me my career. I feel quite lost and unmotivated. I know it'll get worse before it gets better. And I don't know if meds will ever help...
yes,"I feel so alone and I truly have a hard time connecting with people, even my family who I’ve known all my life. My inability to truly feel connected to people and to feel like I belong has caused a strain on all of my relationships and causes me to distance myself from everyone. My dysthymia makes me feel so ill at times where I don’t want to be around anyone, talk to anyone, or even nourish these connections."
yes,I feel so suicidal right now...I feel so helpless. I feel like everyone in my life hates me.

yes,I think feeling uncomfortable in my body makes it extra bad... I start feeling extra sad and lonely and then feeling like a loser... I feel happier when I disconnect from people and fantasize or something...
yes,"I've had MDD for like 8 years and recently got diagnosed with dysthymia, idk if I'm confused or used to being depressed but I'm having a hard time differentiating the two."
no,"if anyone watched this doc, how did it make you feel about your own personal mental health?"
yes,"I've been chronically depressed for a decade and during this decade, there hasn't been a single day where I wouldn't have chosen euthanasia over life. I find getting out of bed a huge challenge."
yes,I've dealt with dysthymia for over 10 years now and have never found anything that works to treat it at all.
yes,"Sometimes I feel like i’m the only one, it’s classified as dysthymia but i don’t fit neatly into the major depressive or typical dysthymia category because of this."
yes,"I was just using the good old tried and true give up and shut down approach. I'd go to work, get home,  go to the bathroom, go to bed, and stay in bed even if I wasn't tired until the next morning. I did this for like 4 weeks, to essentially skip life to the weekend. I ate nothing until the weekends came aswell. Also my anxiety is so bad today, I'm self conscious about my breathing, where I'm looking, the way I'm talking."
yes,I have been living a very depressed life for more than 3 years now... I feel kind of sad but its not very much. But rather it is like there is no other emotion. I feel kind of dead. I feel like i have no energy and my arms feel numb. I talk slowly and walk slowly. Sometimes it is different and it more of a sad feeling and feeling of loneliness too. Like a want to a hug. No problem with the breathing. No difference in energy.
yes,"I got diagnosed with dysthymia and double depression a month ago and have been on medication. I feel much better now, but it's still so hard for me to concentrate while studying and the brain fog doesn't seem to go away."
yes,I felt happy was for about 30 seconds. I think that was in March. I can't really remember feeling good before that.
yes,"I feel I'm back to square one. It's so disheartening, so scary. I'm back in the dark again and completely terrorised by it."
yes,I was actively managing my dysthymia and my quality of life was much higher... And my good pal Dysthymia is actively kicking my @$$... I feel. So hopeless. It’s going to take quite a bit of time and I’m impatient.

I have had prior problems with addiction to alcohol and a problematic relationship with marijuana, but I am now completely sober. 21 years old, male, type 1 diabetic with well-controlled sugars. I am autistic, which adds a layer of difficulty to assessing my emotional well-being. Hypothyroidism, well regulated, vitamin D deficiency, well regulated."
yes,"I feel that in the past 5 years my mental health has gotten worse. I have a lack of motivation to go after life, I procrastinate and can become paralyzed by basic decision making. I struggle to find the motivation to leave the house unless I have something scheduled...I feel like I lack dreams and goals for life...I just lack confidence and self esteem. I don’t believe that I’ll succeed at things...I fear having a baby because I’m nervous I’ll get post partum depression...I have these crazy swings. One day I’m confident and know I’m amazing, and the next I feel like shit and put myself down like crazy. I have days/moments of feeling totally empty and depressed and can get stuck in rumination...I also suspect I have PMDD...I just know I don’t like myself. I want to be confident and courageous- idk what changed."
yes,feeling strong “emotions” is kinda exhausting
yes,"I could be a trigger to her. It sucks but I know I can't mask my depression. I tried to do it for a long time, but it just made me feel alone and resentful of the people I was masking around. It's a very hard boundary I maintain, and although it's so isolating, I'd rather be alone than feel that way again."
yes,"I keep cycling randomly through the same half dozen pages and searches or I’m afraid that by putting it down I’ll be admitting defeat and that yes, nothing matters anymore and, I don’t want to do that just yet so I cycle directionlessly through social media -but making very rare if any posts- and google searches as a way to distract myself."
yes,The thought of possibly passing on dysthymia to my potential children feels... irresponsible.
yes,It feels as if I'm suffocating.. all the time. Not hard enough to die though. Just enough to make me weak. To get my mind spinning. Chaos all over me. ...I am standing still in front of this never ending sea. And I am suffocating. ...I can feel this pressure drowning me. And I have fought this battle so many times.. I am done.
yes,"I'm only alive bc my attempts failed, I'm only alive bc i haven't died. ... I used to not feel anything, but came to those realizations and felt ecstatic. Like wow I'm actually looking forward to this that's amazing."
yes,"The feeling I have experienced is best described as mild depersonalization. It begins as a general warm fuzziness, a feeling that I am slightly disconnected from my mind. If you’ve ever taken an opiate, there are definite similarities there. They inserted a needle into my arm to check my blood sugar (I’m a type one diabetic,) and I felt it but not as much as I ordinarily would."
yes,"wake up with a slight weight pressing down in the center of your chest...not wanting to speak to anyone, even through text"
no,"I tried CBD, and it did nothing for me. I might not have taken it long enough, but it just wasn't for me.
The efficacy of these chemicals may be contingent on the symptoms you're trying to target.
The research to support Cannabis' effectiveness overall for mental health treatment is still pretty limited. From the anecdotal evidence, however, most people associate CBD with stress and anxiety regulation. So, if a symptom you're trying to target is insomnia, it may help with that. Or it may help with any concurrent anxiety you have.
THC is known more for its psychotropic effects and may be more useful for mood regulation.
However, there's evidence to suggest that long-term THC usage can result in worsened depression and the emotional numbing that can come with it. It may also dysregulate your sleep. Of course there are also the reported effects of increased anxiety, paranoia, and a decreased capacity for emotional regulation similar to alcohol.
Both of these also come with the downsides of an increased tolerance over time (meaning you'll need more to get the same effects), as well as an increased cost as a result. These risks also come with antidepressants, of course.
There isn't a ton of up front risk for you to try cannabis and see if it works for you (unless you have an allergy). However, dosage is important, especially with extracts/oils. So start small and work your way up if it is something you want to try. See if there's a cannabis clinic in your area that could advise you on first steps.
I'd also recommend to get a full panel of blood work before moving forward with anything, if you're looking for alternatives. If you have low iron/B12/vitamin D, that could be contributing to depressive symptoms. Other mineral deficiencies or health issues could be causing stuff like fatigue, etc.
I am not a health professional, so take the above with caution as you do your own research and consultations.
Good luck on your journey - I hope you find something that helps."
yes,I would smoke with friends I’d just feel like “I am so bored is this seriously what we are doing all night?” It did not give me any sort of mood boost. But my coping mechanism that I know is NOT good has been alcohol.
yes,"I tend to get bored and then I can hear the unwanted thoughts louder, and I feel so lazy that I can’t even manage to do anything to try to clear them, like move around or practice music/art."
yes,None of them seemed to help my depression or anxiety. THC...sets off my anxiety nowadays and I have panic attacks.
yes,CBD temporarily helps my anxiety a bit but it hasn’t done anything for my depression.
yes,I struggle with the most is motivation to actually do stuff other than sit down and game all day every day
no,I use a ton of different thc's and cbc for mine. It costed me a couple hundred in different dispensary carts till i matched. Would most likely be the same for you. Cbd wont do much try cbc which is for your mental. If you're in america and in a thc legalised state try elyxr.com. Cheap potent quality shit. Been using them for 2+ yrs and keeps me from yk. Delta 10 is best for euphoria and helping thoughts imo. If it's legal in your state you can try amanita muscaria/muscimol. If not I've never had my packages checked so it could sneak through. Can use code TIKTOK to get 30%.
yes,"my brain just keeps whirring while my body becomes too lethargic to want to move. ""Jfc I’m so bored, why do people like getting high?"" I’ve also found alcohol to be unhelpful, mostly bc I’m a cry-drunk and I just get sadder."
yes,"managing difficult thoughts or emotions in the moment, but it can pretty quickly muffle any motivation to do things"
yes,withdrawals once you become heavily mentally addicted make you severely hopeless
yes,the crying and somehow everything feels worse. These episodes seem to be tied to me being upset about something very specific.
yes,"I find myself unmotivated and unsatisfied. ...I just feel outmatched by my own brain. ...I don't want to be the person I am right now, I miss the relationships and personalities I formed in highschool and as a 31 y.o that just doesn't feel healthy. ...Feels lonely man."
yes,"I’m 24, and JUST finally receiving a proper diagnosis of dysthymia and adhd."
yes,"Feels like I’m the closest I’ve ever been to really giving up. I see nothing to live for, all I can think about is how the future is going to be full of the same pointless, awful feelings. I don’t feel interested or passionate about my classes like I used to and I don’t feel any interest in working in the field that I’ve spent the last 6 years in school for. I feel so overwhelmed by everything. Overwhelmed by having to live."
yes,So basically I'm on medication...and it feels like all the bad things just start to resurface again. ...I stay home for a week don't go outside don't talk to anyone...I ignore important people/urgent messages or even just friends...I feel like a complete asshole and a shitty person and I think they hate me.
yes,"I feel like I literally can’t... I feel so stuck and if this is what life is and what it’s gong to be, I don’t know if I can cope forever."
yes,"you don’t go, because when everything is fine, you don’t need to go, and when it’s bad, you don’t want to go? And every time you dissuade yourself: this is neurotic, it has not yet been proven that I have mental problems"
yes,Please give me hope.
yes,"I’d feel like I’m high, like everything would feel like 10x times better even things that feel bad and it’s all physically."
no,Title
yes,"my mind is an unstable, unreliable, and shaky place; and the external existence is impermanent, fleeting, empty, and suffering. I get hit by waves of depression and it might be that I have to deal with chronic feelings of depression for the rest of my life."
no,Has anyone tried it? Just wondering ppls thoughts and experiences.
yes,"I feel a tingling sensation over both my arms, legs, neck, over the eyes and all over the scalp. The tingling sensation feels like a electric current running over the scalp and forehead and leg while doing any activity like speaking, reading, writing, sitting when somebody comes before me and in other social situations. At other times the tingling sensation becomes a heavy fog highly irritating over the scalp. The whole sensation is highly irritating and unpleasurable and unavoidable how much you try."
yes,its hard to come to terms with the fact i might be stuck with this for the rest of my life.
no,Why is this subreddit so small compared to r/depression / r/bipolar? I find it hard to believe that dysthymia is such a rare disorder.
yes,I work hard to put forward an image of a generally cheery guy because I know that people don’t want to be around misery - but I believe that people can subconsciously sense hidden misery in others. This has affected every facet of my life but particularly dating - I hook up a lot but I have never been able to move past that stage into developing a relationship.
yes,"I'm tired of coming home to an apartment with dirty laundry laying everywhere... I'm tired of trash piling up on the floor... I'm tired of getting done with work and coming home and zoning out to Netflix or Reddit... I'm tired of worrying about turning 30 this month and not knowing where I'm going... I'm not drowning, I'm just drifting aimlessly..."
yes,experience their emotions as if through a fogged glass barrier- as if you can sort of tell they're there but you don't consciously feel them except for times of very heightened negative emotion...it's hard to hold on to positive moments with others because they're so fleeting and quickly buried by the stronger negative emotions.
yes,I likely have been depressed since I was a teenager but only got diagnosed at 28. ... I don’t know who I am without the depression.
yes,"At my worst, when it was not 'mild,' and I couldn't bother getting out of bed for a few months, couldn't bother with anything... self-loathing for not living up to what I was *supposed* to be, for always berating myself for not being good enough... I couldn't acknowledge my accomplishments (because I just focus on what I have *not* done, I lose sight of what I can do and have done) and trouble accepting compliments."
yes,"I’ve always been mildly unhappy, even when I was a kid who grew up in a perfectly happy family. And of course there are depression episodes comes on goes once in a while. But I always thought everyone is like this and it’s normal to constantly feel like shit"
yes,I started dissociating. Id suddenly notice something that someone apparently left near me even though I had no memory of the person leaving It. I remember looking at my watch and an hour had gone by in a blink.
yes,"I had a stack of boxes that grew into 3 stacks that I always meant to take out to the dumpster but never did. Yes, there were a lot of bugs that were living off the old food in them."
yes,"it always takes more energy than it gives, and I end up burning myself out"
yes,"it almot feels as a cycle on which the happiness gets stronger and more intense each time it happens, just as how strong and intense the crash feels like (including the self destructive and reckless behavior that comes with it)"
yes,"I was more depressed than I’ve been in years. All I could do was sleep or cry. I had no will to wake up each morning and the feeling was getting worse and worse. I felt truly doomed for my future and eventually decided it was time to try meds again, because I couldn’t keep living like that."
yes,"I haven't really been feeling any joy or anticipation when doing these things. Also not when doing the things I loved before, like traveling or painting. In fact, I don't really care whether or not I see my friends or family or whether I go on a trip. Rarely does something spark joy in me. I often feel apathetic and do these things just because I used to do them and because they are part of life. Sometimes I even feel like I'm not really taking part in these activities."
yes,"i’m lying on the bathroom floor. i’ve been crying for hours. it feels scary. i don’t know what i’m going to do. i feel so different, like i’m in a new world now. i feel numb, yet emotional."
yes,"I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I could have a mental disorder. I can acknowledge that my 'personality' has created alot of distress in my life. I don't have any trauma, I can pinpoint the exact year where I changed from being normal and happy to just always having an underlying 'sadness' in my life. I am very pessimistic, only dealt with suicidal ideation once ( the same year my overall mood changed significantly), have low self-esteem and occasionally SH"
yes,"Totally fucked up my finances and don’t have rent, don’t have the motivation to do anything to make up the money, just wanna sleep until my problems fix themselves and I can stop feeling ashamed."
no,https://preview.redd.it/51n8h8x8e4a61.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=990fccc6e1754f541a672b020747e1f1006761a0
yes,"I began wondering if I am the problem, here. Perhaps I should not attempt to steer humanity from asking others how they are. But every word I wrote is true to me, and an honest response. ...it almost always causes troubles, and makes the person feel less comfortable when talking to me. But if I don't, the relationship feels like a dysphoric lie."
yes,"I have little motivation to do things, have become isolated, small things seem huge and big things seem giant, issues concentrating in conversations and on boring tasks, neglecting most of my hobbies, not a happy person due to difficult life circumstances and my failure to succeed socially, feel indifferent, sad, or angry, suffer from low self-esteem and have called myself a loser and a failure"
yes,I haven't genuinely laughed for 2-3 years. I fake my every laugh and smile. The most I can laugh genuinely is just a little faster exhaling from my nose.
yes,I very obviously struggle with depression/anxiety... I'll stick to the treatment plan and continue the therapy I was already regularly having
yes,"It's 4:52 AM ... pretend. But it's becoming way too hard. ... I'm so tired, so much in pain, I just can't. ... I come from a Muslim background, a strong one. It's been 10-15 years that I had the passive thought of dying. ... My brain is sick. Science, at the point where it's at cannot cure it. For some people it can but for me it doesnt work. Sure the meds help 60% of the time. They trim some of the lowest lows, make them a bit more bearable. They allow you to go to work and pretend a little bit more. Therapy just made me realize that there is no cure. Sure, you can cope, use tricks to fight it. But again what's the point? ... The only reason is not to hurt them, kinda. The idea of suicide is so so foreign to them that it would destroy them if I did it. But again, rationally, do I really have it in me to maintain this mascarade called life for the next 50 years?"
yes,"alot of stressfull things come my way, even tho it takes ALOT of my energy, the past is getting back to me, So everything is overwelming, and i have the feeling i can break down any minute.no motivation barely sleeping"
yes,"The 40 year dysthymia sufferer who wants to commit suicide, ...my life if I lived. Problem is, if I can't die, I certainly don't know how to live."
yes,My psych told me these two meds are more targeted for longer lasting types of depression like Dysthymia.
yes,"I feel like everyone hates me at my job and I end up spiralling and needing to take a leave from the job... The smallest things throw me off my rhythm... Four months ago I went to the ER because of the deep feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness i was feeling and how I wanted to die... I cried for two days straight... I don't want to keep going, especially if no one believes me."
yes,"I suffered with very severe insomnia and being dependant on prescription medication to help me fall asleep. Sometimes, especially right now though, I find myself falling into episodes of hypersomnia as my insomnia fades away. Instead of depending on meds, I can fall asleep on my own, but I’m always fatigued and exhausted, sore and achy, and it doesn’t matter how much I sleep, it’s never enough."
yes,i've never taken any sort of meds before because my mom had a bad experience with them so they've terrified me to take any :/ i took a gene test to see which medications would be best and a lot of them are in the “green” category meaning they’ll hypothetically go good with my body but i’m still scared
yes,I’ve been depressed for over 20 years and have tried nearly everything. I don’t see anything happening.
no,"I have read on here about people suggesting genetic testing to see which medications they can tolerate. Has anyone does this? If yes, what does it entail? Does insurance cover it? Did it help you identify the best meds for you?"
yes,"I feel like I need to rest all the time, I never get enough of it"
yes,"I often lose my loved ones, and kill or hurt myself; I disappointed them, I messed up a million times until they hated me; I hate myself so much; I feel the need to sleep all the time, but when I sleep I just get these awful fucking nightmares that make me want to die; I feel so fucking sick. I have a constant headache; I really, really want to start over. All I feel is regret and confusion and self hate; feel too depressed to move now. want to sleep to escape, but am too scared of what my mind has waiting for me."
yes,I am basically just emotionally numb and have been since I was a teenager.
yes,I believe having dysthymia makes it extra hard to kick the habit of porn because we are often depressed and sad and seek that quick dopamine rush but that's a double edged sword because once your high leaves your body you get the worst downer and feel a lot worse than before
yes,I’ve felt like I’ve been living in a real gray area between blank emotions. Today I read the symptoms of anhedonia again and realized I now connect to them more than ever.
yes,"The thought of having someone demanding attention and expecting lots of social interaction everyday feels draining to be honest. I mean the regular daily work routine, and the constant fatigue along with dysthymia, is too much by itself."
yes,"I'm the youngest of a family that's been pretty beaten up... When I was diagnosed after 10 years of being pretty numb and existential and slipping in and out of depression constantly, it made so much sense to me. Of course this was it. Everything fit. It made me relieved, honestly, that this was the problem with me. This is why I so often just give up on everything because what is the point? Or feel so dreadfully empty for months on end, but I do go to work (numbly) and I do hang with friends (numbly) and I cope in bad ways, but there was always a moment I felt a little lighter and that gave me hope, which led to a month or two of feeling joy- but I always slipped back. "
yes,I'm tired of jobs or hobbies not being interesting or worth it to me.
yes,"told the psychiatrist that the meds I take are not working, she increased the dose anyway... despite the fact that she wanted to start lithium and then changed her mind, citing my physical health as a reason for not doing it despite the fact that she knew about my physical health problems even before I'd seen her."
yes,I constantly think of earlier stages in my life and think of what I could have/should have done to make life more enjoyable. I even have memories of being about 10 years old and daydreaming about being pre-school or kindergarten age and wishing I didn't mess up that era of my life.
yes,I never experienced love. I never experienced 'self love'. I don't even understand how someone is supposed to feel. My mind is more or less feels blank. I do not have inner monologue before I'm writing or talking. I spend my time lying in bed because everything is boring to me. My memory only goes back to age 9. I have no recollection at all from an earlier age.
yes,I have been diagnosed for some years with PDD. ...this chronic depression weighs on our relationship in ways that I think is unfair to him.
yes,"Chronic depression is a state of chronic 'stress activation':  the body’s stress-response systems are revving nonstop.  Hormones (like cortisol) stream through the body, preparing you for dangers which may never materialize.  The effects of this long-term “activation of the stress response systems” are devastating for the brain and the body.  The body responds by increasing adrenaline, by elevations in blood pressure, by increased blood levels of sugars and fats."
no,"Yes, all it did was relax me, and it is like meditation sort of. It really helps me fall asleep and stay asleep better."
yes,I often have trouble feeling tired enough to fall asleep or sometimes I won't sleep solid throughout the night. A lot of times whether I sleep decent or not I hate getting up. Its affecting my cognition and ability to be social. I'm fatigued all day usually and no amount of caffeine helps.
yes,"i woke up on only four hours of sleep... i stayed until about 11a... i didn’t feel the need to escape to my phone or go home early even once... i was away from home and socializing for 17 1/2 hours yesterday, and i felt totally fine when i got home. incredible."
yes,"I have ADHD, social anxiety and dysthymia. I've been working hard and started intermittently feeling things 2 years ago. During that time, I would feel the low mood returning but my feelings were muted and hollow but it didn't impact my day to day, 'just' my quality of life. For no reason, I started an epic backwards slide about a week ago except this time I can feel all of the overwhelming sadness, inadequacy and loneliness. I keep crying and it's freaking out both my husband and myself."
yes,"I get neck aches, headaches, other random body aches, sometimes I get a feeling kind of like I’m coming down with a flu. Tonight I have a cold shaky kind of feeling."
yes,"struggling with severe anhedonia, sleep all day, barely eat, don’t shower or wash my teeth even"
yes,"anhedonia, low self-esteem, masking, paralysing anxiety, emotional exhaustion, sleep disorders, eating disorders and addiction"
no,"Researchers at Johns Hopkins are conducting a brief online survey about the effects of psilocybin in people who have used a moderate to high dose of psilocybin mushrooms (also called “magic mushrooms”) while taking an antidepressant medication, or within two years of stopping such treatment. Psilocybin is a compound that occurs naturally in certain species of mushrooms, and is currently being studied for its possible antidepressant effects. However, people who are currently using or have recently used antidepressants may react differently to psilocybin, and this interaction is not well understood. Your participation in this research study can help improve our understanding of how psilocybin works in people who have used antidepressant medications.

yes,"I don't recall even a fleeting moment when I've felt 'I am so glad to be alive'. Even as a child I remember being lonely, shy, low energy... I've been stuck in this mire not doing anything to get out. I've tried many cures - hypnotherapy, homeopathy, meditation, eft, etc. Since the last 13 years or so not a day goes by that I don't wish that I was just dead."
yes,was diagnosed with dysthymia a few months ago. psych reckons caused by my messed up childhood and says it's going to take years to fix. was put on meds.
yes,The insomnia is terrible. Can't sleep through the night. Too tired to get anything done. Stressing big time
yes,I have recently diagnosed with dysthymia and I work as people manager. The trigger for start looking my situation was a major burnout I had at work.
yes,"I had a depressive episode of 2 years then 2 months better and then another almost 2 years of depressive episode, now it’s been a month and a half that I’m ok. I don’t have daily negative thoughts, but I don’t wanna live in the future but I would be fine with it if I died rn"
yes,I look angry/sad all the time even when I feel normal
yes,"Curl up into a ball and sob, maniacal laughter, emotional numbness"
yes,"I'm coming out of a low episode at the moment...I probably have about 2, maximum 3 lows a year that I consider serious, in that over 3-4 days, I basically can't function."
yes,"I was gone, I don’t think I was “down”/“depressed” at all. I’ve been home for less than 48 hours and I’m back to suicidal ideation. I’m just so tired of the day-to-day. I really need a job change and have had no luck. Maybe this time it’s a bit of situational depression on top of my dysthymia, I don’t know."
yes,"I’m not that stable mentally, i see people who have it way worse than me, i get more depressed and unstable. I don’t see a way I could break of this cycle. I want to believe that we’ll all be better in the future, we’ll get help and be there for one another till we balance ourselves out but it feels like nothing but mere false hope to cope with the awful feeling.. can we really all achieve mental stability? I want to live but living is such a struggle"
yes,I had been going through mood swings... My happy thoughts/good moods are often fleeting and the dopamine rush is gone as fast as it came.
yes,"I feel like i get easily distracted in conversation and have a hard time managing tasks alone. I don't know if its my persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), my social anxiety, or something else... I got diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder)"
yes,"I feel something happened and I just mentally shut down, because this is the most apathetic I’ve felt in my life - and that’s saying a LOT. I always feel like I’m putting on an act during social interactions and it is exhausting. I don’t feel fulfilled or enriched by anything in life. I’m pretty much always depressed. I don’t know how to go on."
yes,"For about a year, all I've been able to do when I'm not at work is be in bed, and it's led to situations where my house has gotten out of control and I am so desperately out of shape. I'm about 215lbs as a 5'5"" woman and today, my heart rate was noticeably elevated from just walking up the stairs."
yes,"I was diagnosed with dysthymia, I was given little to no insight on the types of things it affects and how it can affect my life. I’m just looking to see if what I’m feeling and how my life is, is more normal than I think."
yes,I'm tired of being so tired. I think it's the no.1 thing that is contributing to this never ending cycle of depression.
yes,I complain a lot more than the average person and I am not good at hiding any negative emotions that I may be feeling. I accept that my mood inevitably settles into one which is more negative than positive.
yes,woke up this morning w the feeling that i killed someone without any reason. this happens pretty often for me.
yes,"I felt motivated, having lots of Ideas and started to fantasize about resuming projects that have been in the drawer for years. The load in the chest that I am normally carrying was somehow not present anymore, intrusive thoughts were passing away easily. But, as you can already imagine, that lasted just couple of days. When I woke up the day afterwards everything came in place, the numbness, the demotivation, lack of concentration, feeling of wasting time, low self-esteem etc..."
yes,"I've been going through too much for years. I was bullied, sexually abused, had a car crash that left me with PTSD, and was cheated on by my wife. I feel so lonely, I don't feel anything, I'm being mobbed at my job, I don't eat, and I have anxiety."
yes,"about to start on meds for the first time ever in about a week or two and just wanted to hear other dysthymics' experiences with the initial start, since it's apparently supposed to be awful."
yes,my family hates me my dad hates me and nobody understands the real life hell the last 2 years have been
yes,I felt high but it was boring and depressing I’m also on Prozac
yes,"I'm just very numb. I do things automatically like working, eating, sleeping, taking my son to school, feeding the dog, but I don't feel motivated. I feel like an imposter at work, and even simple tasks like house cleaning feel like an impossible challenge. I just don't know what to do because I don't want to do anything."
yes,"I feel alienated and alone. I don’t feel understood or seen by anyone in my life or that anyone could possibly relate. I don’t feel like there’s anyone who I could possibly open up to or who would care, even my wife. ... I’m exhausted: between working full time so we can barely make our bills, the constant demands of work and home and homeostasis, and the unending agony of it all. ... I just need time to stop for about a month and a half so can just breath and catch back up. ... It’s just as well. I can’t talk about it. I try, but the words fall apart in my throat and come out garbled and I just get frustrated."
yes,"I feel alone and misunderstood, I’m a failure and I can’t even cry even though I want to so badly. I keep getting to the verge of tears but I just can’t."
yes,"I want to cry from exhaustion all the time. Sometimes I'm doing chores and tears start slipping from my eyes because I'm so tired. I pretty much take care of everything myself now... I'm so tired. So exhausted. I just cry sometimes, because I'm so exhausted... Everything is a struggle. Taking care of myself is a chore, and a hard one, just another thing I'm expected to do, don't have the energy for yet clench my teeth and do anyway (crying the entire time, sometimes). Nobody is there to, I don't know, help me with all that stuff... Life is so awfully despairful that I may not want to die, but I have no idea how I could end up actually happy someday."
yes,"I've had a diagnosis of dysthymia for around 8 months, but have been what I call depressed for around 13 years now. I continue to work, socialise, laugh and smile, all whilst being completely consumed and overwhelmed by thoughts of killing myself, and of wishing to be dead."
yes,"I felt numb, suicidal (what I describe as 'passive' suicidal but more frequent than it had been lately) , and sad. The numb sadness is the scariest part of this when it happens and I hate it when it comes back."
yes,"I wish it was him just asking me questions then telling me what to do to get better, and less of me just getting stuff off my chest, which is nice to have someone to tell things I wouldn’t tell my friends, like about suicidal thoughts"
yes,"I know the things that I should do and it's not all that hard to do them. ... What is the purpose of waking up and fulfilling your obligations if you'll never feel the satisfaction that others do? ... If I don't have that, and my experience of life is objectively negative, what's the point in continuing to live?"
yes,3 month’s worth of garbage accumulating around my apartment
yes,"I have dysthymia diagnosed by a professional. I have been ill probably since my early teenage years (38 years right now), without even knowing I was ill. I never understood what a sense of happiness was. My wife left me having enough of me. I returned to my small room at my parents' house. Back then I went to the doctor many times, and was usually prescribed medications for depression. I began to have suicidal thoughts, nothing was working after all, my life was one big misery."
yes,ive had pdd probably since ive started high school and ive always skipped school a lot. getting up in the morning and falling asleep at night is hard for me... i feel like theres no escape. i know id never kill myself but the thoughts are becoming unbearable. i dont know how to deal with this. i feel like im at my lowest. my life is just an endless road that im too tired to walk down. i just dont know what to do anymore. i feel so empty inside i cant take it anymore.
yes,"I feel like I’ve become more possibly depressed. I just sort of dread each day because it all feels the same and sort of pointless. Little tasks like answering a work call or meeting with my boss feel like pulling teeth. I don’t have the energy to talk to people and sometimes I feel so irritable and angry when asked to do certain things cuz I just want to be left alone and the things I need to do for my job just feel so fucking stupid and unimportant. I don’t see my friends or family much and I know that’s a problem but I just have no motivation, for my job or my relationships."
yes,"I really have to force myself to do anything sportive, my entire life the same... I wonder whether it's a 'symptom' of dysthymia."
yes,I just know I will never be that parent that will have as much energy/enthusiasm/positivity etc. that a child deserves. It kills me.
no,what is major depressive factors and what is the last part?
yes,I've been mentally ill since I was 11... I was diagnosed as having treatment resistant persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)... I decided at that point that I don't want to reach my 40th birthday.
yes,"I feel… weak. ... Every. Single. Day. I can hear the voices in my head telling me what a tremendous piece of shit I am, how I don’t measure up as a man, how incredibly pathetic and weak I am. ... I’ve alienated everyone in my life because my little brainwave friends have convinced me none of them actually wanted me around, or even really liked me. ... I don’t want to be this way. I don’t like it and I don’t want to do it anymore."
yes,"I know for a fact my Magnesium is low, doctors have pointed it out to me after blood tests...So this morning I started on Magnesium supplements and will report back here if this helps my Dysthymia at all."
yes,"I feel so empty. ... I don't even look forward to college now. ... It's so tiring. School is empty, work is empty, free-time is empty, everything is empty. No sadness, anger, or joy - only irritation or apathy."
yes,"i was diagnosed with dysthymia...i just felt like it wasnt real - that the diagnosis wasnt real...its been 7 years and ive only just realised how real this is. i have no long term friends, its so hard to get close to people. everything i do in life just feels like a distraction until i eventually die."
yes,I’m always wiped out when I wake up and never feel rested...I can’t help but be frustrated by it.
yes,I just keep failing to do the other work and handle the other things like signing up for classes. I suck at that a lot. I don’t feel any better or not depressed anymore. I think my brain is just fucked and no amount of talking to some self important therapist can fix that (fuck therapy).
yes,"I didn't even think I had depression. I thought I was lazy and just had insomnia. When your every-day is a constant low, you forget what normal is actually supposed to be. You lose that frame of reference. And you still can't quite shake the feeling that maybe you *are* just lazy and tired."
yes,"Nothing is really fun, like at all, not even for a second. Hell, i feel nothing, sad/angry/frustrated if anything, but only when shit hits the fan. I feel like im floating in nothingness..."
yes,"I probably had dysthymia, I would not pay attention in training and forget what i was taught. I never had thoughts of causing harm to myself and I would say normally my dysthymia is under control but on days i get double depression I get anxious and feel this buzz feeling from my chest to throat"
yes,The people without dysthymia tended to overestimate their score while those with dysthymia tended towards being accurate.
yes,I was dissociating at one point and wasn't in the moment at all. I pushed through and let the moment pass.
yes,"I've been in what feels like a major depression episode for about 5+ years now. I feel like a total loser. I've lost interest in all my hobbies, only go outside if I have to leave the house for work, my ex isolated me from everyone so I don't even know how to properly socialize anymore. I'm tired of being so miserable and having no one"
yes,"I feel ridiculous because only now am I actually facing what my issues have been vs just numbing myself. I'm overwhelmed by guilt of a history of failed relationships. I cant help but feel that my dysthymia has been a major player in the failures. I want to open up to my partner more and share what dysthymia feels like but I am terrified to be honest. If I say I literally have no drive, have no want, have no passion, don't get pleasure out of most things - how is that attractive in any way?"
yes,"I am dealing with the fact that, due to feeling depressed, I cannot really remember around a year of my life"
yes,"Depression is back in full power, and overall feeling very unwell, physically and mentally. I wake up every day already tired, I don't want to face the world outside. Every day is the same shit. Anxiety, fatigue and derealization make socializing extremely difficult. I'm terrified of loneliness and the fact that taking care of myself would become too much. I'm playing scenarios in my head, of when I used to have dinner alone while crying, or too tired to buy groceries, to face problems with the house and neighbours."
yes,"I have low self esteem, sometimes very bad where I hate myself other times where I just passively don’t like myself. I have this sadness just below the surface, sometimes when I think to hard it comes out. One time recently I just randomly out of nowhere felt tired and sad. On the bus ride home I was crying. I can barely keep up with work due to my ADHD, and so often I just feel so overwhelmed and tired. I have bad days and good days. Sometimes I am genuinely happy, sometimes I have overall good days. But if I were to say my mood overall in terms of my life I am not happy. I can be happy, but I am not happy with my life."
yes,I just lost my shit and started squeezing the food between my fingers and throwing it everywhere. Then I managed to pull myself together and clean everything up. Now I’m just sitting here feeling like things are terribly wrong and wishing I knew how to fix my messed up head.
yes,"I want to scream from the top of my lungs. I want to break down and have a good long hard cry. I want to bang my head against a wall. I want my armpits to stop sweating, my hands to stop shaking, my mind to stop racing, and my chest to stop aching. I want to cry."
yes,"Felt an ""episode"" of sorts coming on last week or so and talked to my doc.  Based on my history and current status, I'm now ""Major Depressive Disorder"" with a side of Dysthimia."
yes,Been feeling shitty lately and I cut myself for the first time in years. I hate that I liked it.
yes,"I got diagnosed with PTSD, General Anxiety and Dysthymia last week. This means that I'm basically under Constant Stress and Constant depression. I've never fucking found out how it feels to not be depressed, stressed or suicidal. It's terrible."
yes,They treat me like I'm some sort of monster because my depression gets the better of me every once in awhile. I've gotten better at identifying when it's coming on and have been communicating with my wife about it when it hits.
no,Bottom text
yes,"I’m currently experiencing a major depressive episode, and have been for the past couple of months. I think I am reaching a point where I’m not sure how much I can handle the pain anymore. Everyday is just so painful for me. Each day that I wake up, I feel like it’s a glaring reminder of how much of a failure I am. I am so tired of hurting. I am tired of being sad every day. I am tired of being in conflict with myself everyday about taking my own life. I feel like life would be so much better for the people around me if it was successful. Everyday, my brain would remind me that I’m worthless, a failure, a mistake. I got my university degree, but I’m struggling to find a job, and the pressure of student loans is becoming so unbearable. It’s getting harder and harder to become productive, as well. Most of the day, I can’t really move because of my depression. I don’t know what to do with my life. I am a mess. I feel like everything I do is wrong. I’m not sure how much longer I can tolerate myself."
yes,"I fucking hate that. I hate the fact that i barely have any irl friends, i hate the human suffering, i hate that at the end of the day all of this will be gone and that despite my all worries, i will die knowing i could've spend my time better than being worried about random people's opinions.This stupid cycle. I hate it."
yes,"I’ve been diagnosed with MDD+PDD. I used paroxetine and trazodon for a while. They didin’t work so we switched to venlafaxine + mirtazapine. During the switch, I felt euthymia for the first time. I never felt this content and in a blissful state before. It was only for a day. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t hypomania. Then I went to being in a textbook dysthymic mood."
yes,"i start to get irrationally angry when ppl i know don’t hide their feelings from me. i wish i could be more supportive, but when i’m working so hard to seem fine and stay strong and other people just have breakdowns openly, i get annoyed."
yes,it really does help with my mental health
yes,Had a schedule after my recent diagnosis. Had a major slip. Trying to start again
yes,"when i do it i feel less energy, dont focus on goals or dont care, less confidence, i can say its night and day i feel much better mentally, have more energy, focus on goals, more confidence"
yes,"Having dysthymia since 14. My dysthymia got worse at 20 because of a sad event. I face many symptoms, one of them is unexplained weight gain."
yes,I told her that seeing a psychiatrist is a revolving door system which I come out of feeling worse than when I went in because they bullshit me and then discharge me and I absolutely refuse to see another psychiatrist. I'll cut a bitch If I have to I swear. I'll climb the biggest building in town and fall off that fucker I don't care
yes,"I’ve been going through terrible cycles of feeling down/having ridiculously low self esteem since I was about 17... I don’t cry even one time, but it takes me weeks/months to stop feeling like everything is worthless... I’ve always wanted to be a writer, but have often felt like I’m not good enough, etc... I spent a long time thinking I was just a stupid, lazy piece of shit."
yes,"Ive always felt like adding more green leafy vegetables might help a little...My mood really ebbs and flows, so I’m never really sure when something has worked or it’s just coincidence."
no,"Im no doctor, but from personla exp Iron deficiency, Vit D, and general vitamin deficiency can make you feel on the down side of the rollercoaster. I think a general multivit wouldn’t hurt to your health."
yes,I had very low levels of Vitamin D and B. Started taking supplements and it made a difference to my mood and energy levels.
no,"Taking care of myself really helped me , i bought new clothes and such but i think changing your diet can help a lot too. Certain foods can improve your mood and others can make you feel more down. I wish you luck!!"
yes,"I fall into apathy a little less...I will have an extra crummy emotional state Monday and/or Tuesday, including lots of tears...Reducing my sugar intake has been helpful...I need to consume meat for a variety of reasons, including dysthymic reasons."
no,"I've done keto for 6 months, lost 30 kg, and felt much better. It was hard to keep since I have a low-functioning gall bladder. Still, the weight is still off and at least I felt I could do something to improve my mood."
no,"I think optimizing our diets is something we should all do, regardless of our mood; it's not always going to fix how we feel, but being physically healthier will improve our odds of being mentally healthier. We all have different needs, and I suggest staying away from anyone who says any particular diet is the best one. There are however a few things good to start with and then you can tinker from there: 1) Cut out processed sugar 2) No trans fats 3) Limit alcohol 4) Increase the amount of omega 3 & 9 fats you eat (fish, avocado, olive oil, flax)"
yes,"I live in an area with a really long winter, and Vitamin D supplementation has helped me a lot."
no,Has anyone started exercising regularly and actually felt better and had more energy?
yes,"Week 2 of double depression, I've been slowly trying all my coping mechanisms I can do for myself but nothing is making a dent; they feel like just wasting time rather than helping me through. I can't get help from others either due to attachment disorders."
yes,"I was diagnosed with Dysthymia when I was 7. Meds don't work, therapy doesn't work, exercise works sometimes."
yes,"I've never felt good enough. I never wanted to do anything, I just did what people made me do, because it was less energy then fighting it. I live constantly wanting to do things but never having energy. I always thought that people baseline mood was down, turns out it's not true. I'm not a freak for being this way, but I hate not having the motivation to live beyond just existing. Sometimes I get frustrated for no reason, and I feel like I'll never be good enough... Sometimes I can't leave bed."
yes,All the brain fog and numbness and leaving it up to chance with how much energy I have for a day has really taken a toll on me. I can't enjoy anything anymore and it's taking me a lot to not call it quits these days.
yes,I cant concentrate for weeks. Ive been really down recently. I even had a slight meltdown and cried an hour to my sister the other day.
yes,"I struggled with depression since childhood. I had some times where I had my life together and was resilient, but I always felt depressed. Recently, I went through a very severe clinical depression and had to take a medical leave from work. After a few medical appointment and describing my symptoms, long term and short term, I was diagnosed with dysthymia and double depression."
yes,"I feel forced about going to my psychiatrist and psychologist only makes me feel worse, because I don't wanna see them anymore... concerned about my suicidal thoughts and past"
yes,"I dont feel like meeting my friends, and don't feel like going out and nothing gives me joyness. I am already on meds and on therapy, but I dont feel they are working."
yes,"You are not lazy because you are depressed, but depressed because you are lazy"
yes,I hate how everyone is towards me...this world is shitty anyways. Me i can't be loved unless money is involved..
no,"So i finally found a friend who had some leftover dried mushrooms from last season. Still weeks away from mushroom season here (Australia), I've had a hard time finding some. But I've started taking 0.5-0.8 of a gram each day for 3 days then a two day break (2nd break day today). This is on top of the Magnesium supplements I started almost 2 weeks ago now. Nothing to note just yet, although I have noticed a slightly elevated mood in the last 2 days, but we'll see if it continues. I'll be microdosing for approx. 4-6 weeks based on how much I have left so I should have some hard data by the end of it. Will report my findings."
yes,"I just removed 10 bags of trash from my apartment. I *still* have 9 other bags waiting to go out, but I’m worried someone will catch on to how much I’ve been unintentionally hoarding."
yes,I don't feel ok for the past few months. I've been dealing with new med side effects and stress at work. I'm about to lose it. All I want to do is to avoid everything and everyone. My existence is pain.
no,"Hello all, coming up on 2 years dysthymia free. Prior to that, I had dysthymia and depression since childhood. I wish to share a few insights and tips that helped me get through dysthymia. I can’t say *exactly* what cured it, if it was a combination of things or some divine intervention. But here’s what helped: ..."
yes,"I already was a little bit down, but now my social anxiety acted up and I can’t bring myself to even think about it without crying of stress. My BF offered to tell his parents I was sick, because he knows of my mental health. But still I could feel an annoyance on his side because he does not really understand it. He cannot comprehend how I feel and how terrifying it is for me."
yes,"Just thinking about it makes me shake with anxiety. And when I'm anxious I shut down. Then I can't do anything. It's all just too much. Way, way, way too much. I want to hide, please, and just float in my own little bubble where there's no more things that I should be doing."
yes,when shit really fucking hits the fan and you start spiraling and your chest feels like it's getting sucked into a black hole and you have no choice but to just. go through it. it's the fucking worst thing ever. the feeling is driving me insane tbh like the usual escapism doesn't work. it's like you're cornered by it.
yes,"I'm used to my mind going in cycles of anxiety and depression. I get propped up by anxiety, and then crash into double-depression. I feel bad for the people that this is affecting. And I'm overwhelmed by managing that change, work, and school. I haven't been able to properly engage in studying or reading. It's been a slog to force myself to get stuff done over the past couple of days. And I woke up this morning just... stuck. And totally, completely, overwhelmingly exhausted. And dissociative and depressed. Like, that full-body depression that feels hollowing and like you'll collapse under your own skin."
yes,"I feel like they somehow form one body, depression and my personality, and I wonder what would be left of my personality if I could somehow cut away my depression from it. I can't help wondering what kind of person I would be had I not been depressed and anxious for so long."
yes,I feel my symptoms have been progressively getting worse and worse and I think it’s time to be prepared to try medication. I’ve been on multiple different anti depressants throughout my teens and had a difficult time with a lot of them.
yes,"I want to be in a good mood, for once. I don't mean ecstatically happy; I just mean I want to have an inner comfort zone that I secure and content."
yes,"my past experiences that shaped my views may happen to me or my loved ones again, and may even happen to me or my loved ones every day for the rest of our lives, will forever hold me back from realizing my potential growth."
yes,Dystymia is like beeing 40 and remembering the times when you were young ... only that it's the time when you weren't depressed its like : the good old times ... when i was happy ...
yes,"I feel like I have a deep lack of desire, I dont know what to do with my life or want anything besides what I already have...I find it hard to not cry...I feel alone and more hard to establish links with other persons...I thought myself as a hyper sensible person or demisexual...low selfstem and what my psychiatrist call a 'basal personality'...I think those things are more symptoms and the cause could be dysthymia..."
no,"From: 10 Practical Ways to Improve Happiness, by Arthur C. Brooks

https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/happiness-research-how-to-be-happy-advice/629559/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=atlantic-daily-newsletter&utm_content=20220421&utm_term=The%20Atlantic%20Daily

“In 2020 an international team of scholars came up with 68 ways that people are commonly counseled to raise their own happiness, then asked 18 of the most distinguished and prolific academic experts on the science of happiness to rate them in terms of effectiveness and feasibility. In other words, according to the experts, these ways to get happier both work and are workable. Here are the top 10, in order:”

1. Invest in family and friends.

2. Join a club.

3. Be active both mentally and physically.

4. Practice your religion
“Religion can be understood more broadly, as a spiritual or philosophical path in life. Search for transcendent truths beyond your narrow day-to-day life.”

5. Get physical exercise.

6. Act nicely.

7. Be generous.

8. Check your health.

9. Experience nature.

10. Socialize with colleagues outside of work.

“This list is quite similar to the advice routinely dispensed by top academics writing for popular audiences….and by nonacademics who were about the science of happiness, such as Gretchen Rubin. ‘These ideas are terrific—and familiar,’ Rubin told me recently. What impressed her wasn’t their originality (your grandmother might’ve told you most of them); rather, it was the fact that they were both effective and practical. ‘For many of us, the bigger challenge isn’t knowing what actions would make us happier, but actually doing those things,’ she said.”

Hope you all have similar reassessing of my health properties as I did. Investing in friends and family and getting involved with literally anything sounds pretty good."
yes,I only got diagnosed with Dysthymia along with ASD this august. One permanent diagnosis that fucking sucks enough as is. But is Dysthymia another permanent disorder too? Am I stuck forever? Just being miserable. Clinging to the good few moments I get? I hate living.
yes,haven't really made a difference. I said that if this didn't work psychedelics were the next logical step. Problem is I won't be able to afford Ketamine and I am not sure how to obtain other things. My OCD tendencies require me to research things to death first
yes,"issues with low energy, fatigue, and poor motivation"
yes,I was laying here wondering if anyone has switched the time of day they took their dose to help with sleep. My theory is that I’m getting a delay in absorption and it’s hitting in the evening causing insomnia.
yes,"it just feels like a drag and a bore to me. I feel like im living Groundhog Day. Nothing makes me happy now, im not interested in doing the things I like, and I dont like talking to people. I often have to put on a mask and hide my depression cus I dont want them to give me sympathy."
yes,"I've been struggling BADLY and just BARELY managing, and from 35 to present, every day gets harder and harder and I'm constantly surprised to find out there is something even lower than the day before. It's not that it's getting worse, but that it isn't relenting. And my symptoms, all the usual suspects, are so much more profound than ever before. I don't have the energy to fight. Or the motivation. If I had either of those things, I'd take a fucking shower more than once a week. Or I'd go back to work. Or, hell, I'd watch a movie from start to finish. If I've no more energy and no more motivation…then what?"
yes,"MDD: - High intensity emotional pain - Anxiety and panic attacks - Terrorising thoughts, like some part of the brain is shouting all the negative things at me - Derealization. Dysthymia: - Irritability - Anhedonia of some sort - Feeling like getting thrown around by the waves of life/like life is out of control"
yes,"I manage to go to work 4 days a week, but I am currently doing a job that is way below my skill level and part time because that’s all I can manage. I shower and eat, but my house is a mess and if I’m not working I spend most of my time laying on the couch because I’ve lost all interest in life."
yes,I mostly feel very bored and unmotivated and have felt that way since I was in high school. Whenever I slip into a lower period it feels like it’s such a slow slide that I hardly even notice I’m slipping until I feel like absolute shit. I feel like I’m on autopilot. The worst part of my depression is that no one seems to notice because I’m a chill and steady person.
yes,is depressed and struggling with it
yes,The problem with dysthymia at least with me is that we feel like a burden. I dont want my unhappiness to permeate into someone else's life. And I dont really have much to discuss. I just don't want to bring other people down with me u know?
no,"To be honest, it was probably a terrible idea to take a break. If you wanna be there for her that's exactly what you should do - BE THERE. Let her vent, talk to her about it or hug her in silence if she doesn't want to talk about it at the time. You wanna make sure that she doesn't feel alone, that she has a safety net, someone to relay on. The worst thing you can do is to pull away and take a break - leaving her alone with her constant struggle of feeling loneliness, ""assuring"" her that she was ""right"" all along, that no one is there for her and she can count on no one. I suggest you apologize and admit to her that it was a terrible idea and you only suggested it because you were clueless about it, but the last thing you want is to make her feel alone - and promise her that it would NEVER happen again. Best of luck to both of you."
no,"Therapy is great, and it sounds like you're being supportive by giving her space to work on herself.
Advice for her: you might need to try multiple therapists to find one that helps. That cold sucks! But if it's not helping, it's not you. Just try a different therapist. Yes, it's exhausting.
Also, I found the podcast The Hilarious World of Depression really useful. It made me feel a lot less alone and weird. Might be useful for both of you.
And take care of yourself too, OP. Being there for someone who's not doing well can be exhausting. (I've been on both sides of it!)
Good luck!"
yes,she’s not into meds but she’s looking into therapy
no,thank you for your help
no,That makes sense. Not an easy situation or a simple answer. Best of luck to you!
yes,I am also still experiencing some real lows. Right at this moment I am filled with annoyance and rage at the universe and I feel powerless to do anything about it.
yes,slip
no,
yes,"I feel like its the story of my life, what I would give to feel not exhausted... to wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I want the energy to engage with my kids properly and not feel like I need to sleep all the time."
yes,"my mental condition have always been below what's normal for other people on a day to day basis, and occasionally I have a depressive episode."
yes,"I go to therapy because I have dysthymia, but I haven't told my friends about it yet, and I'm not sure if I should... I feel alone and misunderstood. I don't want to tell her anything anymore."
yes,"there seem to be some topics and situations related to my work (particularly stuff to do with my PhD dissertation) that very quickly drops me into a spiral of 'There's no point, I'm not good enough, I give up.'"
yes,he doesn't feel like writing back because he's feeling down
no,A coworker just disclosed to me his dysthymia dx. I get a sense that he does not have much of a support system. Please advise me on the best ways I can support him.
yes,"I cried like a little baby, not because of this situation but because I realized that my life has been hell not just because of this illness but because I never was able to overcome my shortcomings in the past, and was criticized to oblivion by my family for not being able to do basic stuff like sleeping, waking up, focusing on studies, etc, and my self-worth plummeted because I felt so useless not being able to achieve it, even if I tried as hard as I could. I feel so fucking sad. Every hour of every day I get random thoughts on how this or that happened because of my self worth. I try to keep distracted to not get this thoughts but I get triggered by the most basic stuff because I relate them to that lack of self worth... I'm just sad all day long."
yes,"I feel like a failure on a daily basis. I want to want to do things but I don't, and sometimes that is the hardest thing to deal with. I hate this, but I feel like life is pointless because all we do is struggle and then die."
yes,"I experiences what I would call delusions... I had delusions that I was cursed, the strongest soul in the universe, that God somehow failed me literally, and that multiple people were going to take me away from my life to live a new one by 'kidnapping' me. I then at one point fell for a scam... I eventually also had my body almost possessed run away from home... I got lost and ended up lying... I also had a delusion where I had intrusive thoughts of being sexually abused... My delusions got so bad I planned out a whole future..."
yes,i couldnt even get excited for ramadan...i still have the thoughts and plans even letters i wrote because i was going to end it this month...i broke apart so many times today...i avoid them...i make myself sleep to avoid any contact...i feel so alone...my depression is killing me inside...im not even a person. im a monster and my depression is killing me inside...i truly do believe i deserve death...i cant find a medication that makes me feel like a zombie. i rather feel like a zombie than this depressed every second...
yes,"I was between feeling guilt, shame, hopelessness, listness and isolation. Self harm/injury has been more prevalent now more than ever. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to feel pain... I've been experiencing anxiety as well, feeling butterflies or drops in my stomach as if I were riding a roller coaster. I'd feel irritable or just extremely down and on the verge of tears. When I feel 'fine' I feel so thankful to be alive, I have reasons to smile and get over excited and grateful for things. It feels like complete euphoria. I can do ANYTHING. It's almost scary experiencing shifts. Recently, I don't feel neutral. I don't feel bad either. I welcome the good things but a part of me just feels like I'm dragging. I'm so inconsistent that it is extremely confusing. I can go out and be social but a part of just isn't actually there. When I get home I just feel so heavy. I want to hide. Get off the grid or even dissapear every now and then. Some days I want to be alone and some days I want to do things. I do get easily discouraged but I don't always let it stop me.... I have been putting off a few things but I try to keep up with responsibilities."
no,"Hello all, The majority of posts on here are negative(which makes sense) but I thought I’d share my “success story” to hopefully give everyone some hope that they too can overcome this horrible illness. ... "
no,https://preview.redd.it/21b9lidf92f71.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=83de64a9523285f58c56fced3e7afb4cd4604919
yes,I've always been very hard on myself to be this perfect ideal... I wonder if my thirst for perfection stems from my low sense of self worth and a need to over-compensate for my perceived inadequacies.
no,"Hi guys, I noticed that here is rarely discussed this particular med. I know that it is not approved in the States for..reasons, but it can be very effective. It has to be a dose ranging from 12.5 to 50mg, generally. It acts very quickly on both PDD and anxiety. The downside could be: (reversible) prolactin raise (with prolonged usage), and of course tolerance. It is technically an antipsychotic but at these dosages it acts in the opposite way, thus raising dopamine (antagonism at the D2 auto-receptor) Same goes , albeit with a slight different mechanism, and a different side effects profile, for low doses aripiprazole (dopamine receptor partial agonist). Lurasidone and cariprazine too, probably. Remember we are always talking about very low dosages. I can personally attest that low dose amisulpride works, and in facts here it is sold (also) in the 50mg formulation with the specific indication for dysthymia. Hope it helps Best wishes"
yes,"I've told my friends that I have dysthymia, and sometimes it shows. Sometimes when I'm out with them panga of depression hit and it's hard to his and come out of. ... my mind tells me 'Look her her being strong, not like you you little bitch' and stuff. Just makes me feel like more of a loser."
yes,Been on Zoloft for 5 years and it’s amazing for my anxiety but has no effect on my depression. Highest dose of Wellbutrin did nothing. Currently on Modafinil but feel hardly any difference.
yes,always struggled with making friends and just a feeling of sadness without being able to explain why. Just feeling empty randomly no matter what I do. Currently on a tropical beach and just couldn't help but feel anxious and sad. I just don't understand how life can be so good but I still feel broken and dead inside.
yes,"i have a sense of despair and feel so alone so deeply, i have a sense that my life is pointless, that i will never connect with people, i don't have nobody and i am alone... i sense this lows like 'wake up' moments, like i see my reality so pure that is truly an hell, and feel like my baseline mood is numb so i can go on with life without much thinking about, but when i have those moments of low, i can feel all my life coming at once, i feel my chest burning almost, i get short breath, and get freezed just thinking and wanting to end it all"
no,Hello! Has anyone had success with lamictal? Thanks!
yes,"I have chronic treatment resistant depression, GAD, OCD and derealization disorder. Usually the majority of the time I dwell in my thoughts, I don't want to get up from bed, I feel horrible especially when I go out... But sometimes... I felt ok and kinda energetic, talkative, smiling, participating to the event. I was sad and worried when it was over, with the anxious thought of returning back to the dark."
yes,"I have been suffering of PDD co-morbid with ADD and high functioning anxiety since about 20years but only got diagnosed 2 yrs back. Before going into therapy, I used to write a lot as an outlet and the writings were typically pessimistic."
yes,my highest in years was 4/10 and that only happend a couple of times. At 0/10 I put suicide. It's the lowest of the lows.
yes,"I can't remember when I wasn't depressed. As a kid I was neglected, emotionally abused, and forced into a religion that told me that everything I thought was evil. I have to push myself just to interact with people at the store when I'm running errands. I anticipate this happening so I try to avoid people. I get irritated just walking out my front door into the world."
no,"I just wanted to share that before tonight I was skeptical of crisis chat lines, and I tried it out and I felt very heard and understood. For anybody on the fence, it’s worth it to try if you’re in a crisis. Here’s the text line I used (I hate talking on the phone): https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/"
yes,"I recall feeling this “lingering sadness”, as someone here in this sub has put it. I’ve always been sad and melancholic. And maybe being melancholic alone might not be a symptom of depression, but I’ve never felt actually happy with my life, no matter what I do or try, so combined with that… Yeah maybe that is not how a child should feel. There was always this hole inside of me that I could run away from for a short time but it always comes back. ... I’m more or less apathetic to life. It is okay for me to be alive, I do enjoy some things, there are things that are worth living for I guess which in and of itself is something! But if I died it would be sad but also Idc"
yes,I seem to always have an unexpected bad mental day when a significant event comes up
yes,my eyes just focus on one spot and then I just start zoning out and it’s really hard to stop it from happening
yes,"My anxiety has been through the roof, and with the “highs” of that stress comes the lows of sadness and just complete exhaustion. I’ve been having panic attacks over projects, making mistakes and then retreating into myself and/or crying in the bathroom."
yes,I need something to fight for...
yes,"i feel like i'm never living in the present. always reminiscing about the past or dreaming and planning for the future. i am so fucking lonely, disappointed in myself, insecure, self hating, tired."
yes,"I'm tired of feeling worthless, I yearn for death and hate that it's so hard to achieve. I mess up my attempts every time."
yes,"I can’t stop crying, I feel like he’s going to leave me. I feel like my social capacity is at a negative right now when all I want to do is have fun with our friends. I’m 30 and have never felt this hopeless. I’m starting to feel like this illness will eventually get the better of me and be the death of me."
yes,"It sounds like you may have dysthymia, or this could just be your personality. I'm not sure what I can do to help you, but if you would just like someone to talk to we can schedule more visits."
yes,I'm feeling the best I've felt in 15 years and everyone wants to invalidate it because it doesn't follow their individual spin on what I should be doing.
no,Does anyone get some relief using Sativa dominant strains of cannabis? I've found some good results with one strain specifically  so far and wounder if anyone else might have found that Sativas have this effect on them?
yes,I was so far behind on group work and the guilt was crushing me. I had feelings of guilt and subsequent apathy for now
yes,"I didnt feel like I had to drag myself to live, but almost burdenless, like other people seem to be."
yes,"When my grandma died, I was 12 and that was the first direct experience I had with loss. Initially I had frequent, recurring dreams in which somehow she was still alive; some of them even had elaborate plans and conspiracies as to how she faked her death and came back from terminal lung cancer. These dreams would be ecstatic, until I woke up — then, it would be even worse."
yes,"I've been holding in a lot of frustration, worry, depression, and anxiety, and it's leaking out...These are things completely out of my control and I have to let them run their course...I just can't mentally manage it anymore...it just made it worse and their words hurt me...It's making it hard to open up to the ones that do need to know what's going on...It's so frustrating!"
yes,"I feel like I've totally lost empathy. Whenever my partner or my family shares some bad news such as a family member being diagnosed with some illness or someone has died, I don't feel anything. I want to care and I do but it just doesn't feel enough since I don't feel some sort of sadness or anything alike."
yes,"I've been wavering between not totally shit-eating awful, but not exactly manageably ok, either. It's worst during the in-betweens, but lately, it's omnipresent... I just... Don't know what to do. I take meds. I haven't been to therapy in 6 months. Maybe it's time to go back."
yes,I just feel sad. I feel disconnected from others on an emotional level. It’s hard to concentrate sometimes. My self-esteem is negatively impacted. I feel like I'm in the strange position of wishing I could trade my suffering for something that was short term and more intense. I've come to know many people who have never met me without pdd. I'm in the game but it's hard for me to make an impact.
yes,"I'll be miserable alone, you'll be miserable with someone"
yes,I feel inferior to the person you are dating because you can’t see your own self worth
no,Absolutely not. I’ve thought about this exact statement before and I’ve come to my own conclusion. To each their own I guess in this belief.
yes,it's very easy to let a relationship sink when you're depressed...I had the mindset that they couldn't possibly understand what I was going through
yes,I think I won't love my life. I've been working on me. I have only been able to be content for a small amount of time. I think that's progress. I still don't see myself loving someone till I can be truly content. I also don't want to be alone so I am in a pickle.
yes,"Mind you, it's perfectly fine to feel that way. Especially for us."
yes,"I was condicioned from very early to seek ""that"" person that would make everything right, that would make all the problems disappear, that would sooth the fire and dirt in my mind..."
no,I mean you'll run into a lot more relationship issues if you don't. But I would definitely recommend putting more focus into your self love journey than your romantic one. I promise you the self love is the most important relationship you can have anyways.
no,No. But it is true for compassion. You have to have compassion for yourself before you can have compassion for someone else.
no,"I think you should have an amount of self-love/self-respect so you don't get attached to your partner or seek their attention all the time, but there's also no ""perfect"" or right time to start dating and you shouldn't let a diagnosis keep you from enjoying the dating world and deserving a partner"
yes,Its taken a lot of thinking and therapy and just sitting with being uncomfortable with myself and letting myself feel that and accept the reality of it for me to start feeling like I’m on the route to self-healing and self love.
yes,dysthymia
yes,you're more open to abuse and manipulation because you don't value yourself. Like: you treat your partner badly because you can't see past your own pain.
no,"i guess it depends and it's not an everyone thing on whether it would work or not but im just going to say that the right person will make you fall in love with yourself too but for that to happen communicating your feelings and needs to allow your partner to support you is so impt, let them know how they could help you and if you need them ard or if you need space etc. and dont blame your partners for your mood and if they arent providing you with the right type of support you could always let them know i guess being self-aware of your needs plays a part in this there's alot more things but rlly talking it out and sharing goes a long way staying true to yourself and trying to be open with your feelings instead of hiding it also helps. i feel that a relationship  shouldnt change you but instead aid you to grow. you could take a look at @realdepressionproject on like facebook, instagram, tiktok with your partner or share posts that are applicable to them it might help you both on the communication and understanding aspect i rlly love their content and it's been helping me :))"
yes,"I think when you are dealing with depression it’s hard having a relationship because you don’t have a lot of energy available to deal with life ... I think that’s what makes dating so overwhelming sometimes . Even if you come to terms with who you are and what you are dealing , sometimes you might feel it’s imposible to make someone else happy"
yes,I'd take my meds to manage my depression and anger... I'm consumed by anger... I have to pop pills everyday to just deal with living which you've always hated...
yes,So my whole life I've been quite anxious and apathetic... I started getting the occasional week(s) of clinical depression... I'm back to my old apathetic self and constantly tired again.
yes,I've dealt with some form of depression on and off and with varying degrees of severity for about fifteen years
yes,"I got depressed. Oh, the 'what if's came full force. I figured out why this triggered me and sent me into a spiral that I'm still battling."
yes,it makes me sad because i just want to kill myself & i feel like now i can’t
yes,"i have been battling depression for a long time, ive been diagnosed with major depressive disorder since 16. im 22 now and my psychiatrist says i have double depression. both mdd and pdd, we have tried all the ssris multiple times, all the snris, mood stabilizers, and even gabapentin. im epileptic so we keep repeating medications but because my psychiatrist has seen me exhaust every treatment in attempt to end my depressive episodes he says we have to try medication outside the box. maybe even use medications that are off label because of the double depression."
yes,"i'm so aware of my entire body and every physical sensation that when there is a slight shift, i'm alerted and i'm convinced something is wrong with me. something always feels wrong with me. i wake up feeling like i havent slept, and i float through the day as though i havent woken up from a dream."
yes,"My negative thoughts overrun me and I'm constantly pushing back the stuff I really need to make, like postponing something painful. ... my mind keeps drifting to situations lived at that time. ... I feel I can't contribute anything new. ... I feel I left my life run its way without a real purpose. ... I feel like someone who had a lot of potential but never really amounted to anything."
yes,I can literally feel it coming. That feeling of dread and slowly sinking into self-despair. I hate it. I hate that I can’t control it. I hate how everything in my life suddenly loses all meaning.
yes,Sometimes I have days where getting out of bed and taking care of myself is too big of a task to manage...but sometimes I don't think I even try to attempt to take care of myself. It's like the thought doesn't even occur to me. I worry that I've become too comfortable with being depressed.
yes,"The dysthymia has been feeling more like a deep depression of late, exacerbated by several factors including immense stress, a friend's suicide, friends drifting, and a lack of anyone to speak to who truly understands what I'm feeling. I don't really want to kill myself but I think I wouldn't mind going if it's not of my own doing... I'm starting to feel immensely hopeless and my symptoms aren't like they were before: there's so much trouble concentrating and I have frequent moments where I feel like I'm an observer of my own body."
yes,"I'm a 29 y/o student studying my first year out of 3. I'll always been kind of a ''gray'' guy, which means my mood is always somewhere in between. I rarely feel very happy, neither do I feel very sad, always somewhere in between. My motivation for starting stuff is really bad and I'd like to try some things to boost it. My libido is also very low at the moment. But I'd really like a kick in the butt and paint some colors to my life and wanting to socialise, I'm kind of tired of being gray."
yes,I had a bad childhood with abuse and trauma...I got diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety. Sometimes I feel like there is no point in anything...his behaviour reminds me of my traumatic childhood and I freeze or get into a complete struggle with my (now manageable) insomnia.
yes,persistent case of low-level depression with a high level of productivity but with occasional bouts of deeper depression
yes,"I'm starting to feel like there's something defective with me. My partner has a theory...he thinks my dysthymia and ADHD affect my appetite, which causes issues with my IBS and migraines, which in turn weakens my immune system, which is why I keep getting sick. I'm on good meds for my dysthymia, and I recenty got on meds for my ADHD, just need to get them better balanced."
yes,"i’ve lived so many years of my life with lethargy, unable to make decisions and without actually feeling happy/excited. i can do so much, but it just doesn’t let me."
yes,I’ll go about my day as if I am the only person I know that’s alive and that no one cares about me and that nothing matters. It’s like this veil of depression sort of casts over me.
yes,I have suffered from dysthymia for atleast 8 years now. Almost went suicidal 3 years ago...
yes,Last meeting she told me “just try it.” Like omg wow you just solved all my problems. Obviously my nutritionist isn’t going to know I have mental illnesses but like hearing just do this or just try that is so infuriating.
yes,"I'm relieved, and also struggling to trust that the floor isn't going to fall out from under me again...I have had so many medication failures that I really am struggling to imagine that something could actually help me anymore. On top of that I'm also experiencing a serious drop in executive functioning over the past week or so."
yes,"I feel that I live my life in a gray fog. I have been unhappy as long as I can remember. I always thought that is was normal and that everyone must have this weight on their mind. To have a voice constantly telling you you are worthless or hopeless. *I cannot find pleasure in any hobbies, “being bored with everything ever” seems to come up whenever I try and entertain myself. *i have barely a lebito and do not show much affection *I crave interaction with people but see no point *I have constant and unending self criticism *I am never happy, just momentary elevated."
yes,I feel like a burden...exhausting having to deal with illness
yes,Between my shoulders inside my body it feels like there is a big energetical blockage. I can feel relieve and I start to yawn a lot. But it never disappaers. I'm not fighting it but the stucked feeling inside is not enjoyable.
yes,I got thrown into an episode this morning because I thought about how one fucking saxophone has to do with an entire pandemic & I don’t even know if the sax will do anything to make me feel better.
yes,"i’m exhausted. truly drained, burnt out, im suffocating. ive told my psychiatrist i quit therapy and he says he thinks that i made a rational and healthy decision. ive been doing it for 5+ years and it doesnt work for me. im running on empty and hurting. please. im trying."
yes,"when i masturbate to porn my mental health takes a hit, my symptoms are worse than before, low confidence, low energy, don't concentrate on goals"
yes,"I feel like I don't enjoy anything... I don't know if it's anhedonia or what. A lack of friends may play a role... My life is being miserable at work, then being miserable at home. Repeat."
yes,"I have had mild depression for years... suddenly i am very sad for no reason, it not like i was thinking about something that gets me down, just thinking about normal work stuff."
yes,"I was diagnosed with dysthymia at age 8. ... It’s never gotten better. ... I don’t enjoy anything to begin with, ... There is no relief, ever. ... Otherwise, I don’t give a fuck about anything. It’s just survival. No joy."
yes,I've been having depressive symptoms (especially suicidal ideation) since 2020... I spend most of my day feeling gravely sad and crying for no reason. I barely bath and binge eating junk food. I feel like I could harm myself physically anytime. I've been uncontrollably harming myself physically ever since I was 12. I'd rather kill myself happily.
yes,I've also been distressed these past 3 weeks. I would like to be accurate about how troubled I feel now and have been feeling before this added distress.
yes,"I've always described entering double depression as not having as far to fall. I'm already halfway down, so the fall to the ground isn't quite as painful. And climbing up to my 'normal' isn't quite as far as it is for someone with non-chronic depression."
yes,"I remember feeling a pressure on the chest, like i couldn't breathe fully... I remember feeling so scared about even existing, i was in bed thinking about my whole life, everything felt like hell, i was paranoid about every person in my life, i was almost convinced they was just thinking i was handicapped, i was thinking that i failed in life and the future would be me homeless and so i was taking relief thinking about ending my existence."
yes,The problem with bipolar disorder is that the episodes are chemically based (in theory) and unpredictable. (Both my ex wife and 2nd wife are bipolar. It's a roller coaster if untreated.)
yes,"I felt like I was in a years-long depressive episode...I still find it hard to notice when a depressive episode starts and stops...My depression is very much of the 'with atypical features' variety pretty much always...I appear unemotional to other people a lot of the time, but I am most certainly more emotional than the average person (I have BPD also which should give you an idea lol)...I've been making progress with regards to splitting lately, and apparently when people with BPD start to overcome splitting, repression increases...I went totally emotionally flat...I am used to being smacked in the face repeatedly by my emotions, the feeling of feeling nothing is totally alien to me and made me extremely uncomfortable."
yes,"Personally, I've rarely had suicidal thoughts. Sure, 'I didn't ask to be born', 'it'd be easier', 'what am I doing here?', etc, but I always find enough energy to keep going. Largely I can't imagine what it would be like for my family and friends. It helps to look at the bigger picture."
no,"Yo that little future you talk about is so much bigger than we think. That's the drive. You never know what's coming so might as well stick around to find out, since it might be excellent as much as it might not."
yes,"your average dysthymic has low self esteem, and seemingly your average MDD person has low self esteem mostly only when in a depressive episode"
yes,"I've definitely had periods where I feel my dysthymia is very severe, but because of the specific symptoms I have and my grasp on executive functioning, it wouldn't present that way to a psychiatrist at first blush. I have a flatter affect, lower emotional capacity, chronic suicidal ideation, fatigue, and occasionally rumination."
yes,it almost sounds as if dysthymia is evolution. Not that we are resilient but we have greater tolerance for the lows that it doesn't often throw our daily lives out of wack
yes,I struggle mightily with being happy with myself. I don’t think I went a day thinking that I was still depressed. Since she started to lose interest through now has been such a hard time and I struggle mightily with being happy with myself.
yes,I have had moments of my life where I am just extremely unmotivated and almost apathetic to everything...I feel talking to people is getting so difficult right now as I feel like when I’m not successful and working hard I have no way to relate.
yes,"I have struggled with mental health issues for almost 10 yrs, on my own...I stopped taking the meds and convinced myself that it was a misdiagnosis...I think my quality of life could be better if i tried meds but I won’t go to a psychiatrist because I think maybe I am exaggerating and I don’t actually have anything."
yes,"I’m fucking exhausted, I’ve been finding it impossible to reach out more and more these days and I don’t wanna cry out for help to seem desperate but I don’t know what else to do at this point, I’ve tried therapy I’ve tried talking it out hell I’m even medicated, but nobody seems to get it or understand everyone just seems so fixated on their own lives and maybe that’s selfish of me to say but I guess what I need rn is some sorta change in life. But I’m at a point where I can’t make that jump, maybe tomorrow will be better but I’m constantly terrified of it being worse."
yes,"I'm struggling to understand if my low mood is due to my Dysthymia or complex trauma. I was triggered and feeling low and avoidant. Yet, the self criticism, hopelessness, and despair is not here and that's why I know esketamine is working for me."
no,Thank you and I am happy it is helping.
no,"Please also consider exercise, and psychotherapy, 8f one therapist didn't work for you try another one, If cbt doesn't work maybe dbt or ipt likely to help"
yes,they asked how my meds were doing treating my dysthymia and if I was doing anything to actively manage my anxiety
yes,"I shared how hard things have felt and I’ve been feeling really low. I even shared some thoughts of self harm. ...it feels confusing to me that he says he’s there for me, but in the moment he just freezes... It makes me feel so much more alone... I’m trying to show myself the support I want by taking care of myself, but it just sucks I’m the only one who seems to care."
yes,"I've had flashes of derealization for over a decade, but now it's constantly on my mind. I'm frightened and I don't know what to do."
yes,Ive had dysthymia since 2016... I crashed in a MDD episode. This is my second one. Basically its really destroying my life. I just cant function
yes,"I have no drive or motivation to do anything, ever... I don’t want to go anywhere else. I’ll cancel even plans I’m looking forward to. I’ll shower only when I can’t stand to look at myself anymore. I don’t want people to come over because my house is never ‘company ready’. Aside from taking care of my cats, going to work and doing the absolute bare minimum to keep myself alive, I live in my bed."
no,"Tomorrow is a new same day. Don’t worry, you’re normal- everyone knows time is still."
yes,"I feel like everyone I see in the streets have it better than me, although in reality I know this is not true I can't help to have these negative feelings, I believe what triggered it was the security guard at sprouts greeted me very casually and all the other folks he was very formal, I know it's silly but it's little things like this that trigger me."
yes,"My psychiatrist never experienced dysthymia, never tried ssri medicaments. Her knowledge is from books and other people's reports."
yes,it feels like every skill point that you spent yesterday to acquire new skills is just reseted...I don’t get how to gain knowledge? experience? new skills?
yes,"I feel like I am kind of stuck in a loop right now I guess, I feel like my life is miserable. I've been struggling with depression/dysthymia for maybe 5-6 years?. I don't really do much in my day anymore, just sit on my computer and do whatever is interesting. I struggle to even look at my school work because it just scares me so bad because I am so behind... Honestly at this point I really don't know what I have. I've been diagnosed with so many things... GAD, Dysthymic Disorder, Dysthymia, Major Depressive Disorder.."
yes,"I am a woman of 24 and I've had depression for as long as I can remember. I could still do some basics, but everything felt tired and empty. I think it broke me. I became a shell of my former, wellbutrin-revived self. I spiraled. I stayed in my apartment for a long time. My memories of that time are unclear and unfocused. I still haven't recovered the pieces of myself I lost that day. I should be running around, doing things like I did once. I should have come back to life again. I've been trying to reason with myself, to discover the root cause of this behavior, but I come up empty. Even this level of nothingness is new for me. I used to be able to force it, even on really bad days. But I can't do it. My brain locks me out."
yes,the overarching feeling in my brain since 1999
no,Agreed.
yes,I live with constant dysthymia and dissociation. I can't feel anything.
yes,"I never realized it could be like that, like there was no fog, and I was OK for once. Still felt a little down, but nothing like the past 20 years that I though everyone lived like. I always thought that was the best it got. I would have down swing in to MDD, get on meds, itd pass, and I would go back to just to this 'this kinda sucks but I can weather it.'"
yes,"My ego null, my passion void; Medicated by the muck himself; What draws me back but thickened blood? What denies the dark but ledgers' mark? Not pity, not hope, not sight of light But the constant tumult And lack of voice"
yes,"I was told i was treatment resistant. ... It would need a lot of therapy, mindfulness sessions. I tried but then I'm alone with no family or friends and it again intensifies so i just stopped everything."
no,"Possibly. Some people find something that works. Most treatments/medication is temporary. Keep trying, though."
yes,"In my experience, dysthymia is hard to treat. Especially if you have been suffering for a long time. I was a 15 year sufferer before I was able to walk outside and appreciate a beautiful day."
yes,Medications are not enough to treat dysthymia. They work for some time and then stops. Then you have to switch to an alternative and the same happens.
no,"4yrs of CBT (and exposure therapy for my SA) was what finally worked for me.

I had been on and off SO many medications, that I took myself off of due to side effects.

I have not been on any meds for roughly 10yrs, and have not seen any therapist for about 4yrs, and I would say I'm doing well. I still get depressive episodes, but the self awareness of my condition, as well as the mindfulness tools that therapy gave me, make them so much more manageable. Episodes will last a day or two, three tops, whereas they used to be months-years long.

I'm not trying to say that what worked for me will necessarily work for you, just trying to point out that while it is/can be a struggle, don't give up.

There can be a light at the end of the tunnel, you just have to keep pushing past the candles in the darkness."
yes,I’m treatment resistant according to 3 docs.
yes,Haven't met a therapist I thought was any good. I'm just gonna stop seeking treatment.
no,Please share for our benefit also what solution worked for you?
no,Could you DM?
yes,I can't even get them where I am
no,Look into TMS & ECT treatment.
no,I’ll DM you
no,"Seems like BS. The only interesting study about this treatment regarding Major Depressive Disorder is this one, conducted by Neuronetics Inc., the company selling the TMS devices"
no,Please DM me too
yes,I'm still struggling
no,"Ok, but we are talking about dysthymia, not major depressive disorder…
There’s documented success from both treatments. Not sure what you’re researching."
no,Sent
no,Yes
no,"Alright, PDD and MDD are different ; we both know that.
Please, let me know of the studies you found proving the efficiency of both techniques regarding dysthymia.
I wanna know what **you** are *researching*"
no,I’m not going to assemble a bibliography for you… There are numerous peer-reviewed articles on the National Library of Medicine and the Mayo Clinic websites.
yes,Didn't sleep much last night and really feeling the Nothing hitting hard today
yes,it worsened my condition. It put me even in worse condition than dysthymia
yes,"if depressed people could get a wish, they'd wish for the ability to stop time, so they could figure out some things in their personal life. Some would wish to start a whole new life or start over their own life. Some would wish for a dear one to come back, whether a family member or a friend."
yes,"I have dysthymia, I lose that peace of mind, I don’t want to do anything, I’m so sick so tired so done of WORK every fuckin time to live!, I feel stupid and I don’t know what to do anymore this week it so similar to time I was diagnosed I feel I’m loosing my mind again"
yes,"It feels like a punch in the gut, it feels like I'm being dumped. I'm angry and I'm scared. Scared to find someone new. And I'm not excited to unpack my issues to someone else. I know she has every right to leave, and I support her because she wants to focus on her family and private practice. I'm just so lost. I feel like I'm losing my best friend."
yes,I feel upset about everything all at once. I didn’t get this and that done again. I feel overwhelmed by that. And then all I want to do is just cry. And die.
yes,"I will have a plan and I will carry it out. Not sure if I'm in crisis if my plan is for further down the line but if life keeps on like this (as it has for the past 40 years), I'm not going to make past 50."
yes,"fall asleep around 6 PM, and wake up at 4 in the morning filled with dread and self-hatred"
yes,"I am exhausted after my day job and i barely have the energy to get myself home. ... it feels like there is never ending amount of things to do just to be able to live. ... Sometimes, i just want to close my eyes and disappear."
no,"Recently, I requested a copy of my medical records as I have to change psychiatrists. I was reading through the notes, all from a few years ago when I was finally first medicated. I was really struck by how I had kind of forgotten how much medication has changed my life.

I've been taking Zoloft for about three years now, since my senior year of college.  Prior, I had been suffering from dysthymia for at least five years. I was still able to function and excel, so people didn't understand the extent of my depression...even I thought I must have been overreacting to my underreactions.

I'm still not quite where I want to be mental health-wise. But reading the notes in my record, how my anxiety and depression had ""remarkably improved,"" how my family and friends noticed, how I said ""it has changed everything,"" reminds me of how grateful I am that my baseline has improved so much. It's so easy to lose sight of mental health progress. I've come a long way.

Hang in there, friends."
yes,I have brain fog and my brain feels empty all the time. My psychiatrist says i have poverty of thought. This makes it so hard for me to communicate with other people. I can’t think on the spot and so I have fail every interview i have ever sat. I don’t have friends for the same reason.
yes,"I genuinely can't feel anything, I can cry and everything but I'm just dull in my head, it's more of an act, but that isn't even the biggest problem, it's just that I barely can do anything, especially in school, I can't even do the most basic things."
yes,"Today totally sucked, can barely get off the couch and crying over trying to accomplish a few basic tasks."
no,"There used to be a diagnosis called depressive personality disorder (DPD) in the DSM-III & DSM-IV. The main reason for it's removal was not that it didn't exist, but because it's so hard to distinguish from dystymia. The DSM-5 introduced PDD to bundle dysthymia with chronic major depression, double depression and DPD. So why does that matter? Dystymia is a mood disorder and DPD is a personality disorder, and having the wrong diagnosis can mean you are getting the wrong help. CBT is quite effective in treating mood disorders through behavioral activation while schema therapy and psychodynamic therapies are best for PDs. Cause and effect are mirrored: if you suffer from DPD, your mood suffers from your thoughts and beliefs about yourself; if you suffer from dysthymia your thoughts and beliefs about yourself suffer under your low mood. To heal long term, you need to work on the causes, not the symptoms. How to find out if you have dysthymia or DPD? It's common for both disorders to have fluctuations in mood, and by analyzing your thoughts and beliefs and how they change you can make an educated guess. On good days you might have improved mood and hope and almost feel 'normal'. If your self-esteem improves on those days it's most likely that you are suffering from dysthymia because your self esteem depends on your mood. Also, if the symptoms started in/after your twenties, it's undoubtedly a mood disorder. If you have early-onset PDD and always have low self esteem - feeling inadequate and worthless even if your mood increases, it's most likely a personality disorder. If you have tried therapy and felt like you were stuck and nothing improved even though you really tried, you might be struggling not from dysthymia but DPD. I hope this wasn't too dry and theoretical, but I thought it's important to know."
yes,"when i look back into my past memories, i feel like most of it are blurry and patchy. Some memories seems to lack feeling, like i have the memory but it feels lifeless."
yes,"high irritability towards family and friends, where you’re constantly annoyed with them even though they’re not really doing anything"
yes,"i went to the psychiatrist to talk about my lethargy, focus and not being able to work on my full potential issue. they diagnosed me with dysthymia"
yes,"I've had persistent tiredness for 10 years, gotten worse in the past 5 years, and really bad in the past 2 years. I never feel well rested or refreshed, yawn constantly, and always feel low energy."
yes,"I started to question my gender identity. I was in a *happy* state and was pretty sure about myself. Never felt that good ! But now that I am in the *despair* state of the cycle, I start having some doubts."
yes,"the thought of having to be “on” for a week, having to carry on conversations, having enough energy for the things they want to do….. it seems too overwhelming. i honestly just had a breakdown thinking about it and picturing it."
yes,"Recently, I got diagnosed with dysthymia"
yes,I've (23M) consciously had Dysthymia for 9 years ... and recently it had just been getting worse and worse day by day to the point where I couldn’t leave my apartment for 3 days and was starting to have suicidal thoughts creep back in.
yes,"Even on “good days,” I feel numb, sad/hallow, and unfulfilled. Just general unease all the time. ... I hate feeling like this... incessantly thinking about my plan for how I would commit suicide."
yes,"I was low. Real low. Like I was trying to convince myself to distance myself from friends and family so I could kill myself, guilt free."
yes,"I was diagnosed with dysthemia today itself. Depressive symptoms were always there but i thought they were caused by adhd, turns out it was the other way around. Along with this i also have trouble controlling impulses."
yes,"I joined this sub not too long ago when I found out I have double depression... ive been trying for over 6 years, I am also epileptic... my mental well being hasn't been well in a very long time now."
yes,I just don't really know what I did when I got home from school yesterday...
yes,"I started with SH and every two/three months I have bad suicidal thoughts. I don't want to die, I'm just too tired. I'm always tired. every step I take is very, very heavy. I'm eating a lot more than before, and I just wanna sleep. "
no,"This sucks, but we're here - together. Thank you for existing."
yes,tried stims for a year...making me so depressed; feel foggy / tired / like I'm not functioning at my best; issues with motivation / getting started on projects / staying focused on them; not so much in the way of sadness; a vague feeling of hopelessness
yes,"I only seem to 'exist' when I'm all alone... When everyone is goes to bed, then I feel like I'm ready to 'start my day'."
yes,"I wake up and cry every morning. ...i feel numb, lost, empty and like i can't get through the day, i don't feel the need to go out with friends but i do because i don't want to disappoint anyone but i don't have fun,so i just wait for night time and going to bad and cry again. I have to be honest i have suicidal thoughts but i know i'll never do it."
yes,I stopped after three years and erased my gains which will happen if you don't keep up.
no,"I haven't read too much about it, but it sounds a bit like Cbt, does it feel that way?"
yes,"chronically depressed people operate at a pre-logical level in their interpersonal interactions. Essentially they approach their interactions with others in the same way small children do, they don't realize there is a relationship between how they are responding to people and then not getting what they want."
no,"Thanks, this is very helpful. I've never felt my interpersonal relationships were a problem, but I'll give it a try."
yes,I don't take any medication for my dysthymia
yes,"I just cried over the stupidest thing, but my hopes were brought up to be slammed down on the ground. It is overwhelming and probably affected me more than the average person. It’s exhausting."
yes,does it affect your romantic attraction to people
yes,I just feel this undercurrent of ‘bleh’ that’s hard to describe... The emptiness comes back quickly once things become routine.
yes,"I am diagnosed with dysthymia and major depression... I have no hope for the future. To be honest thinking about the future scares me. It is a black pit of despair. I feel like I live my life in 'Hard Mode', while everyone else breezes through life easily."
yes,"I feel that…what keeps them living. I shared that for me it’s my cats. Well I wasn’t sad, BUT I AM NOW."
yes,"Imagine you're trying to drive a car from Massachusetts to California. You get your car ready, fill it up with gas, plug in the directions to your GPS and start driving. All is going well, you make it past New York, into Pennsylvania and then you notice your GPS is starting to have problems. Your GPS will randomly shut off for random periods of time, reroute you in the wrong direction and change your ETA. This is my depression."
yes,I'm constantly performing in social situations. I do love and care about my friends but subconsciously I feel very alone and it feels kind of performative when I hang out with them. I feel like they dont get to really experience the real me and I've struggled in romantic situations because it's hard to be able to feel anything but sadness/anger/fear in such an intimate place.
yes,my mind continuously wanders off (usually to negative places)
yes,"I have to shame, guilt, and reprimand myself to get things started, let alone done."
yes,"I am scared I could harm myself. I am alone, depressed, anxious, sad and get an occassional panic attack where I am crying so much because it feels as if I will never get out of this again. I want it to end but I don't wanna die. But I also don't have the energy to fight anymore."
yes,had several failed relationships and I wonder if it's possible for a person with dysthymia to be successful in terms of dating

yes,I've been dealing with dysthymia since at least highschool. In the last couple months my symptoms have gotten worse. I've tried medication two times before but didn't really see much change.
yes,"My husband has dysthymia...he is beginning therapy, has switched to a low-carb diet which has helped A LOT, has quit caffeine which has also helped, and is doing CPTSD work that seems to also be helping."
yes,"Hi, I was diagnosed with dysthymia over a year ago, my life long depression worsened after a breakdown and I became suicidal for the first time, but now I'm scared of moving on because I fear having a relapse and being suicidal again, to feel like I'm not in control of my mind again, to be dominated by those horrific intrusive thoughts."
yes,Concentration is horrible; focus is terrible. Today I worked out of my home office and I barely managed to get 30 mins of work done all day.
yes,"My depression has been severe for about two years, with brief moments of relief. I have struggled with depression since as long as I can remember. 30 or so years now. Right now greatest struggle is getting through just one more day. Personal hygiene is tough. Focusing on work is difficult. There is nothing so routine about my life right not where I can attach something as important as taking medication to it on a regular basis. I am missing my therapy appointments. I resent and feel disconnected from my partner. The realization that this is my life not for now, but forever is soul crushing."
yes,"I wake up exhausted, put on a mask to interact, sometimes I feel energised by my interactions but after a while I’m down again. I’m fighting to do my job, to present a normal facade, to get a little exercise, not to eat crap, not to drink, not to self harm, to be who my family expects, to be a friend to other people who struggle and maintain other relationships too."
yes,AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
yes,generally disliking who I am
yes,Can’t stop thinking of drowning myself there and feeling guilty for thinking about it.
yes,"It takes great effort to smile and nod, say affirmatives like 'yeah!' or 'right?', or do a little chuckle because it doesn't feel like a natural reaction"
yes,"I just found out this is my diagnosis, and feel hopeless, what is point in life If I’m always going to struggle if il always be sad."
yes,I get depressed that we have come to accept living under these conditions. ...don’t think I can afford that
yes,my mental state is a blur
yes,"I have good weeks and even (rarely) months, but the very low mood just hits me over and over again. It’s definitely not a mild mood disorder in my case, but it goes in waves and I’ve had it since I was around 14-15."
yes,thinking of different ways how to describe this horrible experience even though I rarely if ever tell anyone how the real extent of how I actually feel..
yes,I feel like a defective person. Nothing seems to go right even when you try your absolute hardest. It is uphill battle with no hope of reaching the top. I can never escape the trauma and environment that caused me to have these awkward personality traits. The demons are always lurking behind me. Today I returned my helium tank and siphon tube I was gonna use to take my own life but I'm thinking of buying it back and following through. I really wish this wasn't the only way. I'm afraid of death too but there is no other escape to the pain
yes,"with PDD and bipolar 2 diagnoses, I know I’ll be handling this for the long haul"
yes,I feel so disgusting about it and I hate myself for it
no,"Any advice on how to overcome lack of motivation etc to exercise consistently? Just do it for 10 minutes, make yourself answerable to someone else, pay for it is not working."
yes,I've wanted to get my psych degree since I dropped out of college 7ish years ago due to my garbage mental health. ... I dropped out of college the first time because I had a mental breakdown. So much was going on at the time. ... I've wanted to get my psych degree ... But I'm always worried that my dysthymia and other mental health stuff will sabotage my ability to do this.
yes,I spend a fair share of my time thinking about suicide. I wasn’t able to feel any satisfaction from my projects and works... I also can’t enjoy any activity... I have been dead inside since covid or so... I have depressive symptoms in a summer break.
yes,as a person w dysthymia i found the first part where the author describes the conflicting desires to both die and meet your physical needs really interesting and validating
yes,"I'm laying in bed at home with the lights off, door locked, and I don't feel safe. I feel like I could get shot at any moment. I hate this."
yes,I just don't know where to go from here. I don't know what is 'normal' since I've pretty much been this way for as long as I can remember. I don't know if I had 'better days' because I seem to be a dark and a pessimistic person according to the people around me.
yes,After years of struggling... I've been searching about it seems it's not gonna go away.
yes,"I feel like shit because I am not a great parent, I am not working toward my goals. I try to connect with my kids but I can't deal with the noise and end up feeling guilty because I'm short and irritable with them."
yes,DH has such bad irritability towards our 17yr old son. It's like DH is LOOKING for things to get upset over that DS does. I get that the irritability can be part of his dysthymia
no,"After a really difficult school year, I’ve been having a wonderful summer. Today was especially good. Whenever I feel happy like this I’m grateful to be reminded that I’m capable of feeling this way. I’m capable of feeling good and being loved by others. You all are capable too :)"
yes,"i haven’t ever found something that explained what i was going through so well. mdd just didn’t perfectly fit what i was going through. so i stopped going to therapy and continued taking medication for mdd. now, almost a year later i’m reading about dysthymia. i’m not diagnosed with it but i feel strongly that i have it."
yes,"I have been diagnosed for dysthymia several years ago, and have been struggling with deep depression in waves for over a decade."
yes,"I have this lowkey background sadness and chronic suicidal thoughts for years now. And a general feeling of tiredness from life, from work, from people I am forced to deal with, from people who make me happy but are temporary in my life, from finding things to be excited about life, only to become disillusioned."
yes,Anyone with chronic depression been on it and did it help? How was the side effect profile?
yes,i feel like a failure. and i'm so tired. i wish i could just take a break 
no,"Yes but that’s hardly a dose, hope you plan to increase"
yes,I started on 2.5 mg for a month before I went up to 5. I did notice *some* benefits but I definitely notice these benefits amplified with a higher dose. My dr reminds me that it’s like a supplement for my brain… so don’t overthink it!
yes,"I felt like I was on serious MDMA 24/7 and it was incredible... I still have my days for sure, but feel like they’re less. I also have GAD"
yes,I'm feeling a little worse
yes,"I could actually feel it when normally I would be triggered in a situation, but something (the drug) was stopping me from feeling too intensely. So sensitivity went way down. I still get anxious from time to time out of nowhere."
yes,I felt a major improvement. I felt that I had a lot more energy and will to do things. However even that stopped working as well recently.
yes,"Yeah, I have to go slow so I don't feel the side effects, otherwise I will quit taking it. Have done that too many times and probably have wasted a lot of time."
yes,I feel worse the last 2 days and it is scaring me
yes,I'm hoping the combo will help to normalize my intense feelings.
yes,"I feel very sad still, although I am very high functioning.  More of my life is behind me now, not in front of me."
yes,I actually feel worse the last 2 days. It's scaring me.
yes,I'm scared for my well being right now. I went to therapy last week and it didn't really do much except throw money down the toilet. Sometimes I just want to throw up my arms and give up.
no,"Hey there Tequilla9988 - thanks for saying thanks! TheGratitudeBot has been reading millions of comments in the past few weeks, and you’ve just made the list!"
no,"If you don't feel you need it, you really might not. I think 2.5 is okay but I'm not a professional so who knows. And you can always take a higher OR lower dose as you and your doctor see fit depending on symptoms.
I'm happy to see you're taking care of yourself. And I also want to remind you that the bulk of my work was still 'therapeutic' in style. For me it was self-therapy, for others it can be actual therapy...whatever works for you. The drugs are one side of the coin (and still incredibly helpful).
✌️"
yes,"The thing with dysthymia is that it starts to feel normal, especially because we're high functioning, so you think the sadness and the low energy is just who you are. When the veil is lifted though (and it lifts slowly) you will look back and compare what you used to be like, almost in disbelief."
no,"I agree with CandyJars. Personally, I'd give it about two weeks, that's the amount of time I gave it before feeling that it was not enough. Also about that thirsty feeling, that's a very likely side effect of it as it can make your mouth feel dry. I would write down any side effects that you feel so when you talk with your doctor you have it all on record."
yes,I feel that my main goal right now is to try and get the right medication to help with my depression.
yes,"I think you made a valid point about getting the depression and medication under control first before doing any therapy. Sometimes it helps me, sometimes it doesn't."
no,How are you doing now?
no,Hello!  I switched to generic Wellbutrin.........a few days ago.  We will see how it goes.........how are you doing?
yes,never had success with medications in the past
no,"Hi all, is there anyone who went back to SSRI after microdosing LSD or psilocybin for a while? Is there anything to be considered or can I start right away with SSRIs? Is the effect of the SSRI (in my case Escitalopram) the same as before Microdosing or is anything different after reuptake? Thanks!"
yes,"Every day is a trudge through waist-high quicksand. I can never take a deep enough breath. No meds take the anxiety away besides those with abuse potential, which i wont be prescribed. My mood is an average of 4 with a handful of normal person days a year. majority of the time im just functional enough to get up and moving. most the time i dont bother to go shopping for food until i get too hungry. ... i feel misunderstood. i cant imagine where id be without this weight on my back all these years. i get no sympathy from family, its taxing on them too, so i dont complain to them anymore. ... i get anxiety attacks in the morning n middle of the night. my hands n feet tingle. cant sleep tonight. ... i never want to change or try new meds again. withdrawals are hell for me. i want to be gone. the suicide hotline is...a good last resort...annoying before that point. the hospital is a hellish experience, never going back. so much disdain for life, the urge to cut is high."
yes,"I think I live in basically a violent cycle of feeling like I’m not doing good enough and wanting to do more... But that thrill quickly fades away as what I do becomes more exhausting and I suddenly feel like everything is pointless and it doesn’t matter how much effort I put in, so I end up going right back to bed rotting and escapist behaviors. This bed rotting then leads to massive guilt and anger at myself for not doing better, wondering what’s wrong with me, why I can’t be like everyone else... I almost feel like I wasn’t meant to actually engage with being human, but I was rather meant to just observe humanity. I feel disconnected from a lot of big life experiences..."
yes,Medication hasn’t worked yet... 2nd appointment in therapy and the therapist realizes I don’t have trauma or much to talk about...
yes,"I feel like an empty shell of a person, like I’m physically here but not fully present in this world, like I’m playing a character in a movie or video game. I have hobbies and interests, family and friends, but I don’t have a solid “identity.”"
yes,"I am 27F, diagnosed last week, i like reading and dancing, i am from raipur, chhattisgarh, India, i don't want to share my original name but you guys can address me as Neha."
yes,"I would like to hear your account. How they effect you, how they inter relate?... trauma, post trauma, and a horrible cancerous depression called dysthymia"
yes,Often think I m more aware of how things really are and tend to judge people as plain
yes,"I’m at the lowest feeling point in my life...I’m in a supremely fragile state...I normally never feel like this, and it’s MAJORLY exhausting my body in a truly unbearable way..."
yes,"Sometimes I felt insufficient for having dysthymia - as in: well, it ain't that bad if it's not major depression. You can still get out of bed. So: get yourself together and so on. Having a depression that is not healed somehow fits better into how I feel & it makes it more serious in a way."
yes,"I try to keep the momentum going, but now it's like I've gone from freeway driving to pushing a car in neutral on a flat road. I know the hill is coming."
yes,"I sometimes think that my maybe my dysthymia isn’t real because I feel “normal” usually for part of a day to maybe a couple days, then I go back to feeling down afterwards. I feel like life is so unreal, like it’s so surreal for some reason. I’ll just be walking around school and I can barely feel my body, but at the same time I’m still there."
yes,Every morning...extreme boredom...I have insomnia.
no,Bipolar post in Dysthymia subreddit?
no,We are not bipolar in here
no,Wrong sub
yes,"I've had low energy most of the time and frequent bouts of mildly debilitating depression. I'm usually anti-social, have mild anxiety around conversations, and insomnia. I've tried various sleep hygiene measures, melatonin, and benadryl. I've also tried antidepressants like lexapro and prozac."
yes,I'm on the road to recovery from a pretty bad episode myself.
yes,it is the only therapy that ever really helped me at all.
yes,I feel like my old self and my suicidal ideations are back.
yes,"I've felt border line crazy because how I would feel most days and people wouldn’t understand no matter how I’ve tried to explain it. I am in a place where the slightest hiccup gets me down and I tend to stay down, for a long time. I’ve hated the fact that I am this way with until recently, no explanation. I wonder if other’s have felt this way. When something happens, that may not be as detrimental to someone else, Its more so “life” happening to you, you just fall into a downward spiral? Like, you don’t want to be there, you try to talk yourself out of it but it doesn’t work. You have moments where you can put of a face as its needed, but inside you feel like you’re being a fraud? Its not how you truly feel. Some days you want to cry, you feel the emotion to do so, you never shed a tear. Many times, I’ve wanted to just cry because I could find the words to express my feelings and I just sit there with this overwhelming sadness."
yes,"I often wonder if others feeling the same way as me, but are just not as 'weak' as me and don't show it and manage to keep their lives together? This brings an extreme guilt/shame feeling."
yes,I can't seem to shake the feeling like I'm either going to blow this whole thing OR I just am too terrible to have good things happen.
yes,"I feel like even if my mood starts to improve I am quickly brought back down again by thoughts about how pointless existence is, how myself and everyone I know will be dead in 100 years, how at some point the sun is going to die and there will be no traces of the Earth left, etc."
yes,"I'm currently in a double depression phase, which is nothing new to me, but I recognize how it's exhausting me more than normally. I can't just rely on it stopping anymore, because I know that it just will happen again. And again. And again. Up until the point I cease to exist, I will have to make a conscious effort to do even the simplest things like brushing my teeth, showering, cooking or working. I can't concentrate, I can't find a partner, I sometimes can't even get out of bed. And this will stay with me forever."
yes,I lack interest in other people and find computers and objects to be more engaging.
yes,My self esteem usually is pretty low. I'm pretty self critical. I overanalyze things and feel guilty maybe too much. I feel hopeless and I feel like I shouldn't try because I know I will fail.
yes,"I’m too tired. I know exercising might get rid of the exhaustion but guess what, I AM TOO TIRED TO GET UP. I hope everyone exercises. Because that to me seems like something you do when you are less or not depressed anymore. I fucking hate living and I’m making excuses to not kill myself."
yes,"I'll listen to someone about their problems, but not really care or just want them to go away; Offer help to others while secretly hoping they don't need it; act friendly and warm when I actually feel pretty down or upset; hold back opinions and criticism, even if it's warranted, to spare someone's feelings so they don't turn on me."
yes,"constantly doubting everything that I feel, I never manage to feel satisfied, everything feels meaningless because it has no impact, what I do is pointless"
yes,"I was a frightened kid who didn't care much for the outside... My teens: at fourteen the whole dysthymic box popped wide open in response to alienation by my entire, compact circle of friends... I was troubled with all of what you might expect: estrangement from women, intense self-doubt, fear of my father, fear of failure, suicidal ideation, bad sleep, hopelessness... During all of which I'd use computers as a shutdown mechanism, compulsively walking up the stairs to my floor of the house to abuse screen time... I dissociated and broke my femur at work... I suffered a breakup which reinstated my depression... I do assess that I've not one, but two chronic illnesses to figure... excessive digital stimulation and chronic depression are without a doubt the two arbiters of my neurology, thought pattern, culture and motivations."
yes,"Feeling dark, cold, and alone... I'm just dark, cold, and alone. I don't get it. ...my brain is tired... I just stare - and I can do that for hours. Not moving cuz I don't want to, not listening but hearing typical noise, no TV cuz I'm sick of it, not reading cuz I don't feel like it - just breathing. It's blankness."
yes,I've had a few medications since then and dose adjustments. As of late I've noticed my memory isn't the same. I can't remember things I should. Everything is more foggy. I'm more numb to everything also (that might be a depression flare up though).
yes,I dont believe I have any self worth... my self worth hasnt really changed over time just buried it deep down
yes,"felt incredibly uncomfortable... 'what am I doing here?', 'I shouldn't be here', 'I don't deserve to be here'... I was terribly quiet and awkward around my co-workers... I was just being a shitty version of me."
yes,"I'm 33 and going through a divorce and it has sent me through a rollercoaster of emotions, and I'm pretty stable, but stable for me is 'not quite suicidal but not happy.' I've struggled with dysthymia my whole life... I feel like consciously it should be easy, she is gay I'm a man it never wad going to work. But I had such a hard time developing relationships because of my state of mind... I have dated a bit since she left, and it's all been kinda ok. I fucked up pretty much all the relationships though because I just can't enjoy them for what they were. I keep isolating myself and getting bummed when the other person doesn't come after me."
yes,Everyday I think 'this is the worst I've ever felt' and it feels like that everyday with no progress.
yes,I can't keep lasting relationships due to boredom. My apathy for things and people make it hard for me to have deep long lasting relationships. I get disinterested in people and move onto the next like I do with everything else in my life.
yes,"After years of feeling terrible about myself, and life ever so slowly slipping away from my control, I've hit my lowest point. I got diagnosed with dysthymia"
yes,"every year seems to get harder, every step forward seems to give me 2 steps backwards"
yes,Sometimes I can't tell what's part of dysthymia vs what is part of limiting beliefs vs what I should realistically expect for myself. I go between idealism and realism.
yes,"I suspect my dysthymia has become rather severe as of late. I nearly dropped all my hobbies again, been struggling to get out of bed or just move around in general. Had a fight with the SO because I spent two hours unable to pick what to watch or do two weeks ago, and they've mentioned that my indecisiveness is only getting worse as the days go by."
yes,"I haven't ever been truly happy in life. Ever. Chronic loneliness and stuff. I have had a couple depressive episodes where i've actually felt like shit 24/7. Other than that im in a neutral mood but not happy. Im suicidal because im tired of not having a good, or at least tolerable, life, not because of actual emotional pain."
yes,"Misfit unknown even within myself, Burden for all, ever since I was born, Suffocating life, not I asked for, Judgmental words, pointing fingers"
yes,I've gained 35 pounds because I began using food as a means of coping with my mental illness. ... I have to figure out a way to STOP using food. ... I became addicted to Percocet ... So food was what remained.
yes,can't take wellbutrin as is turns me into a crazy person
yes,going through withdrawal because no more/unreliable transportation
yes,"During that time I had episodes of anxiety and was not able to properly function, during one of them I experienced what I can describe as losing my emotions. It first felt like a tingle in my neck and got worse till the point I am today which is 5 months later. I barely have the motivation to get out of bed, everything seems flat, there is no connection between my conversations and my inner feeling, my mind is pretty much blank most of the time, there is no daydreaming or filter really between me and the outside world."
yes,"I feel like I'm always chasing after my energy, living in this capitalist hellhole as a disabled person takes 10 times the energy I have... I have chronic, episodic and winter depression... I can make do, if I can just improve a little. If I can just eat a little healthier, be a little tidier, know how to manage my energy a little better."
yes,"I have a huge problem making commitments because I'm always thinking that I will let people down and I'm soo afraid that they think I'm not smart, that I just freeze and all I can think about is quit and hide. I just had this meeting about not doing a good job in my last task, and English is not my first language, so I was so anxious that I could barely speak and now I just want to quit it."
yes,I constantly feel down. Every day. Even on really good days i have this small but noticeable low feeling. I also have a feeling of just wanting to die because of all the shit that's going on in the world
yes,"With dysthymia, for me, it felt like I was always either sad or completely apathetic. And almost everyday I would just lay in bed and read sad quotes, stories, or other thing to validate these negative feelings. Something to realize is depression can be addicting. It somehow felt good, even if wasn’t happiness, to just dwell on negative emotions and think about how terrible the world is and how shitty of a person I was and that always led to feelings of hopelessness and suicide."
yes,I feel really irritable and just having a rough day and the dumbest little thing will set me off. I ended up screaming and throwing the container of laundry detergent. Other times it’s been more serious where I’m having an ongoing fit that might be better described as a breakdown.
yes,"The more I am distracted by my life, the less depressive symptoms I feel but it feels like a rat race and as soon as one distraction is gone the bad feelings return and when a distraction loses its new excitement, I have to find something new. I'm a deeply sad and scared person."
yes,I’m a 19 year old female with anergic dysmythia; so with the anhedonia. I was diagnosed when I was around 14 years old.
yes,"I don't wanna be with anybody, I'm so tired, I just wanna drink my beers alone and having a big sleep. Dunno who to talk, everything sucks and I can do nothing about it."
yes,I feel like a waste of space and am just constantly in a daze. All I want to do is sleep or just mindlessly watch comedic sitcoms just to feel something. I dont know how to feel about any of this anymore. There are times where its all too much and i feel like i cant breathe.
yes,"I guess for some that's a good thing since it means that you can create this meaning. For me it's this lack of certainty that makes me feel like I can just do whatever I want but at the same time not make me want to choose anything, since anything I do will eventually mean nothing when I cease to exist."
yes,the suffering will end
yes,I've been on 40mg Viibryd now for about 6 months. The Viibryd has definitely helped me a lot by cutting back on my low lows. My baseline is of course still lower than others and I'm not happy per se..
yes,"I literally have no purpose for living. I know roughly where I'll do it, how I'll do it and what time I'll do it, I just haven't set a date."
no,"I recently found out about this frankly revolutionary treatment and it almost seems to good to be true. Have any of you tried it? If so, what were your experiences?"
yes,I can usually tell in the first few days or a week if a med is going to work or agree with me.
yes,I’m horribly depressed and anxious. I haven’t been eating and drinking fluids regularly. I also haven’t showered in 3-4 days. I feel so tired and unwell that I’m struggling with just getting off my couch. I’m crying because its so hard. I don’t want to do anything anymore.
yes,"My mother, in fact to a degree both parents, verbally and emotionally abused me a lot, resulting in a fair amount of self-loathing and lack of self-confidence from a very early age."
yes,"I knew he was depressed before we got together, but didn't really know the specifics. Today he told me he was diagnosed with dysthymia"
yes,"I just don't have the energy to put into anything anymore. All I seem to be able to do is go to work, then come home and watch some stuff on YouTube until it's time for bed. It's effecting my 8yr old son as well, as he and I used to bond over gaming and I just can't do it anymore, and it's hard to explain to him why."
yes,I was out on a restrictive diet and had to take 50 horse pill sized nutritional supplements a day. The psychiatrists who treated me only ever put me on one antidepressant. They were probably more concerned that I seemed a volatilely angry young man so they put me on antipsychotics that had me sleeping 12 hours a day.
yes,"I believed that something was wrong with me due to my bad memory, confusion, little to none attention span... I have to admit that this was not totally unexpected because i did make my own small research and came to an understanding that depression can have similar symptoms to ADHD. This condition of mine, as i can remember, has been persistent for over a decade now."
yes,I haven’t had the energy to wash or care for myself. I didn’t realize my okay was truly so low in comparison to what normal happy is.
yes,"I can't bear to listen to people talk about themselves. They go on and on and on about shit I just don't care about. I just want to be in my bubble... I find myself getting really irritated when people take too long to get to the point, or when they start talking about things I don't find interesting and they won't stop."
yes,"PDD/Any other mental issues play a big part on how we interact with people, so I feel like it's important to let those who want to be involved with us on a deeper level know before something happens. Because it will eventually affect them in some way."
yes,my symptoms were causing a problem
no,Thanks!
no,Thanks!
no,">Thanks!
You're welcome!"
yes,"I just… i have suicidal thoughts almost every day, I think of killing myself when my mind wanders around, when I am stressed, when I get sadder than my normal level, when anything happens.. I have suicidal thoughts on loop, such as “i want to kill myself i want to kill myself i wanna kill myself…” I dont value myself enough, I always think of the worst, and I keep wanting to kill myself. I can’t do that, because I live with family. When words aren’t enough, i have imagery of suicide, such as a bullet going through my head and brain juice splattering onto the sky. Any time, any day.. I never have the sort of energetic mood everyone else is supposed to have. I can act normally and I guess I can have the sort of happy persona around my friends, but I guess my energy level is always two steps below a normal person. And i just want to stop being alive… i don’t know if my family is my trigger or not, but pls i just want to escape.. i dont want to feel like this, maybe this is not normal at all…"
yes,its hard for me to do anything other than lay in bed and either cry or think about how meaningless everything seems to be.
yes,"I have some kind of obsession to have an identity and many times i fantasize myself different, more pretty, more social, more feminine, less miserable and less empty. ... I feel like emptines is my real self. ... I don't know if i can feel connected to other people or feel good when they are kind to me because i know they will not be there forever. ... Its a trigger for me to hear people have it worse than me or that other people have real problems because i feel like i am not deserve the attention for my situation."
yes,"I remember hating myself and thinking I was going to be homeless because I did bad in school, then developed social anxiety and had no friends for all of middle school and HS."
yes,"I still struggle, almost daily with just WANTING to do things. As in, I want to want to wake up early and eat breakfast. I want to want to get organized. Except everything feels like a chore, even when my mood is good, and I am not stressed at work. Waking up 5 minutes extra in the morning to eat feels impossible. Cooking lunch to bring to work feels impossible."
yes,I seem to encounter a lot of those type of paradoxes in my life. Somehow even the solution becomes a problem.
yes,"I felt like a burden, but then things got so bad I felt I had no other choice but to ask, almost beg, for help - for some comfort, an escape, a safe space, etc. ... I feel so alone."
yes,"I'm not passionate about anything anymore. You used to write and reach out to people. Now you isolate, watch TV, or play video games. You used to exercise too. Now you just stand there or lay there, waiting to fall asleep so you can do the exact same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and probably every day until you die. You have it better than plenty of people but you still act like you have this awful life."
yes,"I couldn't have imagined this state until it started, it is hell at times. I'm stuck in a cycle of instant alleviation only to make both worse long term... I'm prolonging my recovery from depersonalization/derealization with alcohol... I'm probably in early stages of alcoholism... Feeling very mild - mild withdrawal symptoms. Significantly worse anhedonia and anxiety, very slight shaky feelings at times. I'm very reluctant to medication because I've heard so many stories of them inducing anhedonia and depersonalization/derealization long term. Neither of these conditions have a direct counter to them as well, once you have them. So I just feel like I'm stuck."
yes,"After a very traumatic death in my family, I started getting lots of anxiety episodes and being generally sad. My doctor sent me to a psychiatrist and put me on antidepressants. After two years I got diagnosed with dysthymia (or persistent depressive disorder)."
yes,"i really hope it helps, ive been trying to get some sort of medication for a while."
yes,"I experience constant derealization and derealization to some degree for a long time, but I don't know how long exactly. I have been dysthymic since I was 16, but was only diagnosed three years ago."
yes,My social anxiety got worse and I started spending more and more time alone. I was definitely depressed but I never felt it was bad enough. I felt down all the time but it wasn't bad enough to count as depression. I've had episodes like that and my PHQ-9 results have gone over 20 occasionally.
yes,"The deep and debilitating exhaustion, the brain fog, the lack of motivation, lack of feeling or emotion, and that deep body depression that I can feel down to my bones that no anti-depressant has ever been able to heal finally finally finally has an answer."
yes,"He is irritable, snarky, wallowing, apathetic, wanders around in a fog. He is barely working part time at his job. Misses all deadlines. He says this is as good as it gets.... He doesn't know how to be happy and kinda likes being sad."
yes,I did also had an episode where I wanted to just end it all. I cannot accept that I have dysthymia and I am trying to deny it because I cannot believe that I have to live like this until I die.
yes,I've been having some issues with being able to stay asleep... The sleep deprivation symptoms are starting to counteract some of the benefits I'm getting
yes,"I've been depressed since I was a kid, faked happiness, and was called an attention seeker when I opened up. I've seen many doctors, been to the psych ward, and felt horrible. I'm all alone, no one wants to listen to me, and I don't remember the last time I felt genuine happiness. Some days I just wanna cry but feel dead and numb inside."
yes,"I wouldn't consider myself a normal, functioning human.. but I at least have a raft when I was barely holding my head above water before."
yes,"I have already started treatment and I can observe improvements, that is, for the first time in my life I could experience waking up in a good mood, it's happened twice so far. The treatment gives me a lot of hope that one day I can have a normal life but i have a doubt that does not leave my head. So far I've been able to experience an improvement thanks to the remedies however despite my psychiatrist saying that it is possible to improve and not need medicine anymore i don't see many stories on the internet of people who have problems with dysthymia that have be cured."
yes,I struggle with lack of motivation. I get overwhelmed by things I need to get done in the day... I can't force myself to actually do the thing... I just want to sleep.
yes,"It is roughly the tenth job I have had in my life. Like all the other jobs I have had it is meaningless to me, low-paid, and unfulfilling. Of all the aspects of how my depression manifests itself my employment situation is the most distressing to me because it is such a perfect metaphor for the depression."
yes,"I live in stress and pain because it's the only thing that feels real, grounded. I struggle accept what I am and what I've done to my life to be able to turn it around. I wish someone could just surprise me with a bullet in my head because I'm too afraid to do it myself."
yes,"I feel like this since i was a child and now it's more obvious. I don't have my own perspective, i don't have my own personality. I'm just empty inside with no story, no perspective of my own, nothing that belongs to me,  just emptiness. Always confused of what is real or fake inside me. But now i don't want to live life because i'm too scared and too tired for it. And i think lately that i don't want to exist and fantasize my own death makes me more comfortable."
yes,"I was cognitively dying. And hardly learning or studying. I was losing my self. I am disappointed in myself. And very hurt at the time and money wasted. Dropping out isn't a magic solution, I'm still very much depressed and I have periods of feeling like i am a burden and that I deserve nothing/have no self worth. I'm still avoiding people because I feel ashamed for not being able to support uni life."
yes,"After years and years of self-education, google surfing, etc., I've finally started up counseling. I can safely say that I'm in the same boat as many others - general listlessness, a feeling of hopelessness and that nothing will ever change or be good, and years and years of never having really been happy. I can sort of vaguely function at work. "
yes,I’m thinking about checking myself into the hospital just so I can speak to a psychiatrist ASAP.. I honestly don’t know what else to do at this point.
yes,"So, I was just diagnosed today with Dysthymia. I understand that exercise and therapy play a large role in managing it, but I was told that I will also have to take medication."
yes,I'm 99% sure I have dysthymia... I feel like if I don't get a diagnosis then I wasted both of their time.
yes,"I've had dysthymia for about 10 years. The frustrating thing for me has been thinking that I can control it. When I’m at work or traveling, I almost feel normal. Pretty sure it’s worse at home because of the stress of life, obligations, kids, cooking etc."
yes,"can't really bring myself to do much. The last time I had an episode this bad was a few years ago when I went suicidal for about two years and was then diagnosed. All I've really been doing for the past few days is lying in bed, crying, or watching TV. I've tried getting up to work on projects or exercise a bit, but it's just really physically and mentally exhausting, can't really last for more than 20 minutes."
yes,"My moods seem to change like the weather. I may be feeling OK or just kind of flat in the morning, then sometime during the day I just feel the dark clouds rolling in and I’m really down for however long it lasts. Or maybe I go to bed feeling neutral, then wake up to the dark cloud feeling."
yes,"I tend to feel really empty, or kinda sad actually.. but also very empty and lonely. I try to distract myself but nothing seems fun... I continue this cycle daily and have been consuming a lot more alcohol these days to feel better."
yes,I've read so many stories of people being unable to recover from whatever symptoms their medication brought up or permanently made worse.
yes,I've been feeling stressed and on the brink of a burn out...I've also got dysthymia and a distinct fear of rejection...I feel so extremely worthless and stuck...my mental health is plummeting and there is just no place for me to go and I don't know what the point is anymore.
