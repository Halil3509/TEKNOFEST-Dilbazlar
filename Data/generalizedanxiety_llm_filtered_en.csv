yes,We go to protest which make me nervous so to keep me calm I say things that are familiar or talk about things that are simple and calming to keep me grounded and so I don’t feel like a balloon floating by everyone else. But instead of asking me why I do that she goes “you don’t seem like you want to be there like your head isn’t in the right spot. Would you even go if I wasn’t around? Would you go out of your way?” YES I WOULD IF YOU HAD BOTHERED TO ASK INSTEAD OF COMING AT ME LIKE IF YOU KNOW ME BETTER THEN I KNOW ME AND WHAT I GO THROUGH. As you can tell I absolutely HATE it when people assume but HATE it more when people got attitude behind it. Am I overreacting?
no,"I was on Trintellix for a year and had a good experience.  I use as many natural tools as I can (meditation, therapy, yoga) and have xanax for those times when I need something quicker.  I've had good luck with this method--been diagnosed for 15 years with GAD--but there was a time when I just needed relief from the constant worry.  Thought if I could have a 3-6 month reprieve, I would renew my energies, so I went on Trintellix and it did just what I needed.  The edge was gone on a daily basis and it was the break I needed.  However, I did become complacent after the few months rest.  I lost ""spark"" and motivation.  I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  Like I said, I needed the spikes of anxiety to mellow and plateau for a while, but after 6-8 months, I was ready to go back to use the tools that allowed me to be creative and involved instead of being so mellow...so I went off of it around 12 months.  I had no negative side effects.  I was worried about nausea and dizziness the first two weeks but never had it.  I didn't gain weight except for maybe sitting around more than I should have.  Something to talk to your doctor about: I did have a MAPP Report done to test my genetic impact on 17 different anti-anxiety/depression drugs.  It was just a cheek swab sent to the lab and they were able to tell me which drugs I would genetically act well with, and which I wouldn't.  It was helpful because the first two drugs my doctor would have put me on (Lexipro and Zoloft) were on my not good list so we avoided that trial and error.  Good luck.  Hang in there!"
yes,I have been on escitalopram (generic Lexapro) for 2 years for anxiety. It helps to balance my mood more generally and I don’t cry/get worked as much as I used to. My family actually saw a noticeable difference as well. I did have some small side effects at first. Mostly tiredness but that largely went away after the first month or so. I would definitely say it’s worth trying. You could always stop taking it if it doesn’t work for you
yes,"I’ve been on my medication for two years. Trazadone to help me sleep, as it is a nonaddictive sedative. Citalopram to help me dismiss my anxious thoughts, it’s an SSRI. They both also function as an antidepressant. Although I don’t struggle with depression I do have GAD as well, which I feel can be a downer."
no,"Took SSRIs 5 years ago, for 8 months.
Didn’t see any difference in terms of helping with anxiety. The side effects were really bad... nausea, migraines, dizziness... I hear they work wonders for some people, though. And they are quite safe to take if they work for you, and of course with regulated timeframe and dosage."
yes,"I’m almost certain it’s because of my GAD, but it’s incredibly frustrating. Both short term and some long term. Or my husband will ask me a question like “where is item X” and I’ll forget the word I’m trying to think of.."
yes,I feel like I had GAD for years before I realised irritability/anger can be a sign of anxiety.
yes,"Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting."
yes,Couldn’t get out of bed today so took the morning off work.. now I hate myself for staying in bed all morning. Anyone else get days like this? Where you are literally panicking at the thought of getting up?
yes,"Sometimes, after my mind makes bad case scenarios about everything, it will proceed to the pinnacle of overthinking, which is getting mad about the said scenarios. It’s a deep rage that gets to every bit of my body. I would like to know if you also have it, and if so, how you deal with it."
yes,"I recently have been having bouts of being short of breath and the frequency increased to the point that I called my doctor and they've prescribed an asthma inhaler. I went and got the inhaler, and all of the sudden, for the first night in a long time, I'm not have the breathing trouble. But I haven't used the inhaler yet!"
yes,"I just don’t understand where I’m at. I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far."
yes,"I’ve been having nonstop anxiety attacks for 3 months and have suffered from an array of physical symptoms that have never left. I’m now on one month of 20mg prozac and take xanax as needed, and have moved in with my family, which being separated from them in another country made the situation worse. I feel like now i’m in a much more stable position but I still feel like absolute shit. I get daily headaches in the back of my head and temples, my vision hurts and I can’t focus it properly, and my limbs feel extremely weak. Throughout this whole thing I also developed horrible health anxiety and i’m constantly thinking I have a serio disease such as a brain tumor or MS, or even about to have a stroke. I wanted to know if any of you have recovered from extended periods of anxiety and how long was this process, I just want to feel like myself again, everything seems so hard to do."
yes,"Yes, diazepam works great for my GAD, but I only use it in emergencies and never two days in a row. It’s very addictive and not something that one should be using several weeks in a row (can’t remover the cut off-point, but it’s only a few weeks). I take 5 mg now in emergencies for the anxiety to disappear.

I’m on Lyrica (pregabalin) for GAD, and I’ve this has been the best medication for me. I’m only on this and diazepam. No anti-depressants or other medicine with annoying side effects."
yes,"She is really struggling with her anxiety, and her depression. She rarely gets out of bed during the week, leaves the house possible once a week. Nothing seems to bring her joy or happiness right now, and I have zero idea how I can help. 

I really want to be there for her as much as possible, and I only want to help her, but I just have no idea at all how to do it. If I try to get her to talk about her feelings, or what she is feeling and thinking, she just tells me she is depressed and does not want to be awake. She is constantly anxious as well. Dealing with waves of anxiety throughout the day."
yes,"has anyone else experienced a strong urge to throw up while having anxiety/panic attacks? not in the ""i feel naseous, need to throw up"" way, but more bulimic tendencies like actually scheduling time to go to the restroom at school and making yourself throw up? 

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds. 

(i am not doing this anymore. mostly because my country is in lockdown and i'm at home with my entire family 24/7. our bathroom walls and foors are both made if milk glass and would make descreetly throwing up not very possible.) 

thankfully my anxiety levels have gone down and i'm not feeling that urge anymore, but i am concerned that it will come back if i'm in a stressful situation like that again. so i guess i'm just sharing this to ask if anyone else has had these feelings due to high anxiety. or if this could be a symptom not of my anxiety disorder, but potentially bulimia."
yes,"I just got diagnosed w GAD, although I've always suspected it but invalidated myself before. I was also prescribed Citalopram (Celexa) 10mg to start with, and I wanted to know if others had experiences with this medication or any anti-anxiety medication. I don't want to get my hopes up too high...I know it won't fix all my problems but I'm afraid I might be expecting too much in terms of relief. I don't even really know what I am expecting if i'm being honest, I guess I just want to know what to expect in case.  I keep imagining this scenario where my Co-workers/friends/family notice I've changed for the better /  enjoy my company more, but I don't know if that is realistic...so I'd rather have that dream shattered rn rather than later lol. I am not too worried about symptoms / side effects because I can always switch meds if that is the case, my psychiatrist is super sweet so I'm not intimidated to bring that up."
yes,"I function fairly normally (from the outside) but inside I am feeling really anxious all the time, startle easily and I have an inability to relax my body, amongst other things. I am skeptical towards therapy because I don't see it changing as I have had it for all my life. I would like it however to stop worrying all the time and being tense all the time."
yes,"I've been struggling with GAD, depression, selfharm and suicidal thoughts for almost all my life having had my first panic attack at 9 years old. 8 months ago I got into a long distance relationship since then my anxiety is worsining by the hour. today, something just made me really on edge and I have a routine of calling my boyfriend and talking to him for a half an hour or an hour then we dont talk till the next day. today, Ive been calling him and he doesnt respond at all i start getting really anxious and i feel like my heart is gonna stop then he answers me and I go off on him, he was sleeping and still was very sleepy when I woke him up, After hanging up, I broke down and went to my bathroom and self harmed, I still feel like absolute shit and my suicidal thoughts are constantly on my mind. getting therapy while quarantining is very expencive and medication doesnt help anymore, advice ?"
yes,"I’ve felt this for years now. I also have anxiety for other reasons, but this is awful at times. Anything that triggers the thought of throwing up - which can be a stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, or just hearing about someone who’s been sick - makes the anxiety worse. There are times when I’m perfectly OK and other times when the anxiety surrounding throwing up affects me for days or weeks until I can get my mind away from it. 

Today at work, I had a stomach ache, I kept focusing on the ache and it made it worse. My stomach felt like it was burning. My heart started racing and it made me feel like I could throw up. After a few mins, I got myself to calm down enough and the burning feeling in my stomach went away. 

It’s awful man.. anything that involves throw up or the feeling of it, I’m in straight panic mode. I can totally create the feeling in my head. One time I actually got sick in the middle of the night and to this day I think it was from making myself anxious about a feeling in my stomach..."
yes,"I've recently had a panic attack and i'm still dealing with the aftermath, up until yesterday I still had some mild chest pains and hyperventilation. I was prescribed 10mg of Prozac (i'm 4 days in now) and ever since my panic attack I've been having this really unsettling sensation in my head that often comes with dizziness. It's not pain but it feels like someone is applying pressure in my head and I can feel it around the centre of my face so behind my eyes, my cheekbones and both of my ears, and it usually only appears when i'm anxious and when i'm laying down to go to bed. I'm sure that this is just my anxiety creeping on me but it's really annoying and hard not to worry about."
yes,"Last year or so, I was referred to a psychiatrist (I think that’s the right word I’m sorry my medical lingo not great) to talk about my anxiety disorder.  My anxiety surges in amazing highs and lows, where one day I think I’m the best contender for Prime Minister, and the next I think I’ll be a crack head for the rest of my life. My therapist thinks my anxiety is chronic, and that I was probably born with it or developed it in early childhood. The psychiatrist said that while I definitely met the standards for having GAD, my level of day-to-day functioning does “not require intervention on our part.” Basically, he said I didn’t need any drugs, and that if I wanted to, I didn’t even have to keep seeing my therapist anymore. 
I don’t see my therapist anymore, and it’s been over a year since I’ve taken a psychiatric drug. My anxiety is still pretty much the same, and sometimes I really feel like I should be in therapy or medicated to help with it. But when I called back to my local mental health clinic, my anxieties described in the intake interview were “not serious enough to warrant our action.” "
yes,"Hi so im someone who has gone through a lot of anxiety and depression in my childhood... I don't know when it started just because for the longest time, I thought it was the norm. My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid."
yes,"My first attack started last thursday night while being home alone, after that I've had my mom and friends support me, drive to the hospital etc. It's been soon 60 hours since this attack started and I don't feel like it's going to go away unless I get proper medication. I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either. After 22 hours I'll be able to call into my employer and probably get someone to talk to, and hopefully a medication that would stop this particular attack. I already learned how to cope with this and what works for me and what doesn't. I'm mentally in a good state most of the time but my body won't let it go. I don't like the idea of starting a regular medication but I guess it should be a positive thing longer term. I have lots of questions, but for now I'd like to ask what is your experience with any medications and how is sleeping during an attack worked for you?"
yes,"So, I’ve unfortunately recovered a suppressed memory. I already have PTSD along with my GAD, but this one is bad. For info, I’m also BPD and agoraphobic. So I remembered a bad experience where my brother nearly strangled me to death. Anyways, it’s so vivid and his room is straight across from mine and I can see it happen in the exact spot just when I walk by it. I can’t stop thinking about it. I need 12 hours of sleep and I’m only able to get around 4 a night. It’s making me physically sick. Taking my klonopin every 8 hours like clockwork. I’ve lost 10 pounds since I remembered. I don’t know what’s going on with me and I don’t see a psychologist until Tuesday and psychiatrist on Thursday."
yes,"Lately, I’ve found myself feeling nauseous in waves; it comes and goes. My stomach doesn’t hurt but there’s a tightness that wraps around my mid section and then there’s nausea. I find if I have enough distractions or if I’m focused on something, I don’t feel the nausea as much."
yes,"Most things in life make me anxious, apprehensive, or at best worried. Reddit makes me anxious because I don't know who the hell I am dealing with. I know yeah relax baby it's just the internet. I'm good with that. I was on the internet when Bill Gates was just a lousy millionaire. But like the rest of folks who are curious about Reddit, I want to know WHO is on Reddit. Otherwise, I'm just dealing with the fragments that the Paranoid (like me) leave behind, like breadcrumbs for the birds."
yes,made me feel out of it and disphoric now I have a general feeling of unwell almost like I’m sick is that part of withdrawal?
yes,Been taking cymbalta and feel tired and lethargic and out of it has anyone else had this feeling? I felt out of it before this as well but think it’s gotten worse.
no,Where can you find those? Just heard that today 🤦🏻‍♂️
no,Nope but I've been looking to do so for awhile. I have a friend that does.
yes,I wanted to take more and more and in the end decided I had to stop all together before it got out of hand.
yes,"So if you tend to worry a lot but it doesn't hold you back in your daily life (or at least you don't perceive it that way), it's not a disorder because you're not bothered by it. But if you feel that it's holding you back in life and if you're not doing things that you would like to do because of your anxiety (*and* the other criteria apply to you as well, of course), then it's a disorder. It's likely that if you went to get help in the first place, you did so because you felt your symptoms were holding you back in some way, or were making you unhappy. People don't usually look for help when they feel they're fine (even if, to an outsider, it might seem that they're worrying overly much)."
no,"That’s incredibly unhelpful of them. Usually it becomes a disorder when you find it difficult to control the worry, or it impacts your daily life. Also, you can look up DSM diagnostic criteria for GAD. When you’re being assessed, this is basically what they ask you about except in a more simplified format. 

Here’s one link that really helped me: https://www.verywellmind.com/dsm-5-criteria-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-1393147"
yes,"I have been looking for a job for a while now, preferably an administrative assistant type job. 

I recently realized I am a raging extrovert with newfound social anxiety. 

I feel so lost and confused lately. 

And on top of that, I have had some PTSD-inducing experiences in the work place... I currently work in a restaurant as a host until I find something better but I'm regularly fighting off panic attacks trying to go into work. 

Been trying to figure out a way to work without:
1) 1099 
2) needing a specific degree
3) pays decently
4) has a regular schedule I can depend on 

I'm not opposed to working from home, but it usually conflicts with 1 and 4, sometimes 3. 

Am I nuts for trying to have it all?"
yes,"my GAD is breaking me up, can you please ahare some thoughtful usefull advices to end this misery"
no,"I’ve been on Effexor for over 10 years now. I’m currently on 225mg/day. 
I was told I had experienced some of the worse side you could get from this drug. I suffered from extreme exhaustion sleeping 14-18/hours a day, suffered migraines mainly with some headaches mixed in, excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting your name it for 6 weeks. The turn around for this drug is typically 2-4 weeks for side effects.
Keep with it and you will see major changes in the long term. This drug is what turned my life around. However I will say this drug is not for everyone. Speak with your doctor or psychiatrist if you feel you are experiencing anything that concerns you, never be afraid to ask questions and always educate yourself."
yes,"I take 150 mg daily. It jacks me up. I was told to take at bedtime to sleep, but no way. I’m wide awake about 30 minutes after I take it and I’m not a morning person."
yes,So i was recently diagnosed with GAD. i was prescribed Clonazepam (klonopin) for anxiety/panic attacks. among other things for the anxiety itself.
yes,"Over the past few months, I’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety and, while I’ve been seeing a therapist the past little while and attempting to self-medicate with CBD oil, I feel like I’m fighting a loosing battle. 

Nothing I do guarantees I won’t have an anxiety attack or get overwhelmed and shut down. I’m really only able to get myself out of those things like 20% of the time. And, even if I don’t feel nauseatingly anxious, the sense of dread and impending doom never goes away."
yes,I’m diagnosed with GAD. I took a test through an experiment my university was doing. The test results said that I have high autistic traits in a “neurotypical” population. So not actually diagnosed but I do definitely have some traits but I’m not sure if it’s more linked to my anxiety or not.
yes,"I get pain in my ribs and neck from all the tension and stuff. Distracting myself seems to help me not focus on my anxiety, but it’s still there."
yes,I am constantly on edge even when I have no apparent reason to be.
no,Ok thank you! I hope you feel better!
yes,"I (F21) have my panic attacks for 3/4 years now and I'm in therapy for it. I noticed that I got incredibly anxious after drinking coffee, Red Bull or even Cola. I know it's probably because of the increase in heartbeat etc, but I wondered who else has experience this? And what did you do about it?"
yes,"With GAD, I get overwhelming feelings of dread - a feeling like everything is about to just totally go wrong. There is no specific reason or trigger to these thoughts and I don’t have any idea of exactly what bad thing is going to happen - it’s just a general feeling of doom. 

Lately these feelings have been REALLY intense and causing panic attacks. My boyfriend always wants to talk to me about it, which I appreciate, but I’m finding it difficult for me to explain to him that I have no idea “why” I’m having a panic attack. It’s just this overwhelming feeling that comes out of nowhere. Usually our conversations go nowhere because I can’t explain it so he doesn’t know what to say to comfort me."
yes,feel like they could never give their all to a relationship because they always feel they’re on their own in life
yes,I woke up at 4 a.m. and couldn’t go back to sleep. I start having these thoughts of my family and how I’m not doing enough to make everyone happy. I start thinking of multiple things to worry about and even of the worst situations that could happen like losing someone in my family and I just start crying uncontrollably.. all that I can think to myself is how can I make this stop so I looked it up this morning and every symptom I have shows signs of generalized anxiety disorder. I don’t know what to do when I feel like this in the morning. It happens frequently. Telling myself my worries are just crazy thoughts doesn’t always help.
yes,I've been struggling in college and need three signatures to drop a class. One is from my professor and I'm finding it painstakingly hard to even get my body to move towards her office. My anxiety is through the roof! Any advice? Im nervous about the other two as well but her especially. I need to have it done by tomorrow!
yes,"For me, it's a symptom of seasonal affective disorder. Light box treatment, extra sleep and caffeine, and an exercise plan help me manage it and continue to be a student."
yes,Caffeine to beat the fatigue that anxiety causes with is exacerbated by caffeine
no,Working second shift isn’t doing me any favors I don’t believe
no,Oof I'm sorry :( that sounds rough
yes,"If someone even slightly raises their voice at me I start panicking. Doesn’t matter if it’s a total stranger or a family member - whatever, I WILL breakdown and start/be on the verge of crying, shake, hands will go numb... How do you guys handle aggressors? It’s always been a hard thing for me."
yes,"I would get super dizzy nauseous and my heart would start racing. I thought it happened because I had a high stress job but I started to feel the symptoms out of work at stores, family events, driving, being alone in public etc. I got to the point where I started to isolate myself from everything. 
       I quit my job and made my boyfriend go into stores for me and getting takeout. He came and sat in the parking lot while I was in classes. Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist and taking buspar and propranolol. I’ve been pretty good about going into stores now with my boyfriend and I can go into gas stations sometimes if I’m feeling good. I just think I’m at the point where I want to hang with my friends and they kind of understand how I’m feeling but I’m nervous to spend time with them without my boyfriend or go and do anything without him for that matter. My therapist wants me to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own but I get panic attacks. 
    I get a light headed heart racing feeling when I drive so I always worry about that happening. It’s the scariest experience. I vape which I know doesn’t help it but does anyone have any advice on how I can break out of my shell and become more social again? I get nervous getting to my destination but once I’m there I’m “ok”.  I just want to be “normal” again."
yes,"I had so many doctors swear I was just depressed and they wouldn't listen to me about the anxiety side of things. I think I experience anxiety maybe 2% of the time and that is it; almost more like my body gives out and flip over to depression. 

Got a new medication regime and I'm happy that someone finally listened to me. Now if only I could explain the ins and outs of this disorder to my family without them looking at me like I have six heads...."
yes,I’m 25 years old was told I have generalized anxiety disorder when I was 17 took medications for awhile felt better stopped going to the doctors but now lately in my life through different stresses it just feels like isn’t the same anymore everything’s a big blur full of confusion
yes,today i saw my therapist n now i finally know what’s wrong with me i have generalized anxiety disorder n she said if things keep getting worse like they have been she’s gonna talk to my mom ab taking me to a doctor to get medication n ik it’s not a good thing but it feels “better” knowing ik what’s wrong with me and it kinda gives me hope knowing there’s a way out of this
yes,it was getting “better” but it rlly hit me like a truck once i took a break from therapy i’m looking into new therapist n someone said something ab a psychologist but idk what that is but it’s getting so bad now i couldn’t sleep till 4 last night bc of how anxious i was n i just started to cry n breakdown bc this is getting rlly hard it’s been hell for me the only time i feel “normal” is when i workout since i’m xc i run a lot n that helps me sleep bc i get tired n imma join boxing and get back into basketball to keep myself occupied n i think i’m depressed n  i think i have hocd n JUST A LOT OF SHIT i’m so tired i’m so mentally and emotionally tired there’s no real happiness anymore i feel so alone too i wish i felt like myself again
yes,"I just got diagnosed with GAD after probably having it for god knows how long. I've been taking a low dose (7.5?) Buspirone twice per day and about two weeks in I felt my anxiety getting even worse. I know some depression meds will make symptoms worse before you feel the full effects so I'm wondering if this is also a thing with buspirone and anxiety? Will it get better, is it all in my head, or is this cause for alarm?"
no,"Maybe talk to your med doc, I experienced that after trying to get off Zoloft; i say call em asap"
yes,I get this occassionally. Usually it happens when I'm late on taking my medicine. If I dont take it around the same time every day I'll get dizzy and tingly.
yes,Pins and needles and face feels like it's on fire.
no,"Yooo, I’m like really late on this but I take Zolof too and to answer that question, yes.  I don’t know why or if it even is the zolof. Like a side effect maybe? Idk."
yes,"(1) If she is anxious ask her what you can do? Depending on where she is in the anxious moment she may say “Nothing” or “I don’t know” but the offer matters. 

(2) Ask her “Does everything feel not quite real?” If she says “Yes” then she is depersonalizing. This, essentially, means that her anxiety is overwhelming every sense and she feels like she is not quite a part of her surroundings. Ask her to stand up. Tell her to trust you. And then give her a big bear hug and to hold on as long as she can. The tightness will help push her sense of touch into the forefront, above the anxiety, and bring her “back” after a minute or two. If a hug is too intense and makes her feel entrapped, a firm hand hold can help too. 

(3) If she snaps at you at all, try not to react. When anxiety is pushes all of her buttons she is trapped between her fight or flight response since she can’t run away from her own brain. So fight tends to be externalized. She’ll apologize when she pushes beyond the anxiety. Tell her you’ll be in that bathroom or the bedroom or wherever is nearby but takes you out of the line of fire while she gets to the next level."
yes,"having gad it sometimes feels impossible to try to explain how my anxiety affects me to my bf, even sent this to mine as advice. also having conversations about what she may feel like when she’s not stressed can help you better understand what she’s going through/how to react"
no,https://www.disclose.tv/scientists-now-say-the-universe-itself-is-conscious-347343
no,So becoming one with yourself is almost like becoming one with the universe 🤔🙌
yes,"I have had this constant on and off uneasy-ness and butterflies in my stomach whenever I think of a situation that may cause anxiety. I think it's come to the point where I am now checking if it's there when I haven't focused on it for a while, which causes the cycle to continue. This has never happened to me before?"
yes,"Some days it's so hard to even keep a convo going, I usually try to cut it short.  I feel bad but I hate having to pretend that I am not falling apart inside. I wish I could be normal."
yes,"Im 25 right now and I am feeling very low, anxious,DP/DR, dissociation, for the past 8 months.I have had 7-8 panic attacks in the past 10 yrs.Are they anxiety related or are they just panic disorder? Recently I heard that GAD doesn't have panic attacks,is it true? Or is it just a myth? I read in a article that GAD and Panic disorder are separate entities.Please share your views"
yes,"Currently experiencing a panic attack with derealization.I have had like 7-8 panic attacks since 10 years and I'm 25 now.Feelings of low self-esteem, depression,memory issues and intrusive thoughts engulfed my whole 10 yrs of life.I feel like giving up on life every day.Im a diagnosed GAD(of course on online by a therapist).Will it ever get better? I am having DP/DR for the past 7 months and I'm numb emotionally,Will this depersonalization stay lifelong with me?Can i ever feel like the way I felt in my childhood or it's a life long curse for me?"
yes,"Friend of mine (F/20) is constantly worrying (sometimes to the point of feeling physically sick) about everything in her life that could go wrong but will never really happen if you think about it, e.g. she worries she'll get breast cancer, that she won't get married, that she won't pass law exams that she cannot do until we finish our undergrad degree (at least two and a half years away) and these are exams that she doesn't even think she will do because she doesn't actually want to be a lawyer. She constantly puts herself down and says she's not good at things that from an outside perspective (other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this) seems like she's just looking for validation because it's obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she won't do anything about it. I've asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor (she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldn't do this but I do think she suffers from it) I've told her I'm worried about her, I've told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like I'm talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and I'm getting to the stage where I've stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because she's just not listening. I'm beginning to feel annoyed every time she puts herself down and I'm really trying not to but it's really hard to keep propping someone else's self-esteem up. Don't get me wrong I love this girl, she's practically my best friend but recently the relationship has been exhausting and I don't know how I can get through to her. Any advice would be welcome."
yes,I'm controlling about 50% of my GAD with Gabapentin and Lorazepam. Not ideal but enables me to function
no,I've been on celexa for about 10 yrs same dosage (10mg). And it stopped working for me. My doctor adjusted my dosage to 20 mg and I became over stimulated. Literally felt manic. He adjusted it again to 15mg and it worked. Is it worth going back to your original and maybe also adjusting?? 
yes,"For me, not having anything to focus on makes my brain wander even more, giving me more to worry about."
no,Have you tried cognitive behavioural therapy?
yes,Like the worst environment for my anxiety is to sit in a room alone with my thoughts.
yes,That’s why I’m almost always scrolling through things on my phone when I’m trying to unwind. It’s better to have something unimportant for my mind to focus on.
yes,"I am intensely worried and have convinced myself that I have schitzophrenia. I had derealization 24/7 for 9-10 months but have snapped out of it, still get feelings of unreality on some days but it's not where near as bad. My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind. The biggest problem is that whenever I see something, I.e a person in a suit with a suitcase, if it resembles what you'd see in a movie, the person looking like an agent, I start to ecesssively think about why I though that and end up worrying about it all day. But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality. I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help. I am going to see a phsyc again and am not looking for reassurance but am really scared so if anyone can help at all. Is paranoia like this common with depersonalization?"
