It might even help reduce your anxiety during the protests if you know that your girlfriend understands what you're struggling with and can support you if it gets too hard. 

And remember if your anxiety is too bad to attend a protest it doesn't mean you don't care. Some days are easier than others. It can be unsafe to attend a protest when your mind is in an anxiety fog and cannot think clearly. Stay safe and good luck",4,1603951546.0

I use as many natural tools as I can (meditation, therapy, yoga) and have xanax for those times when I need something quicker.  I've had good luck with this method--been diagnosed for 15 years with GAD--but there was a time when I just needed relief from the constant worry.  Thought if I could have a 3-6 month reprieve, I would renew my energies, so I went on Trintellix and it did just what I needed.  The edge was gone on a daily basis and it was the break I needed.  However, I did become complacent after the few months rest.  I lost ""spark"" and motivation.  I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  Like I said, I needed the spikes of anxiety to mellow and plateau for a while, but after 6-8 months, I was ready to go back to use the tools that allowed me to be creative and involved instead of being so mellow...so I went off of it around 12 months.  I had no negative side effects.  I was worried about nausea and dizziness the first two weeks but never had it.  I didn't gain weight except for maybe sitting around more than I should have.  Something to talk to your doctor about: I did have a MAPP Report done to test my genetic impact on 17 different anti-anxiety/depression drugs.  It was just a cheek swab sent to the lab and they were able to tell me which drugs I would genetically act well with, and which I wouldn't.  It was helpful because the first two drugs my doctor would have put me on (Lexipro and Zoloft) were on my not good list so we avoided that trial and error.  Good luck.

I tried to go up to 20 once but I didn't like it. 

I noticed a huge difference right away and so did my partner. I didn't tell him I was taking anything and about a month or two in i asked him if he noticed anything different about me and he had noticed a significant increase in happiness and significant decrease in panic attacks and being generally depressed. 

There was nausea the first couple days my body was getting used to it and if i forget to take it for 2-3 days i experience lightheadedness, dizziness, mild nausea, and depending on how emotionally stable I am at the time there is a high likelihood of me having a ""im super sad and wanna lay in bed all day"" day and/or have a meltdown. 

It has definitely changed my sex drive and I think it's contributing to my weight gain. Not gonna lie the change in my sex drive has been really hard to get used to. It didn't change right away though. It was a very slow decline until all or a sudden I realized I hadn't had the desire to have sex in over a month. 

Overall I'm doing much better and I think the drawbacks are worth it. At least for now. I would take being chubby and sexually confused over constant depression and losing my absolute shit on a regular basis anytime lol.",3,1603952415.0

What works for one person may not work for you. The only things to be concerned about with a specific drug in my opinion is whether it has been around for enough years to be proven for safety, and what are the possible side effects best you need to know if you trust it to be worth a try. And what is your family history! That's super important with psych meds. Like if you have a Bipolar parent your doctor shouldn't give you certain things because that actually can kick some people into Bipolar mania who never had it before, because they have the gene.

Antidepressants can be life saving. They can make people feel finally normal and get on with life the way they want to live it! Didn't work for me, but I think I just didn't have a great doctor.

I took Effexor XR for years and it wasn't enough. It made me not ever feel suicidal anymore, but I was still a miserable person. I didn't even believe there was any way my life could get better. I assumed my unhappiness was due to me making dumb choices, being a coward, etc. This was after several years of a ton of therapy and I was in weekly support groups while on medication. I think the Effexor XR may have also been keeping my anxiety from getting extreme. But also I found out this year I have had some other (as yet undefined) mood disorder for like 15 yrs, not just depression and anxiety. 

So, sometimes people find the right meds quickly and easily, but if you take an antidepressant and still don't feel ok, don't be shy to say so and let your doctor give you a higher dose, different meds, or a reevaluation of your health.",1,1706941619.0

Benzos are not to be prescribed for more than 2-4 weeks.  I was on 7 weeks of K after SSRi damage and it really was horrible.  I had to taper a year because my withdrawal symptoms were so bad and I was still damaged from the SSRIs.  I always found my dose drops were hardest day 10.  

Sometimes, if you taper too fast or too big of cuts (5-10% dose drops every 2-4 weeks) which you may be doing they catch up with you.  You may want to stabilize on this dose until you feel better.  That could be weeks or months.  I never made my dose stabilization more than 4 weeks because that is kind of the tolerance higher end.  

There are some things that really helped:

1.  Symptom based taper.
2.  Supplements (magnesium glycinate, omega 3s, ltheanine
3. Distraction (funny comedy shows)
4.  Low impact exercise
5.  Vitamin D

But one thing that I found a tad comforting while coming to terms with having GAD was learning about what happens in your brain. GAD and the lack of seratonin/chronically elevated cortisol (stress hormone) levels actually causes cell death of some of the neurons in the region of your brain that‚Äôs responsible for memory. You are not alone in that feeling and in fact it is a very real and physical result of anxiety. One thing that there is scientific evidence for that does help is consistent cardio-vascular exercise, which seems to help regrow some of those neurons! Which could be anything from a brisk walk/jog for 30+ min a day, just getting your heart rate a bit elevated! Also attempting to reduce stress hormone levels through things like cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and meditation and consistent exercise can help long term, though for me they in no way make my symptoms go away. Just helps manage their severity. You are not alone and I hope this helps!",25,1607873225.0

What helped me:

Finding the right approach: Everyone recovers differently. For me, a combination of strategies worked best. I tried things like memory games, keeping a journal, and even using those sticky note reminders everywhere!

Patience is key: Recovering from memory issues takes time. There will be good days and bad days, but don't get discouraged.

Celebrate the small wins: It's important to acknowledge progress, no matter how small. Maybe you remembered someone's birthday you usually forget, or aced a grocery list without notes. Those little victories add up!

Talk to your doctor: If you're concerned about your memory, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor. They can help identify any underlying causes and recommend additional strategies.

It where when you feeling anxious or have intrusive thoughts to put yourself in a good memory. While in the memory you try to remember every part of it. Like I do the beach. What the ocean sounds like, the wind, the sand under my feet, the smell of the air, what on the beach, how it feels on my skin. Everything possible in the moment. Also it just a memory I made up. I have never experienced what I'm imagining. So you can something you actually done or just make it up. Just make sure it takes all your focus to do.

Then there mindfulness meditation. Which can be a few things. Just being mindful of what you doing. Walking, listening to music, or even eating. While eating focus on how the food taste, the texture, and flavor. Just being mindful during a activity. Your mind will drift but pulling it back what you are doing it what it all about. You cant do it wrong.

Journaling. This just let's me get all my thoughts out without having to speak to someone. It be honest, true, and sometimes even mean. The pages of it wont judge me nor will judge me. Like I'm in therapy. Also when you are having a bad day and struggling you can open it and see that when you and a bad day it wasnt long til you had a good one. So help track growth as well. You dont have yo write every day and it doesnt have to a hundred pages just write until run out of stuff to write about. Then I believe you gotten out everything for that day.

Also reading books or listening to audio books have helped as well. It let's put my mind in another place and I cant think when I'm trying to focus on the book. 
 
Drinking tea is another awesome thing. You can do green tea in the morning. You can do caffeinated or decaf. If anxious that morning do decaf and if not try caffeinated. At night you can drink Tulsi tea. It put me in the dirt when it comes to sleep. I sleep all night and if I do wake up (I'm firefighter. We wake 3 or 4 times a night maybe more) I fall back in sleep with in minutes. Combine Tulsi tea with mediation or a book. Or both I tell you you wont have to worry about  falling sleeping.

If you have more questions or just want to talk. Please message me. I love to have discussions and help people.",2,1607645791.0

gsu1e6,Help for my girlfriend,"My girlfriend has had GAD for about 5-6 years. I have known her and been dating her for almost 1. I have a severe mental disorder myself, so I'm not dumb to treatment options and I'm very aware of what is HER vs what is her disorder. However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. 

 I'm not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, I'm not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot. 

In short, I'm here asking others with the disorder, who deal with similar frustrations to let me know what has worked for you.

However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting.

But if I go through a little longer session calming down allowing those racing thoughts to spread out and hopefully dissipate. They are never gone but more managable. Not dealing with it will increase the intencity. Ive also found having calming scents around helps (I like cashmere woods by glade) and also I have a white noise machine to help give my brain a background noise so I dont have to talk to myself as much. And little side note if you have a smart led bulb that changes colors you can put on like a cyan color that is cool and relaxing. Calming down helps deal with the thoughts. It is hard to think in panic mode..so calming down first and then dealing seems to help me personally,3,1600939677.0

gn5yec,Breathing problems re: anxiety,"I probably have GAD but haven't been officially diagnosed.

1. You're so used to things going wrong in your life that even when things are going well you're waiting for the other shoe to drop - for it all to fall apart. Depression and anxiety are what you're used to and what you're comfortable with. You're not used to being happy and feeling like it's ok to be happy
 Happiness is an unfamiliar feeling you don't know how to comfortably sit with so you think your way out of feeling it

2. Fear of success. I have this but I forgot a lot about it. I think it stems from feeling like you don't deserve sucess like subconcious self hatred?

3. Our brains can't tell the difference between good stress and bad stress. For example I moved into a great new apartment with someone I love and some exciting opportunities are happening in my job but it's making me stressed out and depressed. All that stuff is good but my body doesn't know that. My body just knows it's being fed stress hormones. 

And just know that you're not ungrateful. Life with an anxiety disorder is confusing and hard. We don't expect people with chronic back issues to not feel pain in their back anymore juet because things in their life are going well. Anxiety disorders don't just go away when nice things happen to us even though we wish they would",2,1603953904.0

Isn‚Äôt it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I‚Äôm on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I‚Äôm extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I‚Äôm in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I‚Äôve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don‚Äôt wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it‚Äôs necessary I guess I don‚Äôt have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this.

Depression has also been described as some sort of a problem solving mechanism restraining ressources until the problem is solved. You can help her understand the roots of this fear and the node of this problem. I would recommend talking to a therapist, it helps a gret deal and you should avoid this role as much as possible. On your side anything that you can do to provide safety and stability will help. Perhaps her dad did not express her love so that she perceived it. Most likely something happened in her past and childhood that her mind and body did not tolerate (trauma) and so she fails to feel safe. I recommend reading Gabor Mate's 'When the Body Says No'. Perhaps this video will help too: https://youtu.be/fr3iYr_zZak
Though it may seem scary this situation will evolve and won't stay like this forever. It is up to her to shape her mind and environment (that includes you) in a positive or negative direction. First she wants to ask herself what she lacks or has lacked in the past, and where she could find this security, whose lack thereof creates her fears and anxiety. A large parts of these feelings build over time unconsciously and are rooted in bodily feelings which affect brain chemistry and bodily hormones. Listen to her body and mind, dance therapy can help open new doors to explore and move away from stagnation.",2,1596483399.0

It seems that she has gotten used to her condition, so she needs to get out of it through change. Can you guys travel for a weekend or two, to a nice place where you've never been? She seems to be holding strongly wrong beliefs that keep her from getting out of her state of 'learned helplessness'. Therapy is not for reliving the past but for understanding the deep causes. If she assumes that it is not possible she simply won't go, so that discussion is pointless. She needs a trigger (book, video, friend, etc.) That help her realize that it is possible to understand and control her situation. Her addiction to social media is a distraction maintaining her dissociative state and keeping her to engage with the real world. If she is serious about getting better, she should switch to an old phone without internet connection. Just for a time (probably she will become addict to something else in a while), to see that reality can change based on the decision we take. One of her major problem seems to be that she thinks she knows about things she do not based on her limited experience. Broadening this experience may be a way for her to realize that there are things to be attempted beyond the limits of her imagination and therefore hope and novelty at the end of the tunnel. Taking small steps of success everyday (trying to solve a puzzle, a coffee with a friend, applying to a job, etc) will help. it has to be gradual. Remember it has to be her realization, she has to make it happen by herself. And if she can't or would not, you have to think about yourself and set boundaries on what you can and cannot take and act upon your own ideals of a life well lived.",2,1596701909.0
gh8s7e,throwing up on purpose due to anxiety?,"background info: i'm a 17 year old female, been diagnosed with GAD and depression and have been taking 20mg of prozac since september.

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds.

I've never heard of 10mg being used as treatment, only for tapering off. I'm on 20mg and it has effectively ""switched off"" my anxiety. However, it takes 6 - 8 weeks to work and in that time, you might feel a little worse temporarily or have some nausea. 

I had a small amount of weight gain as a side effect, which is fine. The only other side effect is that it also pretty much switches off your libido, which is crap. But, it really is amazing the effect it's had on me so I'm happy to stay on it for a while longer at least. 

I occasionally get a little anxious but it's much more in the normal realm. Having said that, I have done lots of counselling and have good coping mechanisms. I had done all the psychological work but it was like my body was just programmed to constantly panick. Once that was switched off, I was fine. Couldn't be happier. I know other people though who haven't really worked on their actual problems and so Citalopram helps, and can really help with the clarity and motivation to work on those problems, but it wouldn't have the absolutely life changing impact it has on me.",2,1588773554.0

I didn't think it'll help (I just hoped it will) but I gave it a shot - after a month I started to feel better, I get anxious sometimes but I can work it out myself by using logic and breathing techniques that my therapist taught me. 

I guess at first you yourself might notice tiny, small changes in your behavior, you might notice that things that triggered you before don't trigger you as much as they used to and such. Over time you'll see that quite a few things have changed. It's not huge but for me a big moment was when I could drink coffee again - it didn't make me anxious anymore.",2,1588783761.0

g9jivx,Experiences with treatment?," I just found out I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and I have had it for as long as I can remember.

I always thought about it as I live normally, but I have some kind of  chemical inbalance in my body/brain. I wanted to fix it with some pills, or thinking differently, or trying to fight it.

Though recently I have realized that as human species we don't live ""normally"", i.e. how it was intended by nature. I don't say that we live worse, just that our bodies and our minds exist in the artificial environment.   


Some bodies/brains adapt to it better.  Some have troubles with it, which may result in depression, anxiety, never ending feeling of stress.

This book talks about it in great detail

I'd suggest to start with very simple things, you can always proceed with complicated stuff later.

We have a strict anti-opioid policy were I live. So I reached for a classic pain killer -- alcohol.

Also want to say that AA has a LOW success rate. Why? Because alcoholism is about NUTRITION. It requires mega doses of Supplements and a good diet to heal. Read the book: Seven weeks til sobriety. Super enlightening!

It sounds like you're working through a lot. I know these times are difficult. The best general advice I've ever received in working through my GAD, Depression, and Panic Disorder is to be kind to yourself. While it is true that you harmed yourself, today is a new day and carrying the guilt of relapse will not help you get through today. Let go of the guilt you cannot change anything about yesterday's relapse. We can work on today. 

Regarding therapy and medication during quarantine - do you have health insurance? I contacted my health insurance provider and they informed me that they have a contract with teladoc to provide free telehealth therapy. It's been immensely helpful for me over the past couple of weeks as my usual psychiatrist/therapist is in another state.

When you do have a chance to chat with a prescribing physician I would suggest discussing with them trial periods of the first-line treatments like selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SSRIs or SNRIs may be more efficacious or helpful in working through depression and GAD. I know that it has been the case for me.

1. Don‚Äôt eat meat- I found meat would destroy my appetite even when I was hungry
2. Eat simple and small - Apple here yogurt there, maybe some crackers later. Just nibble even if it takes hours
3. Think uplifting - while you are nibbling keep telling yourself that you are doing great, you are making progress. This is baby step 1. The more and more small wins you have the easier it will become.

It is never a nausea like you had something bad to eat, is just like I have a heavy brick in my estomach and throwing up will help. It is not rational.
When I was a child through my teenager years - I was terrified to throw up. Once i had to call my building doorman to hold my hand because i didnt want to throw up by myself.

This fear can install a lot of anxiety because you keep antecipating that you might throw up. I can only imagine how stressfull it must be to you. 

I am currently going through a relapse of my anxiety and my psychiatrist put me back in medication. For the short term he advised on a benzodiazepine for me to take if I have a too much of a bad crisis and something else on long term. I also use CBD.

My experience is that it takes about 2 weeks to level out, then people around you will start noticing you are responding to a stimulus better than before meds.

I had terrible nightmares and intense anxiety but this goes away. The benefits of the meds are worth it in the long run! Be sure to tell your doctor about how you feel.  They may prescribe an as needed med for the spikes. (I'm not a doctor,  just my experience. )

If you notice the pressure and other symptoms as anxiety,  it can help to remind yourself of that, so you can try to remember you aren't actually dying.

Try and ride it out! Give the transition period a chance to pass. Report side effects to your doctor.   I promise it will get better.  You can do this!!!",1,1586528235.0

I was told that I was too high-functioning, mainly because I maintain friendships, romantic relationships, work and study. In their eyes (in my case, public health care system) won't really help you unless you can't manage your every day life, aka. keeping your job etc.   


  
I can manage, and I have all my life, but I am constantly, physically tense from worrying, over-thinking and being in a semi-fight or flight state. I manage my every day life because I have designed it to be as least uncomfortable as possible. I avoid applying for jobs that have night shifts, which require me to be alone at work or go home while it's dark. I make my friends or SO drive me where I need to go, so I never have to drive myself. I force myself to eat a full meal before any work or study every day, so I don't convince myself I'm fainting while in class or whatever. Just a few of many examples of what I've done to live somewhat peacefully, and not having to deal with the anxiety ""head on"". I have become extremely controlling of my every day life. If things don't go according to that plan- which, especially in social settings, is frequent, I immediately have difficulty adapting to it. It's instant worry, working out every possible scenario of what will go down, finding out how to get home, how to get food etc. I can't, and have never been able to ""take it as it comes"" with anything.  


  
I used to have panic attacks, but after I got better at preventing them by making sure I ate well, got enough sleep and cut down on caffeine, I've been considered too high-functioning for any proper psychologist. Most of the time I don't think of myself as mentally ill, even writing it out sounds strange to me. But at the same time, it seems wild that my GAD (which is my diagnosis) is treated, and also experienced by me, as a personality trait. Even the way I move, my body language- is percieved as someone anxious, someone uncomfortable.   


&#x200B;

I can not remember a time I was ever fully relaxed. I want more than anything to just jump on something, go with the flow, take things as they come etc. I want to run and jump up a couch and lie down. Even when I imagine myself doing that, in my imagination I break at least 2 lamps, make someone yell at me and I injure my back in the process.

I have had a very similar experience, and I know how invalidating it can be. If you feel you would benefit from therapy, then that's the only pre-rec you need to attend. 

I was basically told by two mental health care professionals at my college that my GPA was too high for me to need therapy. I'm sensitive, so that was pretty difficult as it took me about 6 months from the first incident to try again, with the exact same thing to happen again. In my case, the clinic was too overbooked and understaffed. Therefore, they were more focused on other clients I guess... so maybe that is what is happening with you as well? 

All I know is that real therapy is open to anyone, and I would really encourage you to try again. I have been seeing a counselor through a different department of my college & he never devalues my experience.

I'm sorry to hear that you've had poor experiences with the mental health care system. Do you have a primary care physician (PCP)? Most GAD/Depression in the US is being treated by PCPs. I would suggest trying to schedule a telehealth appointment with your PCP and raise the concerns you've mentioned. Especially that it's ""affecting my daily functioning"" and are having difficulty accessing a prescribing psychiatrist. Most PCPs feel comfortable starting GAD patients on a prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhbitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). SSRIs and SNRIs are the first line drugs for GAD. I hope this helps!",1,1587231279.0

Travelling is my main problem, I can do short distances in town but leaving is a whole other thing.

What if my phone runs out and I'm running down the highway screaming from an anxiety attack? What if I have to stop and wait for construction but I can't move my car and everyone gets upset?

Another is work, I absolutely cannot do 9-5 because I cannot be expected to stay in one place day in and day out without be able to leave when I need to. So I started my own cleaning business. I choose my own hours, choose how full I want my schedule and who my clients are. Its changed my life and empowered me.

I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either. After 22 hours I'll be able to call into my employer and probably get someone to talk to, and hopefully a medication that would stop this particular attack. I already learned how to cope with this and what works for me and what doesn't. I'm mentally in a good state most of the time but my body won't let it go. I don't like the idea of starting a regular medication but I guess it should be a positive thing longer term.

Basically if your anxiety worries you then it‚Äôs a disorder but if it doesn‚Äôt (maybe you‚Äôre just trying to live with it) it‚Äôs not a disorder. Is this true? I just really want to know like 100% if I have GAD or not.,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/generalizedanxiety/comments/f2oe7k/what_makes_an_anxiety_disorder/,1581497714.0,fhdrmks,"That's a bit of a weird description but basically correct, when I studied psychology I learned that something is only a disorder when it interferes with the person's daily life.

So if you tend to worry a lot but it doesn't hold you back in your daily life (or at least you don't perceive it that way), it's not a disorder because you're not bothered by it. But if you feel that it's holding you back in life and if you're not doing things that you would like to do because of your anxiety (*and* the other criteria apply to you as well, of course), then it's a disorder. It's likely that if you went to get help in the first place, you did so because you felt your symptoms were holding you back in some way, or were making you unhappy. People don't usually look for help when they feel they're fine (even if, to an outsider, it might seem that they're worrying overly much).

This goes for all mental disorders: one of the requirements for it to be a disorder is that the symptoms cause 'significant distress  or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning'.

If you got help for your symptoms, that means they were causing you distress, which means a diagnosis of anxiety disorder should be valid.",3,1581498135.0

Anyways, the best thing to do with anything like this is to see a professional. There you can explain what issues you are having (to the best of your ability) and they'll assist you in developing strategies to cope with what they think is the issue. Then, medication is number 2. The combination of those two are more than enough to solve this problem in my opinion.",1,1580879881.0

eqw13z,recently diagnosedddd,"So i was recently diagnosed with GAD.

i was prescribed Clonazepam (klonopin) for anxiety/panic attacks. among other things for the anxiety itself.

anyone else have experience with this medication? thoughts?",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/generalizedanxiety/comments/eqw13z/recently_diagnosedddd/,1579439375.0,feznas2,"I am on a very low dose of Klonopin, and it has done wonders for me. My anxiety/panic is absolutely horrible in the morning, and I often find myself physically sick to my stomach before going to work. Klonopin allows me to calm down to the point where I am able to have some sort of control over my emotions. It does not take away my anxiety completely, as no drug will, but definitely makes it more manageable. 

My advice is to make sure you use it only as directed by your doctor as it is easy to become dependent on it. And to talk to your doctor immediately if you feel like you are becoming too heavily reliant on the drug. Hopefully your other meds will help balance you out so you will not need to take it too often.

Also, do not pressure yourself and do not plan ahead. For me planning ahead would give me even more anxiety because of overthinking.
Just reach out to your friends on a day you feel good and do easy things with them at first.
For example, if you feel more comfortable hanging out at your place just ask them to come over.
Also one thing that worked really well for me was going for a walk in the woods or park with my friends. Nature and fresh air work really relaxing on the body and I noticed that when I'm focussing on walking and taking in my surroundings I overthink a lot less.

Because, now you have a name for it, you have confirmation and affirmation that there is genuinely something going on, and there is treatment.  I was diagnosed with GAD around age 7 and have been on one medication or another since around age 9-10 because I was having regular, intense panic attacks.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) should become your new best friend.  If you need medication after being in therapy with not enough relief of symptoms, then take medication... But please don't stop therapy.  

It's also good to know that not all therapists will be a good fit for you.  Take the time to find one you click with.

You're looking for a new therapist and staying active and busy! 


I wonder if they maybe meant a psychiatrist since you've already been seeing a therapist. Psychiatrists are the ones that are able to prescribe meds. (I'm not saying you should or shouldn't take meds, that's not my call to make)


You said you were getting better when you were doing therapy. That's awesome! Not all therapy and therapists are created equal and you're now familiar with one way of going about things which is helpful to you. It might not be the only style that's helpful to you but you at least know that there is *at least* one type that is. 

My therapist just recommended I listen to a guided meditation before bed. Have you tried any of those? I haven't yet but I also have issues getting caught up in negative thoughts and then can't sleep. Like I said, I haven't tried it yet (hmm I'll try it tonight) but thought I'd throw it out there!

I have a friend who started therapy for anxiety when he was a teenager and while it didn't go away completely, damn, he is pro at managing it. I think that's going to be you. It might start to bubble up, but you'll know how to get it to simmer down.


I wish I knew for sure what things are actually helpful to say! Hopefully something in there helped at least a tinyyyy bit. And if not, hopefully someone comes along with a better response.

I worked in a very abusive company which is kind of what triggered my anxiety to become life threatening, getting on Buspar helped but I also had to find my way out of the job situation because it was a trigger.

I was in a high pressure job that had taken over my personal life, and I mean literally, my manager was dominating my personal life also.  Buspar helped me clear the clouds a bit so I could bring myself to apply for new jobs and be a functional human to be able to interview and all that.  From there, the problems started to clear up, I distanced myself from those toxic people in my life and started doing new things.  I think that's an important part, my therapist helped me see that.

(1) If she is anxious ask her what you can do? Depending on where she is in the anxious moment she may say ‚ÄúNothing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù but the offer matters. 

(2) Ask her ‚ÄúDoes everything feel not quite real?‚Äù If she says ‚ÄúYes‚Äù then she is depersonalizing. This, essentially, means that her anxiety is overwhelming every sense and she feels like she is not quite a part of her surroundings. Ask her to stand up. Tell her to trust you. And then give her a big bear hug and to hold on as long as she can. The tightness will help push her sense of touch into the forefront, above the anxiety, and bring her ‚Äúback‚Äù after a minute or two. If a hug is too intense and makes her feel entrapped, a firm hand hold can help too. 

(3) If she snaps at you at all, try not to react. When anxiety is pushes all of her buttons she is trapped between her fight or flight response since she can‚Äôt run away from her own brain. So fight tends to be externalized. She‚Äôll apologize when she pushes beyond the anxiety.

bep2wt,Advice for friend (F/20) who is suffering but won't seek help?,"Friend of mine (F/20) is constantly worrying (sometimes to the point of feeling physically sick) about everything in her life that could go wrong but will never really happen if you think about it, e.g. she worries she'll get breast cancer, that she won't get married, that she won't pass law exams that she cannot do until we finish our undergrad degree (at least two and a half years away) and these are exams that she doesn't even think she will do because she doesn't actually want to be a lawyer. She constantly puts herself down and says she's not good at things that from an outside perspective (other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this) seems like she's just looking for validation because it's obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she won't do anything about it. I've asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor (she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldn't do this but I do think she suffers from it) I've told her I'm worried about her, I've told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like I'm talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and I'm getting to the stage where I've stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because she's just not listening. I'm beginning to feel annoyed every time she puts herself down and I'm really trying not to but it's really hard to keep propping someone else's self-esteem up. Don't get me wrong I love this girl, she's practically my best friend but recently the relationship has been exhausting and I don't know how I can get through to her.

I'm not a professional but so I hesitate to give you a diagnosis other than she needs professional help.   It's actually becoming more and more common during college years for mental health issues to arise. We put a lot of stress on ourselves. I kept thinking it was normal to feel this way and it took some convincing for me to seek out help.  Medication has helped me immensely manage Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It didnt change my personality but it did help me to get out of my head. It sounds like your friend is in her head as well and isn't hearing what you are trying to tell her. 

If she were my friend, I would stop threatening to call her mom. A few things to think about. 

1. Are there any resources at the University that could help her? If you don't know. Find out. 

2.  Offer to go with her to the doctor's office.  She needs help taking that first step. Trust me. You don't need to go into the actual appointment or anything. 

3. If she puts off getting help don't threaten to call her mom. Go ahead and contact her mom in private and share your concerns. 

4. Last resort. Stage an intervention about her behavior and ask that she talk to a thearapist.  Suround her with people that love/care about her. 

You might loose her as a friend but I think it would outweigh the possibility of something worse happening.",1,1555621567.0

apm23i,Medication advice please,"Hey

Hoping for some advice. 

Was on cipralex for 7 years and it allowed me to be happy and live life. Then it stopped working! I was on a high dose. 

Since then, have tried:

Fetzima- gave me heart palpitations and high BP
Lyrica- kept breaking through despite upped doses
Propranalol- just made me tired, no other effects 
Trintellix-just didn‚Äôt feel good on it after 2 months. No real change to my mood. 

Currently on 300mg of Trileptal which is a mood stabilizer, and not doing so well. 

My thoughts are to try another SSRI such as Zoloft or Prozac, given how well Cipralex worked for me.  Or, try another SSRI, perhaps Pristiq, cymbalta or Effexor. 

I don‚Äôt like cocktails of meds, as I find it‚Äôs impossible to know what‚Äôs doing what. I think my last cocktail made me worse.

My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind.

I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help.

I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help. I am going to see a phsyc again and am not looking for reassurance but am really scared so if anyone can help at all. Is paranoia like this common with depersonalization?

I suffered from depersonalisation / derealisation myself and always had the fear that this were some sign for me having schizophrenia. However, as my doctor told me: A schizophrenic person would never ask himself if he is schizophrenic. The fact that you are aware of your feelings shows that you are only terribly frightened and have intrusive thoughts about being paranoid and stuff. The mind is perfectly good at pretending to be what you fear the most. 

You should seek for help for your anxiety and disturbing thoughts. It really helps. There also is a subreddit dealing with depersonalisation / derealisation in particular. The people over there surely can relate to what you say. It‚Äôs /dpdr. 

I wish you all the best! Seek for help and it will get better :)",3,1530890849.0

I play lots of games and I recently read an article that basically any game with violence can make you an aggressive person. I play lots of violent games, ( well things like Terraria, Fortnite, and no I‚Äôm not a 10 year old, and some WW2 plane games here and there ) will that make me so aggressive that I‚Äôll hurt someone?
