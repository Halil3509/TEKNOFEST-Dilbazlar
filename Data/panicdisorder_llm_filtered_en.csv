yes,"it only happens at night when I'm stressed out and laying down; never in the morning, it's highly annoying ü´† it's one of my worse issues for anxiety besides stomach and nausea issues; just checking if anyone else gets something similar cause Google makes nothing better lol"
yes,"I did this back in 2022 and had panic attacks after panic attacks. I‚Äôm scared. I have emergency meds this time around, but I get so in my head and don‚Äôt want to ruin another trip."
yes,"I haven‚Äôt dated in years because my social anxiety gets triggered and I‚Äôm scared of having a panic attack. Usually I just end up ghosting someone when they ask to meet up, but I‚Äôm trying to face my fears."
yes,"Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that‚Äôs most responsive to self-help.

 Someone here says that journaling helps.

The problem with coping methods like slow breathing and sticking your face in a bowl of water you keep in the fridge is that the attacks can keep coming back.

So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns.

Dr. Burns is the author recommended most often by mental health professionals, according to Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health.

Psychology Today online says that Dr. David Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook. Dr. Carbonell says that the way to breathe during a panic attack is slowly, using the big muscle under the stomach. Put a hand on your belly to feel it go out when you inhale.

A good exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.

There‚Äôs a lot of talk about the DARE app and the DARE YouTube videos. The reviews are very positive.

One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. Then the attacks become less frequent and finally go away altogether.

I‚Äôll tell you about two other things that you probably won‚Äôt need. It‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre there if you need them.

A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.

There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise."
yes,I did take something one time tho and I believe it was this and I felt the same way.
yes,"Lol I did the same thing last month. It was in fact just my anxiety. Assuming you bought some quality ashwaganda supplements I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much to worry about. I stopped taking mine cause it gave me too much gas, but if you‚Äôre looking for something to help calm down before bed you could try the Olly melatonin gummies. I like those alot (coming from someone with a panic disorder as well). Only thing is I take half the recommended dose because if I take full I get nightmares."
yes,"My first panic attack was when I was driving on the expressway home and I can recall just feeling so trapped and wanting to just get off. I could feel like an impending doom and in my 04‚Äô Ford Focus I drove over 80+ mph to get off the expressway.

The panic attacks continued and eventually I decided to get help. My doctor prescribed me Duloxetine which ended up putting me in the hospital due to severe suicidal thoughts.

My mental hospital was such a horrible experience and after leaving my agoraphobia begin and panic attacks continued. I seriously couldn‚Äôt drive further than a block from my home. This went on for about 2 months dreading every day I woke up.

Eventually I did end up getting a medication that worked to calm my panic attacks. But the problem was I developed a ptsd when going out afraid of having one. My mom luckily was a great supporter for me and continued to force me to go on drives.

My radius did end up expanding and although I am not where I wanna be I am definitely making progress. It has been 2 years since and I‚Äôve been able to make 30 minute drives now which is a big milestone for me. I also just entered a relationship and my girlfriend is very supportive and pushing me to get out my comfort zone. I am also going to be graduating with my bachelors in accounting within the year."
yes,"I‚Äôve never tried marijuana in any capacity, so I‚Äôm not even sure what it feels like to begin with. But I‚Äôm considering giving it a try to help with my Panic Disorder and PTSD struggles. However, I‚Äôve heard from many folks that it can actually exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Although I‚Äôve also heard certain strains are better for anxiety than others. I‚Äôm also not looking to feel impaired. I‚Äôm a mom. I need to be able to function relatively well just without the anxiety. Is that even a thing? 
I‚Äôm on an SSRI but only just started and I really need help in this adjustment period or for more challenging moments as sort of a ‚Äúrescue‚Äù medication. 
Curious what everyone has experienced in their attempts to resolve panic with marijuana."
yes,"So. I've had panic disorder for a long time. But unfortunately, as I'm sure most of you know, that doesn't make it easier to handle. 

I have a minor surgery in 8 days. I've had surgery before- in fact, I've had this same surgery before.. but I'm freaking the fuck out. About nothing in particular and also everything. I can't eat cause I feel like the anxiety is gonna make me throw up. I'm exhausted and it's hard to rest. All of this on top of the pain I already go through and the pain I'm going through because of this kidney stone that I need removed. 

I don't really know what to do.. I have therapy Wednesday, and I'm hoping that'll help a little. But I feel like I can't function and I don't know what to do. I feel like if I keep panicking, I'm gonna end up calling and canceling the surgery and I really can't do that cause it needs to happen. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to keep myself calm in the days leading up? How to get some sleep and stuff? The anxiety meds I'm on aren't really helping.. and all the panic is making my dissociative disorders worse and I'm scared that I'm gonna end up triggering my schizo because of it. I just need a way to stay calm so I can get through this shit.. "
yes,"My agoraphobia is at a point where I can only leave my house on medication with one of 2 people I trust and that's like 2-3 times a month. I am having panic attacks everyday multiple times, long lasting. My health anxiety is always on. I am so very alone I cannot get any help when I am loosing my will to live. 4 day weekend and my husband spent 85% of it playing video games. I told him my panic was getting worse and I felt he wasn't supportive and he left the room and gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the night and the entire next day. I feel like my dogs are the only reason I keep going but I feel like I have had enough. I won't ever seek help that could put my into a psych hospital. I would rather die than go through that. I'm sick and tired and just want it to stop."
yes,my panic disorder is in full effect. I am back to where I was in college .. my doc doesn‚Äôt give me a straight answer. I don‚Äôt have the zaps or any of that anymore just my anxiety / panic the reason I started.
