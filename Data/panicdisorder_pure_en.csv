1dytnya,stomach pulsing,"does anyone else get the feeling where your heart feels like it's in your stomach?

I haven‚Äôt dated in years because my social anxiety gets triggered and I‚Äôm scared of having a panic attack.

I have nothing against that supplement. It's just that the evidence for therapy and self-help is stronger than the evidence for medication.

The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known.

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that‚Äôs most responsive to self-help.

 Someone here says that journaling helps.

The problem with coping methods like slow breathing and sticking your face in a bowl of water you keep in the fridge is that the attacks can keep coming back.

So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns.

Dr. Burns is the author recommended most often by mental health professionals, according to Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health.

Psychology Today online says that Dr. David Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook. Dr. Carbonell says that the way to breathe during a panic attack is slowly, using the big muscle under the stomach. Put a hand on your belly to feel it go out when you inhale.

A good exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.

There‚Äôs a lot of talk about the DARE app and the DARE YouTube videos. The reviews are very positive.

One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. Then the attacks become less frequent and finally go away altogether.

I‚Äôll tell you about two other things that you probably won‚Äôt need. It‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre there if you need them.

A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.

There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.",2,1720489672.0

I stopped taking mine cause it gave me too much gas, but if you‚Äôre looking for something to help calm down before bed you could try the Olly melatonin gummies. I like those alot (coming from someone with a panic disorder as well). Only thing is I take half the recommended dose because if I take full I get nightmares.

1dyjb7b,Agoraphobia,"Okay so, where do I begin.

My first panic attack was when I was driving on the expressway home and I can recall just feeling so trapped and wanting to just get off. I could feel like an impending doom and in my 04‚Äô Ford Focus I drove over 80+ mph to get off the expressway.

The panic attacks continued and eventually I decided to get help. My doctor prescribed me Duloxetine which ended up putting me in the hospital due to severe suicidal thoughts.

My mental hospital was such a horrible experience and after leaving my agoraphobia begin and panic attacks continued. I seriously couldn‚Äôt drive further than a block from my home. This went on for about 2 months dreading every day I woke up.

Eventually I did end up getting a medication that worked to calm my panic attacks. But the problem was I developed a ptsd when going out afraid of having one. My mom luckily was a great supporter for me and continued to force me to go on drives.

Odds might not be in your favour though as cannabis is known to cause heightened feelings of anxiety in a good bit of users, especially first timers.


You're right that certain strains and THC/CBD ratios of your flower, oil and/or edibles can be a better solution for different people. (Terpenes are even mentioned)


Ask your GP, dispensary or consult with a cannabis doc, they would be able to help a lot more having your medical history.

I had my first panic attack after smoking weed for the first time - it didn't trigger my PD, that came later, but weed makes people really anxious. I use very low dose high CBD edibles on occasion now, but I have a pretty good relationship with my PD as well as with marijuana. That came from practice and a little bit of misery to be honest. The medication effects it has don't happen for everyone, and I just don't think it's worthwhile to risk it. I find it's much more helpful for depression than anxiety.",2,1720460567.0

Because they had symptoms that were frightening they continued on being frightened of experiencing the symptoms again which in turn caused panic disorder. 

I will say majority of people here have no had good experiences with it, if you already experience attacks or physical symptoms you will most likely exasperate them by smoking. However there are a lot of people that do use this as a way to relieve anxiety, and it has been helpful to many people. CBD has also been known to relax individuals without the high. 

All in all it‚Äôs almost like how you approach medication. Everyone is going to react differently, some it‚Äôs helpful and some it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs kind of a thing where you need to experiment with it!",2,1720461660.0

1dy9sgd,Surgery & Panic,"So. I've had panic disorder for a long time. But unfortunately, as I'm sure most of you know, that doesn't make it easier to handle. 

I have a minor surgery in 8 days. I've had surgery before- in fact, I've had this same surgery before.. but I'm freaking the fuck out. About nothing in particular and also everything. I can't eat cause I feel like the anxiety is gonna make me throw up. I'm exhausted and it's hard to rest. All of this on top of the pain I already go through and the pain I'm going through because of this kidney stone that I need removed. 

I don't really know what to do.. I have therapy Wednesday, and I'm hoping that'll help a little. But I feel like I can't function and I don't know what to do. I feel like if I keep panicking, I'm gonna end up calling and canceling the surgery and I really can't do that cause it needs to happen. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to keep myself calm in the days leading up? How to get some sleep and stuff? The anxiety meds I'm on aren't really helping.. and all the panic is making my dissociative disorders worse and I'm scared that I'm gonna end up triggering my schizo because of it.

So let‚Äôs start with the obvious, your husband is terrible for not being supportive of you and giving you a silent treatment. Secondly you will never get over agoraphobia if you do not take the steps to go through exposure therapy, this is how you get over this. 3rd thing is you need to seek therapy, this will be extremely important in getting you through this and learning how to. Lastly, your mindset determines so much of the outcomes you can receive. I understand that this disorder is extremely difficult and can cause depression easily but you can‚Äôt let it win over you like that. If you have a completely negative mindset all the time it will make it that much harder to heal, and you have to be WILLING and ACCEPTING to get help or you won‚Äôt make progress.",2,1720442658.0

It saddens me your husband gave you the silent treatment. I know how hard it can be for our loved ones to deal with what we‚Äôre going through, but the silent treatment definitely won‚Äôt help resolve anything.

Health anxiety & agoraphobia is the fear of experiencing fear. You say that you‚Äôd rather die, so I challenge you, if you‚Äôd rather die, why not go outside by yourself and see what happens?

You may as well try, it‚Äôs better than dying, that‚Äôs for sure.

What likely will happen, is you‚Äôll experience sensations that you‚Äôve had a million times before. You‚Äôre so familiar with them by now that it‚Äôs time you get comfortable with them. They‚Äôre a part of your sensitised mind.

The more you‚Äôre able to accept without fuelling the panic with fear, the less you‚Äôll experience panic.

It‚Äôs so much easier said than done, but it‚Äôs worth a go before dying, right?",1,1720437100.0

For instance, if you‚Äôve stopped taking an SSRI that was working, and you didn‚Äôt really have a plan other than to come off of it (e.g. no other therapy), you now know that this is something you shouldn‚Äôt do.",1,1720410157.0

I‚Äôve personally dealt with huge rebound anxiety after coming off of medications as a result of what the medication was able to do for me. That wasn‚Äôt necessarily withdrawal, just me not learning to cope without it. The panic was much more intense in this case.",1,1720410272.0

I am thinking about reinstating my SSRI because I've tried so hard for almost a year to get past this withdrawal, and it just keeps on keeping on. Here is my thinking.  If I have to be on meds forever, well, I have an anxiety disorder and that's what I need.  Mental health issues just are.  Sometimes we need help.  Your brain is not ruined.  Your brain is anxious, that's all.  It's not your fault and it's not a failure to take meds.  Do what you have to to get through.  Even if you try a SSRI again, no one says it's forever.

Not very good sounds like an understatement. 2 weeks is awfully quick to come off any medication, especially one you‚Äôve been on a while. Are you in a position to get a new one?

I really think you should ask yourself:
1. Am I willing to put in the effort to find a new strategy to cope with my disorder in replacement of the medication?

2. Would I be okay with taking medication long-term, despite any potential side effects, if it drastically improves my life?
