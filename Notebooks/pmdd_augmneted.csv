"It makes me suspect it was pivotally detrimental to my hormonal health and could have been the foundation for the symptoms I experience today, nearly ten years later."
"I'm starting to think that event was incredibly bad for my hormones, and it might be the reason I'm still dealing with these problems today."
"It's making me wonder if that experience was a major turning point for my hormonal health, and if it's the root cause of what I'm going through now."
"I can't help but think that what happened back then had a significant negative impact on my hormones, and it could be the reason for the symptoms I'm experiencing even today."
"Looking back, I'm convinced that experience was a major blow to my hormonal system, and it might be the foundation for the problems I'm still struggling with."
"I'm starting to connect the dots and think that this event was truly detrimental to my hormonal balance, and could have laid the groundwork for the symptoms I'm dealing with even today."
"I'm 'again in PMDD', like of course my cycle repeats"
"I'm stuck in this PMS hell again, it's like clockwork."
"Another month, another round of PMDD.  It's so predictable."
"Ugh, here we go again with the PMDD. My body is a broken record."
"My cycle is like a broken record, always playing the same song - PMDD."
"I'm back in the PMDD cycle, it's like a curse."
"I'm feeling fine and I'm like so I really need to do this??! ...my moods usually kick in around 7-10 days prior to coming on, and I'm already t minus 7 days."
"I'm feeling a bit off, like I'm going to be really emotional soon."
"I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but I'm definitely feeling different."
"I've been feeling this way for a week now, and it's only going to get worse."
"I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard when I'm feeling so emotional."
I just want to get through this week and then I can start feeling normal again.
"I'm so sad and moody... I feel like I haven't felt joy in so long... I'm no where close to it being over. It sucks when I feel like I'm doing a lot to feel good and it's still not working. I just have to accept that I feel sad and anxious and worst of all, SO TIRED."
"I feel so emotionally drained, like all the effort I put into being happy just isn't enough."
"I'm tired of this constant cycle of feeling down, trying to find a way out, and failing."
"It's frustrating when I put in so much work to feel better, but I still feel stuck in this negativity."
"The fatigue of feeling sad and anxious is wearing me down, I just wish I could feel a spark of joy again."
"I'm exhausted from all the effort I'm putting in to feel better, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up."
After several appointments I have finally been given the green light to have my uterus and lady balls removed.
I'm finally getting the surgery I've been waiting for to remove my uterus and ovaries.
"After months of waiting, I've finally been cleared to have my hysterectomy and oophorectomy."
"It's been a long road, but I'm finally getting the surgery I need to remove my reproductive organs."
My doctor has finally given me the go-ahead to have my uterus and ovaries removed.
I'm so relieved to finally have the date for my surgery to remove my uterus and ovaries.
"my pmdd gets brought up, everyone seems to have an opinion and a suggestion about how I should be living. ...I have said multiple times I’m over constantly being on different bc’s and drugs that just make it worse Id much rather find a routine and homeopathic ways that better suit me."
"I'm tired of people telling me how to manage my PMDD, like they know what's best for me."
It's frustrating when people think they can just offer advice about something as personal and complex as PMDD.
"I've tried countless medications and birth control options, but nothing seems to work for me."
I'm exploring alternative approaches like homeopathy and lifestyle changes to find a solution that works for me.
I just want to find a way to manage my PMDD that doesn't involve constantly experimenting with different drugs.
"I experience a lot of insecurity, self hatred, Jealousy and crying during luteal."
"I feel incredibly vulnerable, ashamed of myself, envious of others, and prone to tears during the luteal phase."
"The luteal phase brings with it a heavy weight of self-doubt, disgust, and longing, often leaving me feeling like I'm drowning in tears."
"My emotions run rampant during the luteal phase, characterized by insecurity, self-loathing, intense jealousy, and an overwhelming urge to cry."
"The luteal phase is a difficult time for me, marked by a wave of insecurity, self-hatred, jealousy, and an uncontrollable need to cry."
"I find myself struggling with a constant sense of inadequacy, loathing for myself, envy for others, and a constant stream of tears during the luteal phase."
I’ve been really struggling with my PMDD and hormonal anxiety to the point where I’m beginning to miss work. I’m down bad. I’m bipolar
My PMDD and hormonal anxiety are so intense that it’s impacting my ability to work. I’m really struggling.
"I’ve been feeling so down and anxious lately, it’s affecting my work. I’m not sure what to do."
My mood swings have been so bad lately that I’m even missing work. I feel like I’m losing control.
The emotional rollercoaster I’ve been on has been making it hard to function. I’m really worried about my job.
This hormonal stuff is really taking a toll on me. I’m feeling so overwhelmed and stressed out.
Struggling to work and overthinking everything. I keep thinking it’s better if I quit my job and leave my partner and start everything over. This happens every month like clockwork.
"I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a complete upheaval, like everything is wrong and needs to be ripped apart and rebuilt."
"This cycle of doubt and frustration is so predictable, it's almost comical."
"Sometimes I just want to throw it all away and start fresh, even though I know it's a fleeting feeling."
"It's exhausting to be constantly questioning everything, especially when the answers seem so far out of reach."
I wish I could just turn off this mental hamster wheel and focus on the present moment.
I relapsed right before my period... I'm so so so ashamed of myself and I'm afraid I'll just repeat this again next month. I have to take better care of myself somehow but I've started internalizing this all over again that I'm a piece of shit and I'm just the kind of person who can't control urges like this.
"I feel like I'm letting myself down, and I'm worried it's going to happen again next month."
"This is so discouraging, I feel like I'm trapped in this cycle."
"I hate this feeling of failure, it's like I can't get ahead of myself."
"I'm so frustrated with myself for not being able to stop, it's like I'm powerless."
"I'm trying to be kinder to myself, but I keep falling back into these negative thoughts."
I'm sitting alone crying avoiding my partner because I hate him today and he's not being helpful
"I feel so hurt and rejected right now, I can't even face him."
"He's just not understanding what I'm going through, and it's making things worse."
I just need some space to process everything and get my emotions in check.
I can't believe he's acting like this when I'm so upset and need his support.
"I feel so alone and misunderstood, I just want to disappear."
"5 weeks of no energy, no motivation, no appetite, too much sensitivity (emotional, but also to heat, light, some tastes, etc.)"
"I've been completely drained for the past five weeks. No energy, no drive, and I can barely even eat.  Plus, I'm so sensitive to everything -  emotions, heat, light, even certain tastes."
"The last five weeks have been a blur of exhaustion, apathy, and overwhelming sensitivity. I feel like I'm stuck in a fog."
"It's been five weeks of feeling like a deflated balloon. No energy, no desire to do anything, and every little thing seems to bother me."
"For the past five weeks, I've been battling fatigue, lack of motivation, and an overwhelming sensitivity to everything around me.  It's like my body is constantly on edge."
"I've been feeling completely depleted for the past five weeks. My energy is gone, my motivation is nonexistent, and I'm hypersensitive to everything.  It's incredibly difficult to function."
"I feel like my phone just adds to the problem. Lately I’ve been experiencing extreme bouts of loneliness... it’s just getting too physically taxing. I feel like many of my friends are just so busy with their own lives; with others, we’ve changed a lot to the point where our personalities are no longer compatible. It’s stressing me out so much. I know it’ll take time for this new journey I’m on to take effect, but how do I cope with the transition ? There’s constantly a pit in my stomach."
"It feels like I'm losing touch with everyone, and it's starting to wear me down."
I'm struggling to find a balance between my own life and the constant pressure to connect with others.
"My social battery is completely drained, and I'm not sure how to recharge it."
"I'm exhausted from trying to fit into everyone's lives, but I also feel isolated when I don't."
This whole process of finding my place is making me feel so anxious and overwhelmed.
I have had PMDD since my early 20's...My symptoms have been a night and day difference.
My life was drastically different before I was diagnosed with PMDD.
"Since being diagnosed with PMDD, I've felt like a completely different person."
"The impact of PMDD has been profound, altering my daily life significantly."
"I've struggled with PMDD for years, and it's completely changed how I experience my emotions."
It feels like my life is divided into two distinct parts: before PMDD and after.
"felt so fatigued/low energy and I’ve been going to the toilet a lot more (pooping), cramping before I go to the toilet and a sore head"
"I'm feeling really run down lately, like I have no energy, and I've been going to the bathroom a lot more, even having cramps before I go, and my head feels like it's going to explode."
"I'm exhausted, I'm going to the bathroom constantly, my stomach has been cramping, and my head just feels like it's going to split open."
"I'm so drained, I'm going to the bathroom every hour, my stomach is cramping before I go, and I have this terrible headache."
"I'm feeling so weak and tired, I've been having diarrhea and cramping, and I have this awful headache that won't go away."
"I'm feeling totally wiped out, I've been going to the bathroom a lot, my stomach is cramping, and I have a splitting headache."
I don’t know if brain fog is why it happened or if I was overtired from insomnia or fatigue... I am mortified and don’t know how I will ever forgive myself for this.
"I'm so embarrassed, I can't even look at myself in the mirror."
"I feel like I let everyone down, and I don't know how to make it up to them."
"I'm completely devastated by what happened, and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forget it."
This whole situation is making me feel so anxious and insecure.
I wish I could just rewind time and change everything.
"i’m in a lot of pain today in my legs, back and head and overall feel like a burden ... i was almost nonverbal from working today and masking"
"I'm feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, my body is aching everywhere, and I feel like I'm just dragging everyone down."
"My legs, back, and head are killing me, I'm completely drained, and I barely managed to get through work today."
"I'm so physically and mentally drained, it's hard to even speak. I feel like a weight on everyone's shoulders."
"Everything hurts, my body is shutting down, and I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone around me."
"I'm in so much pain and my energy is completely depleted, I feel like I can't even function properly."
"feeling super depressed and want to shut my brain off... seek any dopamine hit I can get, but sometimes absolutely nothing works. My shopping & porn addiction are also wild during this time... I watch a lot of porn when I’m in a bad place mentally & I seek out the worst type of (sexual) attention."
"I'm in a really bad mood and just want to escape from my thoughts. I try to find anything that will make me feel better, but nothing seems to work."
"When I'm depressed, I feel so hopeless that I turn to unhealthy habits like shopping and watching pornography. It's like I'm trying to numb the pain."
"I know it's not healthy, but when I'm feeling down, I find myself watching a lot of porn. It's like I'm trying to escape from my own mind."
I've been feeling really down lately and I'm finding it hard to control my impulses. I'm shopping and watching porn way too much and I'm seeking out attention from people I shouldn't.
"I feel so lost and alone right now. I'm turning to all the wrong things to try to feel better, but it's just making everything worse."
"I struggle with my appearance and have developed an eating disorder. ... I feel ugly and disgusting to the point I don’t want to leave the house. ... I use the things he’s told me about his past against myself, like how he’s had threesomes I repeatedly wonder how I could ever be good enough and why he wants to be with me when he could just have more of that. ... I cry picturing him doing these things and I get horrible mental movies. ... I feel sorry for him that he has to be with someone that looks like me because he is a very attractive man I know he could do better than me. ... I feel so depressed to the point I barely eat during it. ... "
I'm constantly comparing myself to other women and it's really affecting my self-esteem.
I worry that he'll find someone else who's more attractive and leave me.
I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough for him.
I feel so insecure about my body that I can't even look at myself in the mirror.
I'm so consumed by these thoughts that I can't focus on anything else.
"My dad has OCD with intrusive thoughts and had been speaking to me for awhile about how he feels and about things out of his control. ... that day he gave away all of his clothes , left his partner a note, and headed to the beach to do it."
"My dad's OCD with intrusive thoughts has been really difficult for him lately, and he's been opening up to me about how it makes him feel."
"He's been struggling with these obsessive thoughts and feels like he can't control them, it's been weighing heavily on him."
He's felt trapped by these thoughts for so long and I think he finally felt like he needed to do something drastic to escape them.
"It's heartbreaking to see him so lost in his own mind, he's trying to fight these thoughts, but they just keep coming back."
"He's scared of what these thoughts might make him do, he's trying his best to manage them, but it's a constant battle."
"feeling perpetually like in the 3d before my period stage, minus the anxiety. Easily angered, groggy, tired, nauseous, and irritable."
"I'm feeling like I'm constantly in that pre-period slump, but thankfully without the anxiety. I'm easily annoyed, sluggish, exhausted, queasy, and irritable."
"I feel like I'm stuck in the days leading up to my period, except for the anxious part. I'm getting agitated easily, feeling heavy, tired, nauseous, and grumpy."
"It's like I'm permanently in that pre-menstrual phase, minus the worry. Everything sets me off, I'm foggy-headed, weary, sick to my stomach, and short-tempered."
"I'm experiencing that pre-period feeling all the time, but thankfully, without the added stress. I'm easily angered, sluggish, drained, nauseous, and irritable."
"This constant feeling of being in the pre-period stage, minus the anxiety, is really getting to me. I'm easily angered, slow-moving, exhausted, nauseous, and cranky."
I've had dehabilitating symptoms of PMDD. I've been having MAJOR anxiety and panic attacks during your period. I only feel better after my period is over. I'm terrified cause this has only happened once so what if my symptoms don't go away after my period.
I'm so scared because I've never experienced this before. What if the anxiety and panic attacks don't stop?
This is the first time I've had such severe PMDD symptoms. I'm worried it won't go away.
"I feel completely helpless and overwhelmed during my period. The anxiety is so bad, I can barely function."
I'm desperate for a solution. I don't know how much longer I can live like this.
It's like my body is betraying me. I just want to feel normal again.
Like thoughts are going really fast and I have so many ideas and want to do all of them. I can't make sense of it.
I feel overwhelmed by all the ideas flooding my mind. It's like a whirlwind of creativity.
"My brain is racing with possibilities, but I can't seem to grasp them all at once."
"I have this constant stream of inspiration, but it's hard to make sense of it all."
"My mind is overflowing with thoughts and ideas, and I don't know where to start."
"There's so much I want to do, but I'm struggling to organize it all."
"I feel so zoned out. I was up puking with digestive issues at midnight and couldnt sleep. I have 6 days til my period, so its really hard for me right now. My brain doesnt work. I am not myself... I am so down. I cant imagine entertaining someone or having fucking sex."
I'm feeling so exhausted and drained. I just can't seem to focus on anything.
My body feels so heavy and sluggish. I just want to curl up and sleep.
Everything feels overwhelming right now. I'm just trying to get through the day.
I can't even think straight. My head is just a jumbled mess.
I feel so disconnected from myself. I'm just going through the motions.
I’m not familiar with using anti-depressants in this short term manner.
I'm not comfortable prescribing antidepressants for such a short period.
I don't have much experience with using antidepressants in this way.
I'm not sure if short-term use of antidepressants is the best course of action.
I'm not convinced that short-term antidepressants would be effective in this situation.
I'm hesitant to use antidepressants in this short-term context because I don't know how they would interact with your other medications.
"I am so uncomfortable, I want to cry. ... severely uncomfortable."
"I'm feeling so overwhelmed, I just want to disappear."
"This situation is so stressful, it's making me want to scream."
"Everything feels so heavy, I can't even breathe properly."
My heart is racing and I feel like I'm going to explode.
"I'm so frustrated, I could just break down and cry."
"The pressure i feel everyday to mask and pretend i am okay until i break entirely is so heavy i can not breathe. I suffer with chronic endometriosis pain, ADHD and PMDD. Some days my suicidal ideation of just not knowing how i will keeping going gets to be too much and i scare myself."
"The weight of hiding my struggles and pretending to be fine is suffocating, especially with the daily pain of endometriosis, ADHD, and PMDD."
"It's a constant battle to keep up appearances while battling chronic pain and mental health struggles, and sometimes it feels like I'm drowning."
"The pressure to put on a brave face every day, while dealing with endometriosis, ADHD, and PMDD, is incredibly taxing and often leaves me feeling overwhelmed."
"It's a constant struggle to mask my pain and pretend I'm okay when the reality is I'm fighting endometriosis, ADHD, and PMDD, and sometimes it feels like I'm going to break."
"The combination of endometriosis, ADHD, and PMDD, coupled with the pressure to appear strong, often pushes me to the brink of despair, and I'm scared of what might happen if I crack."
"I have a lump and pain in my right breast. I have an ultrasound for it on Wednesday. In the darkest parts of my mind, I hope it’s cancer so I can get out of this life. Or at least has some sort of physical reason for suffering so much."
"I'm going through a lot right now, and it feels like there's no end in sight."
"I'm so tired of being in pain, I just want it to stop."
"Maybe if something bad happened, it would be a reason for all this suffering."
"It's like my body is fighting against me, and I don't know how to make it stop."
"I just want to know what's wrong with me, even if it's something terrible."
SHUT THE FUCK UP IM GETTING LIFE CHANGING INJECTIONS YOU THINK I HAVENT TRIED EATING A SALAD?????
"Lütfen sus, bu iğneler hayatımı değiştirecek, salata yemeyi denedikten sonra buraya mı geldiğimi sanıyorsun?"
"Bu an için sessiz kalmalısın, şu an çok önemli bir işlem yapılıyor, salata yemeyi mi bekliyordun?"
"Bırak konuşmayı, şu an çok önemli bir şey yaşıyorum, salata yemeyi deneyip de bir işe yaramayınca mı buraya geldim sanıyorsun?"
"Lütfen sessiz ol, hayatımın değiştiği bir anda yaşıyorum, sen bana salata yemeyi mi tavsiye ediyorsun?"
"Sessiz olmam gerek, şu anda çok önemli bir tedavi görüyorum, salata yemekten başka çözüm bulamadın mı sanıyorsun?"
"When I have to take the progesterone...mood wise not so bad at first but like an actual living zombie, couldn’t function. Then the worst cramps ever, like my whole back was breaking. Now I’m at the end of luteal and actually feel like I’m losing my mind, it’s quite frightening."
"I'm on the progesterone and while the mood swings aren't too bad initially, it's like I turn into a walking dead person, completely unable to function."
"The progesterone makes me feel like a zombie, I'm so exhausted and unmotivated, it's hard to do anything."
"The worst part about the progesterone is the cramps, it's like my whole back is breaking in two."
"I'm in the luteal phase and I'm starting to feel really anxious, it's a terrifying feeling."
"I'm at the end of my luteal phase and I feel like I'm losing my mind, the anxiety is overwhelming."
I’m currently on my 4th day of my bleed and still very emotional today. I’m starting to realize it’s a game to him and he doesn’t respect my time or just me in general. I’m kinda pissed. Kinda sad.
"It's been a rough few days since my period started and I just feel so emotionally drained. He's playing games with me and it's frustrating, I don't feel respected by him at all."
"I'm still feeling very upset about everything that happened. It's obvious he doesn't care about me or my time, he just wants to play games. It's making me angry and sad."
"Four days into my period and I'm a wreck. It's clear he doesn't value me or my time, he just wants to manipulate the situation. I'm feeling a mix of anger and sadness."
"This is the fourth day of my period and I'm still a emotional mess.  I'm starting to see that he's just playing games with me, he doesn't respect me or my time. It's infuriating and heartbreaking."
It's been four days since my period started and I'm still struggling with my emotions. He's treating me like a game and it's so disrespectful.  I'm feeling angry and hurt.
"I’ve been experiencing the following symptoms the week before period: Acne, Hot flushes, Irritability, Severe bloating, Very swollen/tender breasts, Joint pain, Anger/short tempered, Extreme overthinking, Intrusive thoughts, Change in appetite, Tiredness/unmotivated, Anxiety, Sudden tearful/sadness, Helplessness, Extreme feeling of impending doom at night, Can’t stick to one task, Brain fog, Can’t think before speaking, Loneliness, Overeating. I get severe overthinking the week before my period that effects how I act/behave, making it hard to make friends and manage tasks at work as I’m constantly second guessing and regretting everything I say and do, I often get tearful about this during the week. Some people say that I display occasional behaviours of Bipolar disorder growing up but it’s never been investigated"
"I've been experiencing intense emotional swings and physical discomfort in the days leading up to my period, which makes me feel overwhelmed and self-conscious."
"The week before my period, I feel like a different person - irritable, anxious, and with a constant stream of negative thoughts."
"My premenstrual symptoms are so severe that they affect my relationships, my work, and my ability to function normally."
"I'm not sure if it's just PMS or something more serious, but these emotional and physical changes are taking a toll on my mental health."
"It's frustrating to feel like I have no control over my emotions and actions during this time, and I'm constantly worried about how others perceive me."
"cyclical extreme pms/pmdd. The past 3 months since I turned 40 it has been unbearable. Hives, nausea, cramps... depression, crying spells, paranoia and anger at any percieved slight is throwing me for a loop every month."
"My premenstrual symptoms have become cyclical and extreme since I turned 40, and it's been completely unbearable."
"The past three months have been a nightmare with intense PMS/PMDD symptoms, making it impossible to function."
"I'm experiencing a rollercoaster of physical and emotional symptoms every month, from hives and nausea to depression and paranoia."
"The anger and sensitivity I'm feeling during this time are completely out of control, making it hard to manage even simple tasks."
"It's like a constant battle against my body and emotions, and I'm exhausted from the constant struggle."
Going off birth control has me back in full blown depression and anxiety 2-4 months later.
"I was feeling so much better since I started taking birth control, but now that I stopped, I'm right back where I started."
"My anxiety and depression were completely gone while I was on birth control, but they've returned with a vengeance now that I'm off of it."
"The birth control was a great temporary fix for my mental health, but the side effects of going off of it have been devastating."
"I thought I was finally past my anxiety and depression, but going off birth control has brought it all back."
"I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for years, and I thought birth control had finally solved the problem, but I was wrong."
I go into a spiral. I'm looking for something to help me stop self sabotaging everything I ever care about. Every month my partner has to deal with my bullshit and I feel like he's getting sick of it and growing resentful. Every month I snap at work and want to quit and/or I get angry about something or say something I regret.
"I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of self-destruction, constantly ruining the things I care most about."
"It's like I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions, with highs and lows that leave me feeling exhausted and defeated."
"I'm at my wit's end, trying to break free from this pattern of self-sabotage that's causing so much pain."
"I'm tired of letting my insecurities and anxieties control my life, leading me down a path of self-destruction."
I need to find a way to stop this vicious cycle of self-sabotage before it completely ruins everything.
My CPTSD freeze response is activated to the max. Freeze response is my main so cue hella anxiety and dissociation. Like just trying to get into my body is triggering. I cant fucking stand the sensory overload 24/7. I could write more but im starting to dissociate heavily. I can't even text people or hold much of a convo even if I did wanna break outta this isolation.
"I'm completely frozen by my CPTSD, it's the worst I've ever felt.  My body's just shutting down, and I'm so anxious and dissociated, it's like I'm not even in my own body anymore."
"The sensory overload is unbearable, it's like I'm drowning in it. I can't even function normally, and I'm starting to feel really detached from everything."
"I can't even text people right now, I'm just too overwhelmed and dissociated. I'm trapped in this isolation, and I don't know how to get out."
"I'm starting to feel like I'm going to completely lose it, I can't handle this anymore. My body is just shutting down, and I'm losing control."
"I'm so overwhelmed with anxiety and dissociation, it's like I'm living in a nightmare. I just want to escape, but I can't, I'm trapped in this hell."
"I got diagnosed with pmdd 7 years ago... I’m still generally miserable... I’m not talking regular acne, I mean like, they aren’t even technically acne... I am exhausted... I hate this so much."
"I've been struggling with PMDD for years, and it feels like there's no end in sight."
This PMDD is really taking its toll on me. I'm constantly tired and my skin is a mess.
I just want to feel normal again. I'm so tired of dealing with these symptoms.
"My skin has been so bad lately, and it's just another reminder of this awful condition."
I hate that I have to live with this. It feels like my body is constantly working against me.
"there are so many of us who, logically, should probably be dead just by how often we’ve been suicidal or tried to die"
"We've all been through so much, it's a miracle we're even still here."
"Looking back on how many times I've felt like giving up, it's astonishing that I'm still alive."
"The fact that we're all still here, after everything we've been through, is a testament to our resilience."
"We've all faced our demons and come out the other side, it's a testament to our strength."
"It's almost ironic how many of us have lived through such dark times, and yet we're still here, breathing."
"I feel so so ugly, big, and gross. Just DISGUSTING! Just like I’m taking up too much space. ... Trying ten different hairstyles, and fifteen different outfits, just to feel ugly, disgusting, gross, and just all around angry at everything is so hard."
I'm feeling so unattractive and uncomfortable in my own skin.
"It feels like I'm taking up too much space, both physically and emotionally."
"I hate how I look, and I hate how I feel about it."
"I just want to disappear, to be invisible."
"I feel like I'm constantly trying to find a way to feel better about myself, but nothing seems to work."
"I'm legit traumatized by both my initial insertion 6 years ago and the replacement. I feel so embarrassed for crying out even though I know it's fine. I had chills and was sweating profusely. I threw up in the parking lot, came home and slept for two hours. I keep having flashbacks and want to curl up and cry because I feel so violated."
"I can't believe I'm still haunted by that whole experience, both the first time and the second. It was so painful and humiliating."
"It's like my body remembers every detail, the pain, the fear, even the smell. I feel completely violated."
"I know I should be over it by now, but I can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. It's like a bad dream that I can't wake up from."
"I hate the way my body reacts to even the thought of it. I just want to forget everything, but it feels like a part of me is stuck in that moment."
"I'm so ashamed of myself for being so weak, but it felt like I was losing control. I just wanted it to be over."
"I tortured myself for ages over breaking up with my first boyfriend (a combo of insecure and slightly fetishistic), but this one time when I felt an unimaginable amount of rage when he was calling me incessantly, The dam broke and I broke up with him the next morning."
"I replayed that fight in my head for days, wondering if I was right to walk away, even though I knew deep down I had to."
"I felt so guilty for a long time, thinking I was a terrible person for leaving him, even though he was the one who hurt me."
"I convinced myself he was the one, that I couldn't live without him, but when he crossed that line, I knew it was over."
"I stayed in that relationship for so long, afraid of hurting him, but when he pushed me too far, I realized I had to protect myself."
"I felt like I was betraying everything I believed in by leaving him, but I knew I couldn't stay in a relationship that made me feel so small."
It feels almost impossible to get anything done. All I can manage to do is scroll mindlessly on my phone or stare at the wall.
"I'm completely paralyzed by procrastination, I can't seem to focus on anything."
"I feel so overwhelmed, even the simplest tasks feel impossible to tackle."
"My brain feels like it's in a fog, I can't even muster the energy to get up and do something productive."
"I'm stuck in this endless loop of inaction, it's like I'm frozen in place."
"All I can manage is to distract myself with meaningless activities, I'm completely avoiding facing my responsibilities."
"I feel insane. I got so upset yesterday that I couldn’t eat and then my digestion was a wreck today. It amplifies all my insecurities and complaints by a million now. I very nearly called off my relationship last night, even though I am normally happy and the relationship is healthy. It was all because of my PMDD has gotten so much worse. I always have those intrusive thoughts but this time, I couldn’t contain them and was just sobbing."
I'm convinced I'm going crazy. Everything feels so overwhelming right now.
"I was an absolute mess yesterday, and today my body is just not cooperating."
"My PMDD is making me feel incredibly vulnerable and insecure, and I'm struggling to cope."
"I'm normally so happy in my relationship, but last night I was ready to throw it all away."
"I feel like my emotions are completely out of control, and I can't seem to stop the negative thoughts."
"I felt so deeply depressed, anxious, and irritated for maybe a day or two at a time.  Sometimes as long as a week. ... I felt like one of those cartoons when a character would be so angry that steam was coming out of their head.  I was screaming at my mother. ... I didn't care that the depression felt so deep and even the anger I would experience would send me to the point where I would break things and come close to hurting myself. ... I felt so fucking angry.  I felt invalidated."
I felt completely overwhelmed and unable to cope with the intensity of my emotions.
The anger and frustration would build up inside me until it felt like it was going to explode.
My depression was so intense that it made me feel completely numb and disconnected from the world.
"I would lash out at anyone who tried to help me, pushing them away with my anger."
"I felt like I was trapped in a cycle of negativity and despair, with no way out."
mood swing (“but you were so happy and feeling so well yesterday”) and even my face looks different
"Yesterday, you were so joyful and energetic, but now you seem completely different."
I can't believe how quickly your mood changed - you were so positive yesterday!
"The change in your demeanor is startling; yesterday, you were radiating happiness, and now you appear so down."
"I'm shocked by the sudden shift in your energy; you were so full of life yesterday, and now your face even looks different."
"It's almost like you're a different person; yesterday, you were so upbeat, and today you seem so somber."
"I would just get insane mood swings and not in the normal teenage way. In the I wanna d!e I’m so annoying way. Now my symptoms seem to manifest as me just being completely on edge for 10 days and it’s so exhausting. I wake up stressed, anxious, and depressed and can’t figure out why then just DWELL on it."
"My mood swings were so extreme, they weren't just normal teenage drama, they were crippling and scary."
"I felt like I was going to explode with frustration and anger, and I didn't even know why."
"The constant anxiety and depression were a heavy weight I carried around every day, and I couldn't shake it off."
"It was like a switch flipped in my brain, and I went from feeling normal to being completely overwhelmed with negativity."
"I just couldn't get a handle on my emotions, and the whole experience was leaving me drained and exhausted."
"I lost my period for almost two years. i just got my period back and it's being so strange. i am 18 now, and i just started again today. this is the third time this month."
"I'm really confused about what's going on with my body. I thought I was done with periods, but now they're back, and they're totally different."
"I'm worried that something is wrong. I haven't had a period for so long, and now it's coming back so irregularly."
"I'm glad to have my period back, but I wish it would be more regular. This constant fluctuation is so frustrating."
My body is freaking me out. It's like my hormones are playing tricks on me.
I'm hoping this gets back to normal soon. I don't want to be dealing with this all the time.
I was just so down and out and ready to JUMP... now i feel so bad about how dramatic i was being when I probably just needed to take better care of me
"I was feeling so lost and hopeless, but now I feel silly for overreacting."
"I was so stressed and overwhelmed, I felt like I was going to lose it, but now I realize I just needed to take a step back."
"I was at my wit's end, ready to give up, but now I see that I just needed to take better care of myself."
"I was so down in the dumps, I was ready to throw in the towel, but now I realize I was just being dramatic."
"I was feeling so defeated, I was ready to give up on everything, but now I know I just needed to take some time for myself."
Having trouble convincing myself that the negative thoughts and feelings I have really aren’t real... I’m having a hard time staying positive and not displacing anger onto myself and my partner
"I'm struggling to push away these negative thoughts and feelings, they feel so real."
It's hard to be positive when I'm wrestling with these inner demons.
"I'm feeling so down, I just want to lash out at myself and everyone around me."
"I can't shake this negativity, it's taking over my whole being."
I'm trying to stay strong but these dark thoughts are pulling me down.
I hate myself. I have 0 good reasons to keep going. I destroy every place I live. I need fucking help
"I'm a mess, and I don't know how to fix it."
I feel like I'm just hurting everyone around me.
"I'm tired of being this way, but I don't know how to change."
"I'm so lost, and I don't see a way out."
"I'm drowning, and no one can hear my cries for help."
I always have this period where I think that society should accommodate me with my disorder as it is instead of me having to change. But the fact of the matter is that being a hermit for two weeks out of the month and expressing rage are not things that combine well with normal society.
"It's frustrating feeling like I need to constantly adapt to the world instead of the world adapting to me, but I know that being a recluse and prone to anger isn't exactly compatible with mainstream living."
"I wish society was more understanding of my condition, but I realize that being withdrawn and easily angered isn't exactly a recipe for social success."
"It's tough to reconcile the need for accommodation with the reality of how my condition affects my behavior, especially with things like needing to isolate myself and experiencing bursts of anger."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting against the way things are, trying to make the world fit my needs instead of fitting into the world, but I know that things like my need to withdraw and my occasional anger outbursts make it difficult to integrate."
"It would be nice if society was more accepting of my limitations, but I can't deny that being a hermit for a significant portion of the month and having a quick temper make it hard to function in a normal social setting."
"I have struggled with PMDD, the worst my naturopath claims to see. Tried western medicine, birth control, got offered every anti depressant in the books. Tried natural remedies, cod liver oil, evening primrose, vitex. Had a reaction to them all as I have a hard time regulating progesterone. It was to the point of talking myself out of crazy things on my period, affecting life, so on."
"I've gone through a lot with PMDD, it's been truly debilitating."
"I've tried everything under the sun for PMDD, western medicine, natural remedies, you name it."
The worst part about PMDD is the mental fog and the impulsivity it brings.
"I'm constantly battling this hormonal imbalance, it's like a rollercoaster ride."
"I've been through so many different treatments, but nothing seems to work long-term."
"10 days before my period my symptoms will start. Intense mood instability, increased anxiety, extisental dread, irritability, rage, exhaustion, etc"
My period symptoms start a full 10 days before I actually get my period.
"The week before my period, I'm basically a walking, talking mess of hormones."
"I'm starting to feel the premenstrual symptoms already, and it's still 10 days away from my period."
"The 10 days leading up to my period are the worst, with intense mood swings and extreme exhaustion."
"I can feel the hormonal roller coaster coming on, the symptoms start 10 days before my period."
"I feel like I’m at the end of my rope, rock bottom with pmdd. I lost my relationship largely due to pmdd. It’s been four months of terror and this round of pmdd feels worst of all. I keep missing work, and having crying spells that are so deeply painful.. I can’t shake the strong suicidal desire.. I’m completely alone without a support group.. and don’t know what to do."
I'm completely overwhelmed and feel like I'm drowning in this pmdd episode.
"The emotional pain is so intense, it's making it impossible to function."
I'm terrified that I'm going to lose everything because of this.
I feel like I'm falling apart and I don't know how to stop it.
It feels like I'm living in a nightmare and I can't wake up.
sobbing on the floor of my bathroom last night trying to explain to my partner that I actually love my life and don’t want to die but my brain tells me otherwise
"I was in the bathroom last night, crying my eyes out, trying to explain to my partner that even though I feel so bad, I actually love my life."
"My brain is telling me I want to die, but that's not true! I love my life, I just don't know how to cope with everything right now."
"I was on the bathroom floor last night, sobbing and trying to convince my partner that I don't want to die, even though my brain is making me feel like I do."
"My partner must think I'm crazy. I'm crying and telling them I love my life, but my brain is trying to convince me otherwise."
"I'm trying to fight the negative thoughts, but it's hard. Last night, I was on the bathroom floor crying, telling my partner that I actually love my life."
I always think it's my body trying to kill me.
I feel like my body is constantly working against me.
It's like my body is trying to sabotage my own health.
I can't shake the feeling that my body is trying to do me in.
I swear my body is trying to find any excuse to shut down.
I feel like my body is constantly battling me for control.
the darkness that takes over like the flip of a switch. Doing this month after month is beyond exhausting. I’ll be 35 this year and have two daughters ages 5 and 1 and I pray I don’t pass this down to them. Masking this from them the best I can every single month takes so much out of me.
"The exhaustion is like a dark cloud that descends, suffocating me with every passing month."
"It feels like the fatigue takes hold of me instantly, as if a switch is flipped."
This relentless cycle of exhaustion is wearing me down to the bone.
"I wouldn't wish this kind of exhaustion on anyone, especially not my daughters."
"The effort I put into hiding this from my children is draining me, both physically and emotionally."
It's so tiring.
I'm completely exhausted.
I feel drained and worn out.
This is so much work.
I just need to rest.
I'm ready to give up.
it's so hard 😭😭😭
It's just so incredibly difficult.
"I'm finding this really, really tough."
This is making me want to cry.
I feel like I'm going to break down.
This is seriously overwhelming.
"I've been going through severe depression since I hit menopause, on and off, in spite of taking medicine for it."
"Menopozdan sonra, ilaç kullanmama rağmen, sürekli olarak şiddetli depresyon dönemleri yaşıyorum."
İlaç kullanıyorum ama menopozdan beri şiddetli depresyon atakları yaşıyorum.
"Menopozdan sonra depresyonla mücadele ediyorum, ilaç kullanıyorum ama yine de zor zamanlar geçiriyorum."
İlaç kullanmama rağmen menopozdan bu yana sürekli depresyonla boğuşuyorum.
"Menopozdan sonra depresyon geçiriyorum, ilaç kullanıyorum ama etkisi kısa sürüyor."
I feel like I’m failing them a lot.
I'm constantly letting them down.
I'm not doing enough for them.
I'm not living up to their expectations.
I feel like I'm not making them proud.
I'm worried that I'm not meeting their needs.
infuriating is the suicide hotline popping up all over when you just want the goddamn question answered
The suicide hotline popping up constantly is driving me insane when I just want to get a clear answer.
It's so frustrating that the suicide hotline keeps appearing when I'm just trying to find a straightforward solution.
I'm absolutely livid that the suicide hotline keeps showing up when I simply want the question answered.
I can't stand how the suicide hotline keeps popping up when I'm just looking for a goddamn answer.
It's infuriating that the suicide hotline keeps appearing when all I want is a clear and concise answer.
"I was diagnosed with bipolar, but after studying and tracking my 'episodes' for years my provider added a diagnosis of PMDD. I'm freaking tired of doing this every month. It's exhausting."
I'm starting to feel like my mental health is a constant uphill battle.
It's really hard to feel like I have any control over my own emotions.
"I just want to feel like myself again, without the rollercoaster of ups and downs."
It's like my body is fighting against me every month.
I feel like I'm constantly trying to catch up with my own mind.
I’m paralyzed with confusion and rage. I’m so fucking mad at everything right now
"I'm so frustrated and angry, I feel completely stuck."
I'm in a state of total disbelief and fury.
"My mind is racing with anger and confusion, I can't think straight."
"This is just so unfair, I'm furious and completely lost."
"I'm completely overwhelmed by rage and frustration, I feel helpless."
I've been knocked out all week with exhaustion...luteal and depression combined in a sleepy sad beast...can't go to the gym much less work efficiently when I feel like this.
"I'm so tired and depressed, I haven't been able to function all week."
"My exhaustion and sadness have been so intense, I can barely manage basic tasks."
"Between the luteal phase and depression, I've been feeling like a zombie all week."
It's hard to even think about going to the gym when I'm this drained.
This combination of exhaustion and sadness makes it impossible for me to focus on anything.
"I wouldn’t shower, wash my body or wash my hair. I had very little energy to do any of that. ... I haven’t felt that depressed and done with life in SO LONG. ... I feel like a burden towards people for even talking about it. ... I’m tired of feeling so depressed and unwanted, etc. for two weeks before my period, ALONE."
I just want to curl up in bed and disappear for the next two weeks.
"The fatigue is so overwhelming, I can barely muster the energy to get out of bed."
"I feel like a completely different person during this time, like my body is betraying me."
"It's not fair that I have to go through this every month, feeling like I'm losing myself."
"I just wish I could skip this whole thing, the pain, the mood swings, the complete lack of motivation."
I eat and eat and eat without feeling satisfied. So I binge. On everything and everything... I eat because I’m depressed. I eat because I don’t see gym or eating healthy progress right away. I’m stuck in this never ending cycle and I need help.
I feel like I’m trapped in a cycle of unhealthy eating habits and I’m desperate for a way out.
"I'm constantly craving food, but it never seems to satisfy me. I just keep eating and eating."
"I eat because I’m sad, I eat because I’m bored, I eat because I’m stressed. It’s a vicious cycle."
"I feel like I'm addicted to food. I can't stop eating, even when I know it's bad for me."
I need help breaking free from this unhealthy pattern. I know I can't keep living like this.
"It starts off slow, creeping in barely noticeable. It starts with minor irritations and frustrations. But as the days get closer to my period the fog gets heavier and thicker. This looks like my rage and tears and exhaustion getting worse. I drop things and can't find words. ... My world feels like it's crumbling out from underneath me. My body doesn't work right and I drop things and bump into things."
"The initial stages are subtle, almost imperceptible, like a creeping fog. It begins with small annoyances and frustrations."
"It starts with minor inconveniences, like a slow-burning fuse, but as the day approaches, the frustration intensifies."
"The fog starts to roll in gradually, barely noticeable at first, but it intensifies as the days pass."
"The initial signs are subtle, like a whisper in the wind, but it builds into a raging storm."
"It's a gradual descent, a slow build-up of tension, like a pressure cooker reaching its boiling point."
I'll feel super intense emotions which are not connected to reality... I'll feel the same amount of anxiety I would if someone was chasing me with a chainsaw but in actual fact I'll just be sat on the train to work. Or I'll be hanging out with my family but I'll feel so sad as if everyone I know had just died. In my head I know it's not real but it feels so incredibly real that it really gets in the way of life. Also it's very tiring trying to control these emotions so although I can keep them a bay for a bit I often end up getting exhausted and that's when I might end up crying etc.
"These emotions feel so real, like a physical sensation, even though I know they aren't connected to anything happening in the real world."
"It's like my mind is playing tricks on me, creating these intense feelings that have no basis in reality."
"I can feel myself panicking as if someone is chasing me, but I'm just sitting on the train, completely safe."
"It's a constant battle trying to manage these emotions, and it takes so much energy just to keep them under control."
"It's frustrating because I know these feelings are irrational, but they feel so real that they can be overwhelming."
"In PMDD, your brain chemistry is the thing that is compromised, so using your best judgment isn’t always an option"
"PMDD'de, beyin kimyanız etkileniyor ve bu yüzden en iyi yargınızı kullanmak her zaman mümkün olmuyor."
"PMDD'nin sebep olduğu hormonal dalgalanmalar, mantıklı düşünmenizi zorlaştırabilir."
"PMDD, beyin kimyanız üzerinde önemli bir etkisi olan bir durumdur ve bu yüzden duygularınızı kontrol etmeniz zorlaşabilir."
"PMDD'de hissettiğiniz yoğun duygular, sizin normalde sahip olduğunuz mantık ve yargı yeteneğinizi etkileyebilir."
"PMDD'nin, ruh halinizi ve davranışlarınızı etkileyen bir beyin kimyası bozukluğu olduğunu unutmamak önemlidir."
"During my PMDD weeks, I can't use my logic to trust what I'm thinking. The logic part fails for me. I can't remember words or what I said or thought. So even if I know it's just PMDD, I can't trust my thoughts. My irritations and feelings are always valid, even during PMDD, it's my reactions to these feelings that are over reaction."
"During PMDD, I feel like my brain is playing tricks on me, and I can't rely on my usual reasoning skills."
"It's frustrating because I know my thoughts are distorted by PMDD, but I can't help but get caught up in them."
"My memory goes haywire during PMDD, and I can't even remember simple things, like what I said or thought just minutes ago."
The emotional intensity of PMDD makes it hard to distinguish between what's real and what's exaggerated.
"Even though I know my reactions are amplified by PMDD, it doesn't make them any less valid. I need to acknowledge my feelings but try to manage them in a healthy way."
"feel like you can’t trust your own brain. suicidal thoughts, endless frustration"
"I feel so lost, like my own mind is betraying me."
"It's like my brain is playing tricks on me, and I can't escape the negative thoughts."
"I'm constantly battling these dark thoughts, and it feels like I'm losing control."
"The frustration is overwhelming, and I just want to make it all stop."
"I feel trapped in my own head, and I don't know how to get out."
I've still cried every single day. And it's been harder to parse out my thoughts. Is my partner really acting distant or am I just interpreting negative things from neutral interactions? I can trust my instincts less.
I'm struggling to tell if my partner's behavior is intentional or if I'm overthinking things.
It's hard to know if I'm overreacting or if my partner is actually pulling away.
"My gut feeling is telling me something's wrong, but I'm not sure if I'm imagining it."
I'm second-guessing everything I'm seeing and feeling.
It's so confusing because I'm not sure what's real and what's in my head.
"knowing your life is not intensely sad and hopeless, that your hormones are to blame, does not keep you from feeling sad and hopeless"
Understanding that your sadness and hopelessness are due to hormonal fluctuations doesn't magically erase those feelings.
"Even if you know intellectually that your sadness is temporary, it doesn't make it any less real or painful."
Recognizing that your emotions are influenced by your hormones doesn't diminish the intensity of your feelings of sadness and despair.
Knowing that your sadness is hormonal doesn't stop you from experiencing the full weight of those feelings.
Just because you understand the biological basis for your sadness doesn't mean you can just switch off those feelings.
I thought my boyfriend was planning to kill me in the woods while on a hike in luteal. There is much less room for logic at the worst of pmdd.
"My hormones were raging and I started to think he was going to hurt me, I know it sounds crazy."
"I was feeling so irrational, it was like my mind was playing tricks on me."
"My emotions were so intense, it felt like I was going to lose control."
"I was terrified, I felt like I was in a horror movie."
"I don't know what came over me, but I started to have these crazy thoughts."
"I would believe that my good friend would murder me or be convinced that I’d be abducted by aliens or that my boss was really a cockroach in disguise planning for a nuclear war. It sounds so crazy, but when I was in that state, I couldn’t make sense of any of it."
I was so paranoid that I thought my roommate was a secret agent trying to steal my identity.
"It was like I was living in a bad dream, where everything felt distorted and nothing made sense."
The anxiety was so overwhelming that I started to think my family was plotting against me.
"I couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t, like my brain was playing tricks on me."
"I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, and I couldn’t wake up from it."
"mood swings, irritability, anger, depression stemming from hormones... my brain goes into short circuit mode... the feeling of hopelessness..."
"Hormonal changes have me feeling like a roller coaster of emotions, from highs to lows, and everything in between."
"It's like my brain is on fire, with bursts of anger, then sadness, then frustration, all because of my hormones."
"I can't seem to shake the feeling that nothing is going to get better, that this is just how I'm going to feel forever."
"The constant fluctuations in my mood are making it hard to function, I just want to crawl under the covers and hide."
"I feel like I'm losing control, my emotions are taking over, and I can't seem to find a way to ground myself."
"I KNOW my prolonged crying is because of my hormones but somehow that just doesn’t mean I can stop it... And the knowledge that it’s exacerbated by my hormones to this giant overreaction just makes it worse. Because I’m berating myself thinking why the fuck can’t I just shut this off?... And then I think, how can I survive in this world when I’m so sensitive? And the crying continues because I think life will always be this hard."
"I know this feeling of sadness is temporary, but it feels like it'll last forever. It's like my brain is playing tricks on me, making me feel so overwhelmed."
"I feel so helpless right now, like I can't control my emotions. I just want to feel normal again, but I don't know how."
"I hate that I can't just snap out of this. I feel like I'm drowning in my own feelings, and I don't know how to swim."
"It feels like everything is too much right now. I wish I could just turn off my emotions, but I know that's impossible."
"I'm so tired of feeling like this. I just want to be happy, but it feels like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity."
it's like my in-laws saying my child isn't logical when he's literally having a panic attack.
It's like they're blaming him for being overwhelmed.
They act as if his emotional distress is some kind of personal failing.
They don't understand the reality of his situation.
They're completely ignoring the emotional turmoil he's going through.
They seem to think he's just being dramatic.
I will be consumed by thinking about the itch. I am irritable... I experience extreme suicidal ideation. I’ve never attempted but I’ve dealt with this all my life. Recognizing that it will pass doesn’t eliminate the feeling.
"The itch is driving me crazy. I'm so agitated, I can't even think straight. It's like my mind is consumed by this overwhelming urge to scratch."
"I feel like I'm going to explode. This itch is making me so irritable, I can't even stand to be around people. I just want to scream."
"My thoughts are racing, and I'm constantly thinking about this itch. It's all I can focus on, and it's driving me to the edge. I've never felt this desperate before."
"I can't seem to escape this feeling of frustration and despair. The itch is making me so miserable, I can't even see the point of going on."
"I know it will eventually pass, but right now, I just feel like I'm drowning. This itch is consuming me, and I feel like I'm losing control."
it’s happening but it unfortunately doesn’t make it any easier
"It's happening, but the reality of the situation isn't making things any simpler."
"I know it's happening, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still a difficult situation."
"It's a reality we have to face, but it's not making things any less challenging."
"It's a process that's unfolding, but unfortunately it's not making it any less painful."
"Things are changing, but the truth is, it doesn't make it any easier to handle."
we are forced to endure bodily and THEN the emotions come out
"We are forced to bear the physical pain, and THEN the emotional distress follows."
"The body takes the initial hit, and THEN the feelings explode."
"First the physical suffering, and THEN the emotional storm erupts."
You can only take so much physical pain before the emotions start to pour out.
The physical discomfort forces us to confront the emotional turmoil that lies beneath.
"Physical feelings and mental/emotional perceptions/feelings are not easily compared... know that the paranoia, rejection, anger, whatever could be influenced by PMDD status but that wouldn’t take the feeling away, and those feelings can be powerful."
"Fiziksel duygular ve ruhsal/duygusal algılamalar/duygular kolay kolay karşılaştırılamaz... paranoyan, reddedilme, öfke, her neyse PMDD durumundan etkilenebilir ama bu duyguyu ortadan kaldırmaz ve bu duygular çok güçlü olabilir."
"Bedensel duyumlar ile zihinsel ve duygusal algılamalar kolay kolay ölçülemez, özellikle PMDD durumunda. Paranoya, reddedilme, öfke gibi duygular bu durumdan etkilense de, bu duygular gerçek ve güçlüdür."
"Fiziksel hisler ve zihinsel/duygusal algılamalar farklı boyutlarda olduğundan karşılaştırılması zor. PMDD durumunun paranoya, reddedilme, öfke gibi duygulara etkisi olsa da, bu duyguların kendilerini ortadan kaldırması mümkün değil, hatta çok güçlü olabilirler."
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal duygular arasında kesin bir bağlantı kurmak zor. PMDD durumu, paranoya, reddedilme, öfke gibi duyguları etkileyebilir ancak bunlar tamamen ortadan kalkmaz ve çok güçlü olabilirler."
"Bedensel rahatsızlıklar ile zihinsel ve duygusal algılamalar aynı ölçekte ölçülemez. PMDD durumu nedeniyle ortaya çıkan paranoya, reddedilme, öfke gibi duygular, kişinin gerçekte hissettiği duyguları tamamen yok edemez ve bu duygular çok yoğun olabilir."
It's going to work and dealing with shitty coworkers and customers. Gotta work or you will be hungry and homeless. It is interacting with your family and loved ones. It's not healthy to shut everyone out and it isn't appropriate to expect everyone else to walk on eggshells just for you. It's getting overstimulated going to the grocery store and you can't not eat and running out of TP isn't an option.
Life is a mix of the mundane and the stressful. You have to deal with unpleasant situations at work and in your personal life.
"It's about navigating the challenges of daily life, from dealing with difficult people to managing your own needs and emotions."
"Life involves a constant struggle to balance work, relationships, and personal well-being."
"It's a constant push and pull between what you want and what you have to do, and finding a way to make it all work."
"You have to find a way to cope with the ups and downs, the good and the bad, and make the best of it."
You're more likely to have alexithymia.. which could explain why it's hard for you to understand how changing your actions/thoughts may not change your interoceptive sense of stress. You may not be able to sense your own stress response as well many people.
"You might have alexithymia, which could explain why you're having trouble connecting the dots between your actions and how you feel physically."
It could be that your alexithymia is making it hard to understand how your thoughts and behavior affect your body's stress response.
Your alexithymia might be contributing to your difficulty in recognizing and understanding your own physical reactions to stress.
Having alexithymia could be why you're finding it difficult to grasp the link between your actions/thoughts and your internal sense of stress.
It's possible that your alexithymia is making it harder for you to identify and interpret your own body's signals of stress.
"I can recognize my feelings, yes, but that doesn't make them go away. Put simply, you have to ride the feelings out until the chemicals stop coming. Even if I know I'm angry over nothing, it's still very hard to not be angry. There will be literally no reason and the feeling just won't go away. Same with depression. The normal/ happy chemicals just don't come no matter what you do. Nothing is tested but your endurance."
"Even if I'm aware of my sadness, it doesn't mean I can simply erase it. It's like a wave you have to ride until it crashes and dissipates."
"It's frustrating to feel anxiety even when I know there's no logical reason for it.  It's like my brain is stuck in a loop of fear, regardless of what I tell myself."
"I can't just force myself to be happy. Sometimes, the chemicals just aren't there, no matter how much I try to shift my perspective."
"It's a constant battle with myself to not let my negative thoughts spiral. I can recognize the patterns, but they still have a strong hold on me."
"I'm constantly reminded that happiness isn't a choice, but a byproduct of the right chemical balance in my brain. It's a humbling realization."
"I’m stuck in a limbo of all of those feelings, constantly feeling not right/ on edge till something triggers me then one or more of the responses goes into overdrive. The worst part about it is I don’t know what will set me off, how long it will last and how severe it will be. For example my rational brain knows not to cry over spilled milk. My PMDD brain will spiral into thinking I don’t deserve to live because I wasted precious food that people work really hard for and some can’t even afford the luxury of fresh milk."
"I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, always on edge, waiting for the next trigger to send me spiraling."
"It's like I'm living in a constant state of anticipation, never knowing what will set me off or how intense the reaction will be."
"I'm trapped in a cycle of unpredictable emotions, and it's exhausting trying to predict the next outburst."

"it doesn’t help the symptoms or fear at all. It’s “temporary” despite it coming every month but I still feel that same sadness that I’m gonna have to go through it AGAIN next month. During the worst of it, it’s just “dear god please let this be over with”…"
"It's like a recurring nightmare, knowing that no matter what I do, I'll have to face it again next month."
The temporary relief doesn't erase the underlying fear and sadness. I know this cycle will continue.
"Even though it's a predictable pattern, it still feels like I'm trapped in a constant struggle."
"I feel like I'm stuck on a hamster wheel, going through the same emotional rollercoaster every month."
"It's a constant weight on my mind, knowing that the pain and fear will come back, and I'll have to endure it all over again."
"I tend to disassociate, feel brain foggy, and feel really on edge... feeling anxious and this led me to having full blown panic attack... Feeling brain foggy and disassociating and KNOWING it's happening but being unable to do anything makes me feel trapped."
"I feel like I'm losing control of my mind and body, and it's terrifying."
"It's like my brain is disconnected from everything else, and I can't think clearly."
The anxiety is so intense that I feel like I'm going to explode.
"I'm stuck in this cycle of fear and confusion, and I can't break free."
"I just want to feel normal again, but I don't know how."
"when the lymbic system is fired (the system responsible for emotions), the frontal lobe (responsible for cognition etc) shuts down and goes offline and it isn't until those emotions come back down again can you remember that ""oh yah, i know its pmdd, i probably overreacted""... then you have the people around you who might understand, but it still hurts them to be yelled at etc so now not only do you need to manage your own feelings but you need to manage the impact on them too and the guilt that follows you sometimes."
"The amygdala takes over, and all rational thought goes out the window, leaving me feeling like a completely different person."
"It's like my brain is on autopilot, and I can't control the emotional rollercoaster I'm riding."

"I feel like I'm in a fog, and it takes time for the fog to lift and for me to regain control of my emotions."
"I truly believe I'm insanely unhappy in my marriage and want a divorce, that my kids would be better off without me and that I have absolutely no one. I can know these are hormonal responses whilst also feel they're so strong there must be some truth to them."
"I feel so lost and alone, like I'm drowning in this marriage and can't find my way out."
"It's like a constant battle inside me, knowing I'm not thinking clearly but feeling so strongly that I need to make a change."
"I know I'm probably being irrational, but these feelings are so overwhelming that I can't ignore them."
"I'm so exhausted and empty, like a shell of the person I used to be, and I don't know how to get back."
"This marriage is suffocating me, and I feel like I'm losing myself, and I don't know how to find my way back."
It’s really difficult to get out of feelings of hopelessness... It’s uncontrolled. It’s exhausting. Even though you know the cause that knowledge does not equate to a cure.
"Feeling hopeless is like being trapped in a pit of despair, you can't escape, it drains all your energy, and even knowing the reason doesn't make it go away."
"It's a constant struggle to fight off the hopelessness, it feels like a runaway train, it saps all your strength, and understanding the cause doesn't magically fix it."
"Hopelessness feels like an endless abyss, it's overwhelming and uncontrollable, it leaves you emotionally drained, and even if you know what caused it, there's no easy solution."
"It's a crushing weight of despair that you can't shake off, it's like being lost in a fog, it exhausts you completely, and knowing the source doesn't change the feeling."
"Hopelessness is like a dark cloud that hangs over you, it's hard to break free, it takes all your energy away, and even with knowledge of the cause, it doesn't disappear."

"During the good times, I see the world in a brighter light, filled with possibilities... But even during the bad times, I maintain a sharp understanding of what's happening, even if it's a painful one."
"When things are going well, I feel a sense of peace and confidence... And when things are tough, I still have that same clarity, but it's tinged with a sense of negativity."
"Good weeks bring a sense of lightness and optimism... The bad ones bring a stark, clear understanding of the challenges, a reality just as powerful as the good times."
"During my productive phases, everything seems clear and bright... But even in the difficult periods, I have a strong grasp of what's happening, even if it's not a pleasant one."
"In the good times, I feel invigorated and optimistic... When things are tough, I feel a stark awareness of the situation, a clarity that's both challenging and real."
"For me, I usually know when I'm being irrational but that doesn't make it hurt any less...My PMDD is pretty self focused, although interactions with others can make it worse if it is unpleasant."
"I know when I'm being unreasonable due to my PMDD, but that doesn't mean it's any less painful."
"My PMDD tends to be inward-focused, but it definitely gets worse when dealing with unpleasant interactions."
"Even though I'm aware of my irrational behavior during PMDD, the emotional pain remains the same."
"My PMDD mostly affects me internally, but negative social interactions can amplify the symptoms."
"It's frustrating to know I'm acting irrationally during PMDD, but the emotional impact doesn't diminish."

"We can't help but cry sometimes, it's a natural reaction, like a hot flash that you can't stop."
"The act of crying is involuntary, like a hot flash, as someone said, we can't stop it."
"Just like a hot flash, crying is something that happens to us, we can't stop it."
"Crying is something we can't control, it's like a hot flash, we can't stop it from happening."
I *know* it's hormones (along with other factor) but that doesn't make the feelings *poof* go away.
"I understand it's a natural reaction, but that doesn't make it any easier to deal with."
"I know it's temporary, but it doesn't mean these emotions just disappear."
"I know it's part of the process, but I still feel overwhelmed."
"I know it's just a phase, but it feels so intense right now."
"I understand it's normal, but it's still tough to handle."

this condition causes me to want to kill myself on a regular basis
This condition makes me feel like I want to end my life regularly.
I'm constantly thinking about suicide because of this condition.
This situation is so unbearable that it makes me want to take my own life.
I feel like I can't go on anymore because of this condition.
I'm so desperate that I'm considering suicide as a way out.
"When my hormones start shifting, the feeling of a general uneasiness starts to take over. My brain starts looking for thoughts to match those feelings, anything to feed the fire... My brain WILL twist and delude things, because it needs to match that chemical feeling of chaos."
"The way my body feels when my hormones are out of whack is like a constant low-grade panic, and my thoughts start doing gymnastics to explain it."
"When I'm in that hormonal state, I feel completely off-kilter, and my brain gets caught in a loop, trying to make sense of the chaos."

I feel like shit for literally existing in this body of mine with all the fucked up things that are wrong with it.
I'm so tired of feeling like a burden to myself because of all my physical limitations.
"I hate how my body constantly betrays me, making me feel like a failure."
"It's such a struggle to exist in this flawed body, and it makes me feel worthless."
"I just want to be healthy and strong, but my body is constantly holding me back."
Sometimes I wish I could just escape this body and start fresh with a new one.
The experience of pmdd as a whole had been on the hardest things to describe.
The feeling of being overwhelmed by anxiety is one of the hardest things to explain.
Trying to articulate the feeling of being completely exhausted but unable to sleep is incredibly difficult.
Describing the physical pain and discomfort associated with endometriosis is nearly impossible.
The emotional rollercoaster of bipolar disorder is something I can barely put into words.
It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't experienced it just how debilitating chronic pain can be.
"the choking chesty feeling like someone close to you has just died. The rage for me (and occasional echolalia) is particularly bizarre, it's like someone else has control of my body. I really relate to the concept of demonic possession."
"It's an odd sensation, like your insides are being squeezed, almost like a grieving process for someone you've lost, but without the outward tears."
"The anger and the way I repeat things, like a broken record, it's so unlike me, it's as if I've been taken over."

"I don't know who I am anymore, I feel so lost, like a piece of me died when they did, and I'm just an empty shell."
"This feeling of being trapped inside my own body, it's like being a prisoner in my own mind, the only way out is to scream, but even that doesn't seem to work."
my body whole heartedly believes it... It’s a lot harder to sooth the body than to redirect the mind. I also have to check out of life intermittently to reign in the trainwreck(s)
It's much easier to tell myself to relax than it is to actually relax my body.
"The mind is a powerful thing, but it can't always control the body's response to stress."
I often find myself needing to take a break from everything just to get my body back in balance.
"My body sometimes seems to have a mind of its own, especially when it comes to anxiety."
I'm learning that taking care of my physical and mental health requires a conscious effort.
I sometimes think my bf is tampering with my meds when my PMDD gets bad.
I'm starting to think my bf is trying to sabotage my mental health when I'm at my worst.
It feels like he's intentionally making things worse when I'm struggling with my PMDD.
"He seems to get really weird when my PMDD kicks in, like he's trying to do something to me."
"I feel like he's taking advantage of me when I'm at my most vulnerable, when I'm dealing with PMDD."
"Sometimes I wonder if he's intentionally making my PMDD worse, like he's trying to control me."
"I often describe that my worst moments with PMDD dont even feel like *me*. I get insecurities and thoughts that I would never have on a normal day. I usually think my body looks pretty good, I never engage in negative self talk… but I vividly remember walking past a mirror and thinking to myself that I look disgusting and I’m worthless during an episode. It was so unlike me, its almost like normal me took over at the thought. But that quickly turned into me getting even more upset about how this condition is uncontrollable and ruining my life. Suicide has never been apart of my “worldview”…. but its SO prevalent during my PMDD episodes."
I feel like a completely different person during my PMDD episodes. It's like a dark cloud just takes over.
My PMDD makes me feel insecure and worthless in ways I would never normally feel.
"I have this overwhelming feeling of sadness and hopelessness during my PMDD, even though I normally don't feel that way."
"It's terrifying how quickly my mood can shift during PMDD. One minute I'm fine, the next I'm in a dark pit of despair."
My thoughts and emotions during PMDD episodes are so intense and foreign to me. It's like I'm not even in control of my own mind.
I tried explaining it to my parents and they thought I was making it up. It’s really hard to explain when common sense for a healthy person is so obvious.
"It's frustrating when people don't believe you, especially when it's something you know is true."
"I wish they could understand what I'm going through, but it seems like they just don't get it."
It feels like I'm speaking a different language when I try to explain it to them.
I'm tired of having to defend myself and prove that I'm not making things up.
"Maybe if I could just find the right words, they would finally understand."
"I no longer have highs and lows, I just get so bored. Nothing I used to love feels that interesting anymore. All I feel like doing is lying down."
"I'm so tired of the ups and downs, all I want is to be flatlined."
"Life used to be exciting, now it's just a blur of gray."
"I used to crave the rush, now I just crave peace, but even that's boring."
"The thrill is gone, all that's left is a dull ache."
"Everything feels the same, I'm just going through the motions."
"I got withdrawn from everyone and everything. I only pretended I was working and just slept entire days away. ... I get bad, real bad, ... My life and my mental health just falls apart every few weeks, and then it goes away and I’m fine."
"I feel completely disconnected from everyone and everything.  I just put on a show of working, but really I spend entire days sleeping."
"It's like I lose myself completely, like a switch is flipped and I just shut down."
"There are times when I can't even seem to function. It feels like my life is just falling apart, piece by piece."
I get so overwhelmed and exhausted that all I can do is retreat into myself and sleep for days on end.
"It's a cycle, really. I feel so good for a while, then suddenly I crash and everything falls apart again."
"I was prescribed Prozac about 10 years ago for PTSD/anxiety/depression. I quit taking it because my depression got worse, and my memory was noticeably getting much worse. Coming off the Prozac helped. My PMDD doesn't show up with every cycle, but when it does, it's horrible. It's been responsible for breakups, struggling at work, and my depression getting concerning."
"I've tried different antidepressants in the past, but nothing seems to work for me like it used to."
"I've had to learn how to manage my depression and anxiety without medication, but it's a constant struggle."
"Sometimes I wonder if there's something else I could be doing to feel better, but I don't know where to start."
"It's frustrating to feel like my body is working against me, especially when it comes to my mental health."
I hope one day I can find a solution that truly helps me feel like myself again.

feeling like their losing control... thinking weird thoughts like 'what if am I really not here?'... then I felt an over whelming need to cry.
"I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and out of control, like I'm losing my grip on reality."
"It feels like I'm spiraling, having these strange, intrusive thoughts, questioning my own existence."
"I'm experiencing a wave of anxiety and fear,  a sense of being completely detached from everything."
"The thought of not being real, of not existing, is so terrifying it makes me want to break down."
"I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack, my mind racing with doubts and insecurities."
"I feel like it would help me accept the condition instead of doubt my feelings and thoughts, thinking it’s not that serious and I’m just overreacting."
Accepting the condition would be easier than constantly questioning my emotions and minimizing the seriousness of the situation.
I think acknowledging the situation would be more beneficial than dismissing my feelings and thoughts as an overreaction.
It would be better to face the reality of the condition rather than doubting myself and thinking it's not that big of a deal.
"Instead of doubting my instincts and downplaying the severity, I believe accepting the condition would be more constructive."
I feel like accepting the condition would help me move forward rather than getting stuck in a loop of self-doubt and denial.
I am just so full of self-loathing right now. I get severe brain fog and migraines during my PMDD phase. I just had her in a shirt and panties the whole time. I really can't do this anymore. All my worst mistakes happen when I'm in the throes of PMDD.

My PMDD makes me feel like I'm losing my mind.

It's like I'm not even myself when I'm going through this.
"This is all just a giant mess, I don't know how to fix it."
"I've been giving into the impulsive thoughts and I'm getting worse and worse at not giving into the intrusive ones, I've been relapsing sh over it, I almost had a whole bottle of vitamins over it, wich wouldn't have kill-d me, but it would've been bad, and lately when I've been having pmdd rage and my cats get close to me, I just have to lock them out of my room or just get away from them because I'm scared I'll do something, I don't trust myself around sharp objects anymore, I always regret whatever I do after the episode so I know I shouldn't but it's so hard man, I feel like I'm getting to be more and more of a danger to myself and those around me, I'm honestly scared I'm gonna kill myself"

"Bunun üstesinden gelmem gerekiyor, anksiyete, kaygı dolu bağlanma biçimi, uykusuzluk, düzenli depresyon, kronik yorgunluk hep beni etkiliyor..."
"Bu hislerin sebepleri belli, anksiyete, kaygı dolu bağlanma biçimi, uykusuzluk, düzenli depresyon, kronik yorgunluk... Bunlarla baş etmem gerekiyor."
"Ne zaman mutlu olmaya çalışsam anksiyete, kaygı dolu bağlanma biçimi, uykusuzluk, düzenli depresyon, kronik yorgunluk gibi şeyler üzerime geliyor..."
I cannot trust my feelings of unease. I cannot trust my emotions. I cannot trust my composure. I cannot trust my patience. I cannot trust myself. I cannot trust the despair that will consume me.
I cannot trust the fear that will paralyze me.
I cannot trust the anger that will blind me.
I cannot trust the loneliness that will break me.
I cannot trust the exhaustion that will cripple me.
I cannot trust the doubt that will suffocate me.
Feeling pretty down and out. I was referred back in Feburary for investigations and discussions around possible surgical/hrt treatment. This was then expedited due to a really bad episode that landed me in the hospital and bed ridden for days after.
"I'm feeling really discouraged right now, especially after everything that's happened with the potential treatment."
"It's been a difficult few months, and I'm feeling exhausted and disheartened."
"The whole process has been so stressful, and I'm just feeling really low."
"I was hoping for some progress, but the recent setback has really knocked me back."
"I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard when I feel like I'm constantly facing hurdles."
"I am terrible for overextending myself and it helps to just say ‘no, I can’t’ to people during or leading up to luteal."
"I find it really hard to say no to people, especially during my luteal phase."
"I struggle with setting boundaries, particularly during my luteal phase, and it's best for me to say no."
"I'm not good at saying no to things, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed in the luteal phase."
"Saying 'no' is a struggle for me, especially during the luteal phase, but it's important for my wellbeing."
"I tend to overcommit myself, especially in the luteal phase, and it's essential that I learn to say no more often."
"Anything involving water - a bath, shower, or just watering plants with a hose and spraying my feet."
"I love anything that involves water, whether it's a relaxing bath, a refreshing shower, or simply watering the plants and getting my feet wet."
"There's something so soothing about water, whether I'm soaking in a tub, standing under a shower, or just using the hose to water my plants."
"I find myself drawn to water in any form - a bath, a shower, even just spraying the plants with the hose and getting my feet splashed."
"Water is so therapeutic, whether it's a luxurious bath, a quick shower, or simply the act of watering my plants and feeling the water on my feet."
"I love the feeling of water on my skin, whether it's a long bath, a quick shower, or just a little splash from the hose while I'm watering the plants."
I will end up cancelling them anyway! Not having the pressure of showing up and guilt of cancelling helps.
I'd rather just cancel now and avoid the whole guilt trip later.
"I'm sure I'll just end up bailing on them anyway, so what's the point in committing?"
Canceling now is way less stressful than feeling pressured to show up and then having to apologize later.
I'd rather just be honest and cancel now before I feel obligated to go.
"If I'm not really up for it, I'm better off just canceling now and avoiding the awkwardness."
eating myself silly but on things that aren’t going to result in stomach pain or the shame that comes from standing with the fridge door open eating butter with a spoon
"I'm trying to eat a lot, but I'm choosing foods that won't make me feel bad later."
"I'm indulging myself, but I'm being mindful of what I'm eating so I don't regret it later."
"I'm eating a lot, but I'm not going to eat anything that will give me a stomach ache or make me feel ashamed."
"I'm enjoying myself, but I'm not going to eat anything that will make me feel guilty."
"I'm trying to stay healthy while still enjoying myself, so I'm choosing my indulgences carefully."
I've found myself standing in the library crying during hell week because I can't choose a book and nothing interests me.
"I feel completely lost and overwhelmed with all the choices during midterms, even something as simple as picking a book feels impossible."
"I'm so stressed out with finals week that I just want to curl up in the library and cry, but even picking a book to read feels too hard."
"It's ironic, I'm surrounded by thousands of books, but I feel so empty and uninspired that I can't even choose one to read."
"This week has been so chaotic that I'm struggling to find any joy in the simple things, even picking out a book to read feels like a chore."
"I'm feeling so lost and disconnected right now that I can't even find something to read that resonates with me, even though I'm surrounded by countless possibilities."
struggling with getting outside when you really don’t feel like it but want to bc you know it helps you feel better
"I know I should get out, even when I'm feeling lazy, because it always makes me feel better in the end."
"The struggle is real when you're feeling unmotivated, but I know forcing myself outside is always worth it."
"Sometimes I just want to stay inside, but I remind myself that getting some fresh air will make me feel a lot better."
"It's hard to motivate myself to leave the house when I'm not feeling it, but I know the benefits of getting outside are worth the effort."
"Even though I'm not feeling up to it, I force myself to get outside because I know it'll make me feel less drained and more positive."
I’ve been very into Matt Haig for books that remind me it’s ok to be mentally unstable. He himself battles anxiety and depression and I find the way he writes about it incredibly relatable
"Matt Haig's books have been a lifeline for me, especially when it comes to feeling like it's okay to struggle with mental health."
"Reading Matt Haig makes me feel less alone in my struggles with anxiety and depression, his honesty is so refreshing."
"I love how Matt Haig normalizes mental health issues in his writing, it makes me feel less ashamed of my own experiences."
"Matt Haig's books are a reminder that mental health is a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to have ups and downs."
I'm so grateful for authors like Matt Haig who help us understand and accept our mental health struggles.
"I used to be very bad for it but once I realized it was something that helped, I just try to be firm with myself about it."
"I know I used to get really stressed about it, but after I understood how it was actually helpful, I just try to stay focused on it."
"I used to avoid it like the plague, but now that I see how important it is, I try to be disciplined about it."
"I was really against it before, but now that I see the benefits, I'm trying to be strict with myself about it."
"It used to be a real struggle for me, but now that I've seen the positive impact, I just try to stay consistent with it."
"I used to be really bad at it, but once I realized how much it improved my life, I just try to be strict with myself."
My PMDD brain tells me that I have to fix every problem RIGHT NOW (and it’s also telling me that everything is a problem)
"My PMDD brain is convinced that I need to solve everything immediately, even if it's not a real crisis."
"It feels like my PMDD brain is on overdrive, constantly scanning for issues to address, even if they're minor."
"I swear, my PMDD brain is a master at turning molehills into mountains, making every little thing seem like a huge problem."
"My PMDD brain has a tendency to catastrophize, turning everyday annoyances into monumental emergencies."
"It's like my PMDD brain is a hyperactive alarm system, constantly going off about things that are totally manageable."
I had to repeat to myself that this is a requirement for my wellbeing. Doing that shut my brain up long enough for me to make it outside.
"I kept telling myself that it was essential for my mental health, and only then could I finally get out the door."
"I had to convince myself that this was absolutely necessary for my well-being, and only then did my mind quiet down enough for me to leave the house."
"I had to repeat the mantra that this was vital for my well-being, and only then did I manage to shut off the noise in my head and get out."
"I had to remind myself over and over that this was crucial for my happiness, and only then could I push past the internal resistance and go outside."
"I had to keep telling myself that this was a necessity for my peace of mind, and only then was I able to silence the turmoil in my head and leave the house."
I'm mad at the people in my life right now for not caring and I'm mad at my parents for raising me with no coping skills ... I'm mad at the universe for making me fat and stupid and unemoployable and sensitive
"I feel like I'm being constantly let down by everyone around me, and I don't know how to deal with it."
"It's hard to feel like I'm failing at everything, and I just don't know how to fix it."
"I'm so frustrated that I'm struggling so much, and it feels like no one understands."
"Everything feels like it's against me, and I just feel lost and alone."
"I'm tired of being hurt and disappointed, and I don't know how to make it stop."
the ruminating thoughts that are accompanied with a desire to completely self sabotage. Specifically in my relationship. The way that I can convince myself that my thoughts are reality sometimes scare me to be honest. “my partner is cheating on me” ... “they hate me and just feel stuck with me and don’t wanna hurt my feelings by breaking up” ... *partner makes a new friend* “wow they’re definitely going to leave me at some point for this new person so maybe I should end things first so I can beat them to it”
"The constant worry and doubt that creep into my mind, especially when it comes to my relationship, can be so destructive."
"I have this awful habit of spiraling into negative thoughts about my relationship, and I convince myself they're true, which is terrifying."
"It's frightening how easily I can convince myself that my partner doesn't love me anymore, even when there's no evidence."
"I'm scared of the way I can talk myself into believing that my partner is going to leave me, even though it's probably not true."
"The thought of my partner finding someone else and leaving me makes me want to end things first, so I can somehow control the situation."
"I've been on daily zoloft since 2011 and it worked beautifully - until the last couple of months now that I'm undoubtedly in perimenopause. I'm already on 150 MG of zoloft, and I don't know that I can or even want to increase the dose. I can't deal with the mood swings and turning into the Rage Monster that has been kept at bay until recently!"
"I've been taking Zoloft daily for years, and it was great for managing my anxiety, but now that I'm going through menopause, it's just not enough."
"My Zoloft has been a lifesaver for my depression, but lately, these hormonal changes are making it almost impossible to cope."
"I'm on the maximum dose of Zoloft, and even that's barely holding the mood swings at bay. I can't imagine going higher."
"It's frustrating because my Zoloft has been so effective for so long, but now it's like it's barely working. I'm at my wit's end."
The rage I've been experiencing lately is unlike anything I've ever felt. I'm worried I'm going to lose control.
I feel so unmotivated I can’t do anything and I want to cry but I got no tears..
"I'm so drained, I can't even muster the energy to get out of bed."
Everything feels pointless and I just want to curl up and disappear.
"I'm completely empty inside, like there's nothing left to give."
"The weight of everything is crushing me, and I don't know how to cope."
"I'm just going through the motions, waiting for this feeling to pass."
I've long suspected he may have borderline personality disorder as we've talked about his issues
"I've been concerned about him for a while now, his behavior seems to fit the traits of borderline personality disorder."
"He's been struggling with some emotional instability, and I've wondered if he might have borderline personality disorder."
"We've discussed his difficulties, and I've considered the possibility of borderline personality disorder."
The way he reacts to situations makes me think he could have borderline personality disorder.
His emotional swings and intense relationships are consistent with what I know about borderline personality disorder.
it feels like it's crushing me some days...the cycle of rage > realize you over-reacted > give yourself grace > realize you can't do anything to shake off your mood > get depressed > repeat
"This emotional roller coaster is exhausting, I feel like I'm just going through the motions."
"It's a vicious cycle, I just keep going round and round, nowhere to escape."
"I can't catch a break, it feels like one bad feeling just leads to another."
"I'm trapped in this loop of negativity, and I don't know how to break free."
"It's like I'm stuck in quicksand, the more I struggle, the deeper I sink."
I've been noticing every month where my body gets so weak even after having vitamins and exercising 4 days a week. Mentally and physically feel exhausted about 1-2 weeks before my period.
"I've been noticing that my energy levels plummet every month, despite taking vitamins and exercising regularly."
"No matter how hard I try to stay healthy, I always feel completely drained a couple of weeks before my period."
"It's frustrating how weak I get every month, even with a healthy diet and exercise routine."
"I'm so exhausted both physically and mentally in the week or two leading up to my period, even though I'm taking care of myself."
"I feel like my body just shuts down for a week or two before my period, no matter how much I try to stay active and eat well."
"I supplement the lack of pharmaceuticals with a series of strange habits and obsessions that I do feel genuinely help... I find that when that time comes around, I constantly have him playing in the background, sometimes I barely even listen, but every once and a while he says something that completely snaps me out of the hormonal turmoil. Even if it's just for a few minutes. It really helps. He is a stern and optimistic voice. I feel like over time some of his principles have actually stuck into my brain, and I have effectively reworked some of my neural pathways."
"I've found that his words act as a kind of mental medicine, a soothing balm for my emotional ups and downs."
"He's like a steady anchor in the storm of my emotions, offering a grounded perspective that helps me navigate the choppy waters."
"His optimistic outlook is like a ray of sunshine piercing through the clouds of my hormonal turmoil, offering a brief respite from the darkness."
"It's like he's a part of my brain now, guiding my thoughts and shaping my reactions in a more positive and balanced way."
"His voice is a reminder that there's always hope, even when it feels like everything is falling apart, and that's a powerful thing."
"I’ve had the headache, the nausea, fatigue, everything today. I don’t want to go and be sad the whole time, nor do I want to get the ick from him for no apparent reason "
"I've been feeling so run-down all day, and the last thing I want is to spend the whole night feeling worse."
"I'm just not up for going out, I'm exhausted and feel like I'm coming down with something."
"It's not worth it to go and be miserable, especially when I'm already feeling so sick."
"I'm so tired and I don't want to get sick from being around him, so I'm going to stay home."
I'd rather just relax and try to feel better than go out and have a bad time.
can’t put someone through this every month anymore it’s not fair to them and it’s not fair to me
"I can't keep putting them through this financial hardship every month, it's just not right."
It's unfair to them and it's unfair to me to have to go through this financial struggle every single month.
"This monthly financial burden is taking a toll on both of us, and it's time to find a better solution."
"I can't keep putting them in this difficult financial position every month, it's just not sustainable."
"It's not fair to them to have to deal with this financial uncertainty every month, and it's not fair to me to have to watch them struggle."
a few month long depressive episode
Birkaç ay süren bir depresyon dönemi geçirdim.
"Uzun bir depresyon dönemi yaşadım, yaklaşık birkaç ay sürdü."
Son aylarda sürekli bir mutsuzluk ve umutsuzluk duygusu içindeydim.
Kendimi birkaç ay boyunca derin bir depresyonun içinde buldum.
"Birkaç ay süren bir depresyon dönemi atlattım, çok zorlu bir zamandı."
cannot sleep for the freaking life of me in my luteal phase
"I can't sleep at all during my luteal phase, it's driving me crazy."
"My luteal phase is the worst, I'm up all night tossing and turning."
"I'm so exhausted but I can't seem to fall asleep, it's like my body is fighting me during my luteal phase."
"I wish I could just sleep through my luteal phase, it's so uncomfortable."
"I'm so tired of being tired, I just want to sleep but my luteal phase is making it impossible."
Ever since having my second baby the rage and impatience I feel during my luteal stage is unbearable. Yesterday I completely lost it and yelled at my husband in front of my son. My guilt is swallowing me. I’m so mad at myself. I feel like if I have self-awareness I should be able to cope and take precautions with my family. But I also think I’m struggling and I’m scared that I didn’t control my rage.
"The hormonal rollercoaster of having a newborn is brutal. I’m usually a calm and collected person, but lately, I’ve been snapping at everyone and it’s driving me crazy."
"I feel like I’m going insane. The anger and frustration during my luteal phase are overwhelming, and I’m terrified of how it’s affecting my family."
"I know it’s not my fault, but I feel like a terrible person for losing my temper. I’m so scared that I’m hurting my children with my behavior."
"I’m trying to manage my emotions, but it’s so hard. I’m constantly on edge, and even the smallest things send me over the edge."
"I need help. I’m drowning in guilt and shame, and I’m scared that I’m not going to be able to get through this alone."
"around 10 days before my period I get oppressively suicidal thoughts, and within 2 days of my period those thoughts go away. I also get really painful cramps, chills, my anxiety goes through the roof, I'm super self conscious about my appearance and am very uncomfortable in my body. I also get really irritable and frustrated and easily/accidentally get into arguments."
"My period is like a mini-apocalypse, and it feels like I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions and physical discomfort."
"The week before my period is the worst. I feel completely overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and body image issues."
"The days leading up to my period are a real struggle, and I'm just waiting for that awful cramps to kick in."
I'm so grateful when my period finally comes because it means the suicidal thoughts and anxiety will be gone soon.
"These hormonal fluctuations are driving me crazy! I'm emotional, irritable, and I can't even look at myself in the mirror."
I’ve been dealing with PMDD for about 10 years now... I am on SSRI that keep me from having suicidal ideation about 95% of the time. My physical symptoms are just AWFUL... It’s hell to be in my body 50% of the time.
"I've been battling PMDD for a decade now, and it's been a constant struggle."
"The physical symptoms of PMDD are so intense, it feels like I'm living in a nightmare half the time."
"The SSRIs I'm on help significantly with my suicidal thoughts, but the physical pain is still unbearable."
"It's a constant fight to manage PMDD, and sometimes it feels like I'm losing."
"I feel like I'm trapped in my own body, and it's a living hell."
I feel I’m a bit uneducated on this so anything will help...I still haven’t made a decision on getting one because I have heard so many horror stories. I just feel very lost at how I can help myself medically.
I'm feeling overwhelmed by all the conflicting information and I'm not sure which direction to go in.
I'm honestly a bit scared to make a decision because I've heard so many negative stories.
"I'm just trying to make the best choice for myself, but I feel like I need more information to make an informed decision."
I wish there was someone I could talk to who could help me understand my options better.
It's just so confusing and I'm afraid of making the wrong choice.
"My symptoms have suddenly just been so bad I’m unable to function. PMDD is ruining my life and I don’t know what to do... I was told it can take a couple months to work, though. Do you think there’s still a chance it could start helping me by next cycle? I’m just praying it does, I can’t take this anymore."
"I feel like I'm losing control, I can't even do the basic things I need to."
"This constant struggle is taking its toll, I'm exhausted and desperate for relief."
"The thought of going through another cycle like this is unbearable, I need something to work."
"I'm clinging to hope that this treatment will finally start to make a difference, I just need a break."
"It's like my body is betraying me, I just want to feel normal again."
"I'm flat, I have no libido, I want to die half the week, I'm crying every day, my husband and I fight every day"
"I feel completely empty, like there's no joy left in me."
"I'm just going through the motions, I don't even feel like myself anymore."
"Every day is a struggle, I'm so tired of feeling this way."
"My life feels so bleak, I don't even know how to get out of this rut."
"I'm just existing, not truly living, it's like I'm trapped in my own body."
"Luteal phase kicks in and it all unravels - cravings, water retention and bloating, anger, depression, constipation."
"Luteal phase is a real rollercoaster ride - mood swings, fatigue, and cravings are just the beginning."
"Once the luteal phase starts, it's like a domino effect - one symptom after another."
I swear the luteal phase is a conspiracy - why do we have to suffer through all this?
"Luteal phase is like a cruel joke - just when you think you're feeling good, boom, you're hit with all these symptoms."
"The luteal phase is a constant struggle - trying to stay positive while battling bloating, fatigue, and emotional turmoil."
"I feel like the ugliest woman in the world. I don’t like making eye contact with people. My face is puffy, I have acne, my skin looks dull. Everything looks crazy."
I hate how I look in the mirror. It’s like I’m a stranger to myself.
I feel so insecure about my appearance. It’s hard to go out in public.
I wish I could just disappear. I’m so embarrassed by how I look.
I feel like I’m constantly being judged for how I look. It’s exhausting.
I just want to feel confident and beautiful. I’m so tired of feeling ugly.
I am so angry that I was screaming at myself. I just want this to fucking stop. I want to enjoy my life and my kids and I don’t control my emotions. I am always fucking sad. ... I am so desperate to feel happy again. I am so desperate to laugh and feel calm. I am so desperate. I don’t want to be sad anymore.
"I'm tired of feeling like I'm drowning in sadness, I just want to feel a glimmer of joy again."
I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of negativity and I don't know how to break free.
"I'm so desperate to feel alive again, to experience the simple things that make life worth living."
"I'm exhausted from fighting these emotions, I just want to feel peace."
It hurts so much to be surrounded by my loved ones and not be able to share in their happiness.
I have bad health anxiety so it reassure me a bit that im not dying
"I get really anxious about my health, so it's a relief to know I'm not actually dying."
"My health anxiety is so bad, but knowing I'm not dying gives me a little peace of mind."
"I worry about my health all the time, but it's comforting to know I'm not actually going to die."
"I have a lot of health anxiety, so knowing I'm not dying helps me to feel a little bit better."
"I'm always worried about my health, but knowing I'm not dying makes me feel slightly calmer."
Woke up and first thing I noticed is brain fog off the bat. Irritability first thing in the morning and the feeling of nicpicing on everything in the way. OCD.
"I woke up feeling groggy and irritable, like everything was just a little too much."
The day started with a brain fog and an overwhelming feeling of annoyance.
"I'm just not myself this morning, everything feels like a chore."
"My head feels fuzzy and I'm on edge, everything's getting to me."
"I'm struggling to focus and I'm easily frustrated, just a bad start to the day."
"I notice lately my AC can be blasting and I’m still SO HOT. I don’t have a temperature, but the only thing that can literally help cool me down is a fan on me."
"It seems like my AC isn't working properly, even though it's on full blast, I'm still feeling incredibly hot."
"I'm sweating profusely even with the AC on full blast, it's like it's not even doing anything."
"I've been feeling unbearably hot lately, and even the AC can't seem to cool me down, a fan is the only thing that offers some relief."
"My body feels like it's on fire, the AC isn't doing anything to help, I need a fan to even slightly cool down."
"I'm constantly feeling flushed and hot, despite the AC being on, I feel like my body is just generating too much heat."
"I am stressed out and over-stimulated and just need space. I get triggered, spaz out, and move so she will leave me alone."
I'm feeling overwhelmed and need some time to myself. I react badly when I'm pushed and just want to be left alone.
"I'm so frazzled, I can't handle anything right now. I get easily agitated and need some space to decompress."
I'm overloaded and my anxiety is through the roof. I'm trying to avoid conflict by getting away from her.
"I'm at my limit, I just want to disappear and be left alone. I don't mean to act out, I just need a break."
"My nerves are shot, I can't handle any more right now. When I'm stressed, I tend to react impulsively and I just need some space to calm down."
i cried uncontrollably for an hour
I couldn't stop crying for a whole hour.
My tears wouldn't stop for an entire sixty minutes.
I sobbed uncontrollably for a long time.
"I was a complete wreck, crying for an hour straight."
I was overcome with sadness and couldn't stop crying for an hour.
"I've been on it for 5 days and have noticed mood improvements, but I've also been pushing through some uncomfortable side effects such as fatigue, insomnia, and a gruesome migraine attack."
"I've been experiencing some rough side effects like fatigue, but the mood boost is worth it."
"I'm feeling a bit drained from this medication, but the positive effects on my mood are noticeable."
"The fatigue and headaches are a bit of a struggle, but I'm glad to see my mood improving."
"It's been a tough week with the side effects, but I'm hoping they'll lessen soon as my mood continues to get better."
"Despite the unpleasant side effects like the migraine, I'm seeing a difference in my mood and that's encouraging."
I’m just STRESSSSSSSEDDDDDDD! I already took some Xanax to calm me down. I’m stuck just melting in my own grease. I am physically paralyzed
I feel like I'm drowning in my own anxieties.
I'm completely overwhelmed and I can't seem to function.
Everything feels so heavy and I can't seem to move.
"I'm so exhausted, I just want to sleep for a week."
My mind is racing and my body is completely frozen.
"I can become irritated because I can’t find something, or I can become stressed or angry about something from work... I feel that these upsets are natural and would happen w or w/o PMDD... I feel so much pain from how unfeeling he can be knowing how much I’ve gone through due to this medical condition that I can’t control."
"I can't help but feel frustrated when things don't go my way, especially when it comes to my health."
"It's hard to deal with the added stress of this condition, especially when it makes me feel like I'm not in control."
It's incredibly disheartening to feel like my partner isn't empathetic towards my struggles.
I just wish I could make him understand the immense physical and emotional pain I'm going through.
I'm tired of feeling like a burden and having to constantly explain myself.
pain in scalp during luteal/bleeding
Scalp pain is bothering me during my luteal phase/period.
I've been experiencing scalp pain around the time of my period.
"I'm noticing some discomfort in my scalp, especially during my bleeding."
The luteal phase is when I typically experience scalp pain.
Scalp pain is a common symptom for me during my menstrual cycle.
small fear or frustration from me > he takes it super seriously even if I say that things might be distorted because it's luteal > things spiral out of hand and I say exagerrated stuff. He gets very depressed and upset. And then I have to pick up the pieces of myself and the pieces of the relationship.
"Küçük bir endişem veya hayal kırıklığımdan dolayı çok ciddiye alıyor, hatta ben luteal dönemde olduğum için bazı şeylerin çarpıtılmış olabileceğini söylesem bile, işler kontrolden çıkıyor ve ben abartılı şeyler söylüyorum. Çok depresif ve üzgün oluyor. Sonra da hem kendimin hem de ilişkinin parçalarını toplamak zorunda kalıyorum."
"Küçük bir şeyden bile olsa üzüntüm veya sinirlenmem onu çok etkiliyor, luteal dönemde olduğumu ve bazı şeylerin abartılı olabileceğini söylesem bile, işler kontrolden çıkıyor ve ben de sinirlenerek konuşuyorum. Çok moral bozuluyor ve üzülüyor. Sonra da hem kendimi hem de ilişkiyi toparlamak benim sorumluluğum oluyor."
"Ufak bir endişem veya hayal kırıklığı bile onu çok derinden etkiliyor, luteal dönemde olduğumu ve bazı şeylerin çarpıtılmış olabileceğini söylesem bile işler çığırından çıkıyor ve ben de abartılı konuşuyorum. Çok depresif oluyor ve moralini bozuyor. Sonunda ise hem kendimi hem de ilişkimizi toparlamak zorunda kalıyorum."
"Küçük bir endişem veya hayal kırıklığım bile onu çok ciddiye alıyor, luteal dönemde olduğumu ve bazı şeylerin çarpıtılmış olabileceğini söylesem bile işler kontrolden çıkıyor ve ben de abartılı şeyler söylüyorum. Çok üzgün ve moralsiz oluyor. Sonrasında hem kendimi hem de ilişkimizi toparlamak zorunda kalıyorum."
"Küçük bir şeyden bile olsa korkum veya hayal kırıklığımdan dolayı çok ciddi tepkiler veriyor, luteal dönemde olduğumu ve bazı şeylerin çarpıtılmış olabileceğini söylesem bile, olaylar kontrolden çıkıyor ve ben de abartılı konuşuyorum. Çok üzüntüye kapılıyor ve moralsiz oluyor. Sonra da hem kendimi hem de ilişkimizi toparlamak zorunda kalıyorum."
"I was diagnosed with PMDD at 20 years old im 40 now, it was managed well for my lifetime with fluoxetine and avoiding all hormonal BC. That suddenly stopped working a few years ago and after much investigation here we are. 90% of my physical menopause symptoms are being well managed, but my PMDD is still horrendous."
"For years, fluoxetine and avoiding hormonal birth control kept my PMDD in check, but now, nothing seems to work anymore."
"It's frustrating that my PMDD is back with a vengeance, even though the rest of my menopause symptoms are being managed."
"I thought I had found a solution to my PMDD, but after years of success, it's come roaring back."

I won't let PMDD control me anymore.
"PMDD is my enemy, and I will overcome her."
"I don't feel like myself, I'm depressed, easily irritated over the smallest things, I overthink and question all my relationships and every little detail in them, I have absolutely zero confidence, and the list goes on. One day I am super confident and loving life, and the next I am questioning his love for me, thinking he is annoyed with me, saying that he doesn’t really love me, but he has never done a single thing that would prove otherwise."
"I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster, one minute I'm on top of the world, the next I'm spiraling down into self-doubt."

I want to climb any man that would normally be only vaguely attractive to me... really just anything involving a man being nice to me or looking cute
"I'm so desperate for attention, I'll even settle for someone I wouldn't normally find attractive."
"If a guy is kind and sweet, I'll find him cute, even if he isn't conventionally attractive."

"I'm not really into looks, I just want someone who is genuine and makes me feel good."
I'm open to dating anyone who is nice and shows me some attention.
"My brain's always like: 'Well, what even is this PMDD crap, it's probably not even real and you're probably just doing something wrong to feel this way'."
"My brain always tells me 'You're just overreacting, this isn't really happening, you're making it up.'"
"My brain's like, 'That's not even a real thing, stop being dramatic.'"
It's like my brain wants to dismiss the whole thing as a figment of my imagination.
"It's like my brain tries to invalidate my feelings by saying it's not real, I'm just making it up."
"My brain always tries to rationalize away my feelings, saying it's all in my head, that it's not actually happening."
"i've been feeling suicidal for the last five years, ten times a year, for two weeks straight at a time. ...i'd be lying if i said that there isn't an urge to slit my throat every now and then...i notice that my pmdd symptoms worsen if there are a series of underlying problems...i'm also experiencing a revival of my age-old nemesis: BODY DYSMORPHIA! and high-functioning anxiety, inability to express emotions, bottling up emotions, flaring up...i hate how sometimes death feels like the only option"

"I had been the worst version of me for two weeks, unbearable...I feel crazy looking back on the past two weeks."
"I was completely out of control, acting like a different person."
"Looking back, I can't believe how bad I was acting."
Those two weeks were a blur of terrible decisions and behavior.
"I was at my absolute worst, and I'm ashamed of how I acted."
It feels like a different person was in my body for those two weeks.
"I can't think straight or regulate my emotions, I'm crying uncontrollibly at times and have serious brain fog. I can't sleep. I'm in debilitating pain from cramps"
I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and my body is failing me.
"I'm in a spiral of physical and emotional distress, I can't seem to catch a break."
"I'm feeling so physically and emotionally exhausted, I can barely function."
"My body and mind are in a state of constant turmoil, I feel like I'm falling apart."
I'm going through a really tough time right now and it's affecting every aspect of my life.
2 days before my period all hell breaks loose. It's like being possessed...I rage till I bleed. Unless you have this you have no idea how it can be like being in literal HELL in your own mind sometimes.
"I literally feel like a different person. I'm so irritable and angry, everything sets me off."
"It's not just a little bit of crankiness, it's like an uncontrollable beast taking over."
"It's like my body is betraying me, and I can't do anything to stop it."
"I feel like I'm going insane, and I know it's just my hormones, but it's so hard to deal with."
"My emotions are a roller coaster, and it's exhausting. I just want it to be over."
I first started mentioning my PMS symptoms before I suspected I may have PMDD
I started noticing my PMS symptoms before I realized I might have PMDD.
It wasn't until I started paying attention to my PMS symptoms that I thought I might have PMDD.
I didn't initially connect my PMS symptoms with the possibility of PMDD.
I was tracking my PMS symptoms before I suspected I might have PMDD.
I had been noticing my PMS symptoms for a while before I considered the possibility of PMDD.
"I had depression and anxiety after a wonderful pregnancy in 2017. Eventually this resolved into obvious alternating good and very bad times (anxiety, depression, fatigue etc)."
I was surprised by the emotional rollercoaster I experienced after a fulfilling pregnancy.
"It was like a switch flipped, going from pure joy to feeling completely drained and anxious."
"The highs and lows were so extreme, it was hard to keep up with my own emotions."
"Looking back, it was a period of intense emotional swings, from pure elation to complete despair."
"I felt like I was living on two different planets, one with joy and contentment, the other with deep darkness and anxiety."
"I always felt was different than everyone else’s even when I was a teenager, but the depression, anxiety and hopelessness is worst it makes me fearful."
"I've always felt like I didn't belong, even as a kid, but the depression, anxiety, and hopelessness are unbearable, they make me terrified of the future."
"I've always felt like an outsider, even in high school, but the depression, anxiety, and despair are so overwhelming, it fills me with dread."

"I've always felt like I was on the outside looking in, even in my teenage years, but the depression, anxiety, and despair are overwhelming, they fill me with a sense of fear and hopelessness."
"I become a completely insane person a few days a month... I am just a raging beast, and I know I'm being irrational but can't get out of it."
"I'm just a volcano about to erupt every few weeks, and it's exhausting."
"Some months, I'm like a time bomb ticking, and I can't control it."
"There are these cycles where I become this unpredictable force of nature, and I just have to weather the storm."
"It's like a switch flips and I'm a completely different person, and I just have to wait for it to pass."
"It feels like I'm possessed by this primal rage for a few days, and I can't even recognize myself."
I'm a demon for half my cycle
I'm a different person every other day.
"Half the time I'm a joy to be around, and the other half, well, let's just say I'm a bit of a handful."
"My moods are cyclical, I'm either up or down."
"I'm two sides of the same coin, sometimes good, sometimes bad."
There's a Jekyll and Hyde to my personality.
"I have that usual monthly feeling that I’d rather not be alive. Already on maximum antidepressants, so genuinely don’t know where I go from here. All I know is it’s getting more debilitating."
"I'm so drained, I can't even imagine how I'll get through the next few weeks."
"The emptiness is back, and this time it feels deeper than ever."
"It's like I'm stuck in quicksand, struggling just to stay afloat."
"I feel like I'm drowning in despair, and there's no one to pull me out."
"I'm holding on by a thread, and I'm afraid I'm going to let go."
i didnt know it gets worse
"I thought it couldn't get any worse, but I was wrong."
It's just getting progressively worse.
This is a lot worse than I expected.
I didn't realize things could get this bad.
This is just the beginning of the misery.
I went through something I call '2nd puberty' and that's when it went down hill. New period pains
"My body's been going through some wild changes lately, it's like I'm going through puberty all over again."
"I've been feeling so different, like a whole new set of challenges emerged."
"It feels like everything's getting more intense and difficult, not just the period cramps."
"I'm struggling with these new symptoms, and I can't help but think it's related to this 'second puberty' phase."
"It's like my body is rebelling against me, and it's making life a lot harder."
I feel like a completely different person and my periods themselves are worse than ever. I completely lose the ability to think rationally. I suddenly want to just yeet.
"My emotions are all over the place, and it feels like I'm not even myself."
"I can't focus on anything when I'm on my period, it's like my brain just shuts down."
"I'm so irritable and angry, I just want to scream and throw things."
"I feel like I'm going crazy, and I don't know what to do about it."
"It's like a completely different person takes over my body, and I have no control."
"my rage and mental health stuff intensifies every year, but the period itself has been dying down since I hit 30. used to have the most brutal heavy periods... and that has been winding down as the wrath and paranoia winds up"
"My anger and anxiety have been getting worse each year, but my period has become lighter since I turned 30."
"I used to have really painful periods, and while that's been getting better, my anger and paranoia have been increasing."
"The intensity of my period has decreased over the years, but my rage and mental health issues have grown stronger."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling my anger and anxiety, even though my period is becoming less severe."
"My mental health and period seem to be on opposite ends of a seesaw, with one getting better as the other gets worse."
"my symptoms have gotten worse, since I turned 37... these past few years have been some of the most stressful years of my life, which could be why my symptoms have exacerbated"
"My health has been declining since I hit my mid-thirties, and I'm starting to think the pressure of work has taken a toll."
"I've been feeling increasingly run-down lately, and I can't shake the feeling that it's all the stress from the past few years."
"The past few years have been so demanding, it's no surprise that my body is starting to show the effects."
"I've been noticing a decline in my physical well-being, and I suspect the constant pressure I've been under has contributed to it."
It's like my body is breaking down under the weight of all the stress I've been carrying around.
Mine started when I was a teen and have actually gotten slightly better with age and figuring out how to manage it.
"I've been dealing with anxiety since I was a teenager, and it's actually gotten a bit easier to manage as I've gotten older and learned coping mechanisms."
"My depression started in my teenage years, and I've slowly figured out how to better manage it as I've gotten older."
"I've had insomnia since I was young, but it's actually gotten a bit better with age and learning to manage my sleep habits."
"I've struggled with ADHD since I was a kid, and it's gotten slightly easier to manage as I've learned coping strategies and gotten older."
"I've dealt with panic attacks since I was a teenager, and it's gotten slightly easier to deal with as I've gotten older and learned how to manage them."
my mental health has me concerned and there are some physical things as well typical cramps stuff like that
"My mental health is a cause for concern, and I've also been experiencing some physical discomfort like cramps."
"I'm worried about my mental state, and on top of that, I've been dealing with some physical issues, like typical cramps."
"My mental health is really affecting me, and I'm also experiencing some common physical things, like cramps."
"I'm concerned about my mental wellbeing, and on top of that, I've been dealing with some typical physical symptoms, like cramps."
"My mental health is a real worry for me, and there are some physical things happening too, like cramps and stuff."
I still cycle every month just like I did before without the period
"I still have my monthly cycle, just without the bleeding."
"My period is gone, but my cycle is still regular."
"I'm still experiencing the same hormonal changes every month, just without the actual bleeding."
"My body is still going through its monthly cycle, even though I don't have a period anymore."
"I still have the same symptoms every month, like mood swings and bloating, even without a period."
"Developed PND, which left me suicidal. I turned 40 last month, and was only diagnosed with PMDD 3 weeks ago after getting intrusive thoughts, realising I was struggling with my moods, going back on citalopram and starting CBT."
"The past few years have been a rollercoaster of emotions, culminating in a diagnosis of PMDD that only amplified the struggles I'd been facing with my mental health."
"I've always been prone to mood swings, but the severity of my recent symptoms, including intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideation, made me realize something was seriously wrong."
"Turning 40 felt like a turning point in my life, and unfortunately, it coincided with the realization that I needed to seek professional help for my mental health."
"The diagnosis of PMDD explained so much about my past experiences, and it felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders even though it also brought a wave of new challenges."
"Citalopram and CBT are giving me the tools I need to manage my PMDD, but the journey is far from over and I know it will take time to heal."
i rely more stressed now than ever
I feel more pressure than I ever have before.
My stress levels are higher now than they've ever been.
I'm constantly feeling overwhelmed and anxious.
I can't remember the last time I felt truly relaxed.
This situation is causing me a lot more anxiety than I'm used to.
"I seem to manage the lows of pmdd so much better than when I was young. I know not to drink alcohol and get more sleep, exercise and keep my blood sugar levels stable."
I've learned how to handle the tough times of PMDD better than I did in my younger years.
"These days, I'm much better at managing the difficult symptoms of PMDD."
"I used to really struggle with PMDD, but now I know how to manage it better."
"Now that I'm older, I'm able to cope with the lows of PMDD much more effectively."
"I've learned to take better care of myself during PMDD, and it makes a big difference."
I’m cooked.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm totally beat.
I'm done for the day.
I'm ready to call it a night.
I'm finished.
"I have adhd, endometriosis and suspected autism. The anxiety this time was off the charts. I have stage 4 endo and that does not help. But I do take medication (ssri, duloxetine, it helps a lot!) and i’ve upped my dose and that helped."
"I'm constantly battling a whirlwind of medical issues, and the anxiety this time was just unbearable."
"It's hard enough dealing with endometriosis and ADHD, but now with the suspicion of autism, my anxiety is through the roof."
"I'm trying my best to manage all these conditions, but sometimes it feels like the anxiety is overwhelming."
The combination of my chronic illnesses and the added stress of possible autism has made my anxiety skyrocket.
"The anxiety I'm feeling is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and it's hard to cope with all of my medical challenges."
I do feel like I can manage the symptoms better despite of the worsening.
"Despite the worsening situation, I believe I can still manage the symptoms effectively."
"Although things are getting worse, I still feel capable of handling the symptoms."
"I am confident in my ability to manage the symptoms, even though the situation is deteriorating."
"The symptoms may be worsening, but I feel I can still cope with them effectively."
"While the condition is getting more severe, I am able to manage the symptoms better than before."
"I struggle monthly with not being dragged to my death by suicidality that comes up around my period. My moods are really hard to deal with, and I have to cordon myself off from others until it passes because otherwise I might flip out at someone and I have done that and it was so mortifying."
My period makes me feel so suicidal that I have to isolate myself to avoid hurting anyone.
The mood swings I get around my period are so intense that I need to distance myself from people.
"It's a constant struggle to manage my emotions during my period, and sometimes I feel like I'm going to lose control."
I have to be extra careful around my period because I'm prone to lashing out.
"The feeling of being overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts during my period is terrifying, and it makes me feel like I'm losing myself."
I have more stress than I did 20 years ago so perhaps the PMDD just seems worse.
"I'm not sure if it's just me, but things seem a lot more stressful now than they were 20 years ago."
"I'm feeling a lot more pressure these days, so maybe that's why the PMDD symptoms feel more intense."
"I used to handle things better, but now the stress is really getting to me, making the PMDD feel worse."
"Maybe I'm just getting older, but the stress of daily life is definitely taking a toll on my mental health."
"I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like the world is a much more stressful place than it used to be."
I developed PMDD out of nowhere two years ago. It already feels like it’s been getting worse over the years. I’m scared…
"I was completely blindsided by PMDD two years ago, and it's been a constant uphill battle since then."
"The onset of PMDD was so sudden and unexpected, and I can't shake the feeling that it's only getting more intense with time."
"It's been two years since PMDD came out of nowhere, and the impact it's had on my life is becoming more and more unbearable."
"It's terrifying how quickly my PMDD symptoms have worsened over the last few years, and I'm not sure what the future holds."
"The thought of dealing with PMDD for the rest of my life is incredibly daunting, and I'm afraid of what it will do to my overall well-being."
it gets worse each year from about 25 and on
It seems to get harder and harder to manage life as you get older.
"The older you get, the more you realize how much there is to learn."
"After a certain age, you start to feel the wear and tear of time."
There's a definite decline in energy levels after your mid-twenties.
The challenges of life don't seem to get any easier as you age.

I started taking sertraline and my symptoms got a lot more manageable. I have bad cycles here and there
I've been on sertraline for a few months now and it's definitely helped with the intensity of my symptoms.
"I'm still having some bad days, but they're not as frequent or severe since I started taking sertraline."
"Sertraline has made a big difference for me, but I still have some ups and downs."
"It's not a miracle cure, but sertraline has definitely made my symptoms more manageable."
"I'm still working on finding the right balance, but I'm feeling a lot better since starting sertraline."
"35 here, and worse than ever. Although when I was younger I self medicated with drugs and alcohol and had no idea what was going on with me every month. Just thought it was depression."
"I'm 35 now, and the symptoms are worse than ever. Back when I was younger, I used drugs and alcohol to cope, but I had no idea what was happening to me every month. I just thought it was depression."
"My anxiety is worse now than it ever was. When I was younger, I was able to numb it with drugs and alcohol, but now I have no idea what's wrong with me. I just assumed it was depression."
"I'm 35 and my anxiety is through the roof.  I used to rely on drugs and alcohol to get by, but now I'm realizing that I was just covering up the real problem. I didn't even know I was experiencing anxiety for years, I just thought it was depression."
"I'm 35 years old and it's the worst it's ever been. When I was younger, I would use drugs and alcohol to numb the feeling, but I didn't understand what was going on. I always thought it was just depression."
"My anxiety is at its worst now at 35.  I used to mask it with drugs and alcohol when I was younger, but now I have no idea what's happening. I thought it was just depression."
FIGHTING for my life each month
Her ay hayatta kalmak için mücadele ediyorum.
Her ay geçimimi sağlamak için mücadele ediyorum.

Her ay hayatta kalmak için savaş veriyorum.
Her ay geçimimi sağlamak için savaş veriyorum.
I haven’t been okay. I’ve tried to get periods July was more successful but I went crazy before and during. Like I’ve never experienced anxiety like this. My whole body went numb total like heat wave I’m just not okay. I feel so out of place. Not me and that birth control helped calm down my symptoms for a while but I stopped taking them or maybe they were losing their effectiveness by my hormones getting worse possibly to menopause now. Before it’s be just my body but now I feel it mentally.
"I've been struggling lately, both physically and mentally. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions and I just can't seem to find a balance."
This anxiety is unlike anything I've ever felt before. It's consuming my thoughts and affecting my entire body.
"I've been trying to manage my symptoms, but nothing seems to be working. I'm so exhausted and frustrated."
It feels like my body is betraying me. I can't even recognize myself anymore.
"I'm lost and alone. I feel like I'm falling apart, and I don't know what to do."
my cycle (and crazy days) are way less predictable
My life is full of unexpected twists and turns.
"I'm always on the go, and things change so quickly."
It's hard to know what each day will bring.
"My schedule is packed, and I never know what's going to happen next."
"I'm always on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what happens."
I'm freaking suicidal
I feel like I can't go on anymore.
Life seems pointless right now.
I'm so lost and hopeless.
"I'm in so much pain, I just want it to stop."
I don't think I can handle this anymore.
It’s so bad the last year
The past year has been absolutely terrible.
I can't believe how awful the last year has been.
This last year has been a complete disaster.
I'm so glad this year is finally over.
I just want to forget about the last year.
"I’m definitely more aware of my symptoms, I didn’t figure out that (some) of my mood issues were linked to my cycle until my late 20s and I didn’t learn what PMDD was until my early/mid 30s"
I wasn't aware of how much my physical and emotional health were interconnected until I started paying more attention.
"It took me a while to realize that my fluctuating moods were tied to my menstrual cycle, and then even longer to understand what PMDD actually was."
I didn't understand the severity of my symptoms until I was older and started doing some research.
"I used to just brush off my mood swings as normal, but now I know that they're actually a sign of something bigger."
"It's frustrating that it took me so long to get a diagnosis, but I'm glad I finally know what's going on."
getting worse
Things are getting worse.
The situation is getting worse.
The problem is getting worse.
It's getting worse and worse.
Everything is getting worse.
6 months back I was so convinced that all these symptoms was because of something else because it wasn’t this bad before. I mean I was emotional but it was manageable.It gets so much worse every year and I am not even 25 yet.
"I was really hoping that these symptoms were just a temporary thing, because things were so much better before."
"It feels like this has been slowly getting worse for years, and it's really starting to scare me."
"I'm only 24, and I feel like I'm already in a downward spiral, and I don't know how to stop it."
"I just thought it was stress or something, but now I realize this is something much more serious."
I wish I had taken things more seriously when I first started noticing these symptoms.
I did have to call out of work last week on a really bad day because I legit could not stop crying and had the worst body dysmorphia.
I was feeling so down and anxious last week that I had to take a day off work.
My body dysmorphia was so bad last week that I couldn't even face going to work.
"It was a really rough day last week, and I had to call in sick because I was just a mess."
I was in such a bad place last week that I couldn't even function. I had to call out of work.
It's tough when you're struggling with body image issues. I was so overwhelmed last week that I couldn't even go to work.
"I get a bit scared every time my luteal phase starts because I know how unmanageable it is. Like I understand concepts but my brain still feels doom and gloom about small life problems, I can rationalise “this is not a big deal” but I still make a big deal out of it."
"My luteal phase is a real rollercoaster for me emotionally, I feel like I understand things logically but I can't help but overreact to even the smallest inconveniences."
"I know I shouldn't let my luteal phase get to me, but I feel like my brain just throws a switch and everything becomes a big deal."
"It's like my mind goes into survival mode during my luteal phase, even though I know everything is fine I can't shake this feeling of impending doom."
"My luteal phase is a reminder that even though I can rationalize things, my emotions can still get the better of me."
"The emotional whiplash during my luteal phase is real, one minute I'm calm and collected and the next I'm spiraling into anxiety about the most trivial things."
In my 20s and early 30s it was a mess.  I’m so amazed that I can now go back to school and study and have my life back.  It’s been such a blessing.
"My twenties and thirties were a chaotic period, but now I feel incredibly fortunate to have the chance to go back to school, learn, and rebuild my life."
I feel truly blessed to be able to return to school and start fresh after the difficult years I experienced in my twenties and early thirties.
"It's amazing how life can turn around. After the struggles of my twenties and early thirties, I'm now able to pursue my education and start a new chapter."
I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to go back to school and find my footing after the tumultuous years I spent in my twenties and early thirties.
"It's a real blessing to be able to study and find stability now, after the challenging times I endured in my twenties and early thirties."
gets worse when I’m partnered it gets worse
"When I'm working with someone, the situation deteriorates."
"It's like the more people involved, the worse things get."
I notice a decline in performance when I'm collaborating.
My individual efforts seem to be better than when I'm partnered up.
It's almost like my abilities diminish when I'm working with others.
got way worse around 35
Things really started to go downhill around age 35.
My health took a serious turn for the worse around 35.
I felt like I hit a wall around 35.
Life got significantly more challenging around 35.
My energy levels plummeted around 35.
idk how it can get worse 😮‍💨
I can't imagine how things could possibly get any worse.
"This is the worst it can possibly get, right?"
"I'm at my wit's end, I don't know how things could be worse."
"I'm so overwhelmed, I just don't see how it could get any worse."
"This is just a complete nightmare, I don't know how things could get any worse."
my symptoms have gotten MUCH worse in the last 6 months

Turning 40 was the worst year of my life.
I'm still recovering from the horrors of my 40th year.
I've never been so miserable as I was when I turned 40.
Mine started late In my 20s and just gets worse now in my 30s

"It's been a struggle since I started in my 20s, and now it's even more difficult."

the last 10 years have been the worst
The past decade has been filled with nothing but misery.
I can't believe how much suffering I've endured in the last 10 years.
These past 10 years have been an absolute nightmare.
I wouldn't wish the last 10 years on my worst enemy.
The last 10 years have been a complete and utter disaster.
I am 40 and it's worse than ever :(
I feel like I'm getting older and things are just getting harder.
"Being 40 is not what I expected, and it's not good."
"Life just keeps getting more difficult, and I'm not sure how much longer I can handle it."
I'm struggling to cope with all the challenges that come with being 40.
"I feel like I'm constantly on a downward spiral, and I'm starting to lose hope."
I had to go on Prozac during the luteal phase! It’s helped A LOT.
"My luteal phase has been rough lately, so I'm finally trying Prozac to see if it helps."
"Prozac has been a game changer for me during my luteal phase, I'm so relieved!"
"I never thought I'd need medication for my luteal phase, but Prozac has been a huge help."
"The emotional rollercoaster of the luteal phase was getting to me, but Prozac has made a world of difference."
"I'm so glad I finally decided to talk to my doctor about my luteal phase struggles, Prozac has been a lifesaver."
it’s never been as bad as it has been in the past few years
Things haven't been this bad in a long time.
The situation has deteriorated significantly in recent years.
I can't recall a time when things were as dire as they are now.
The past few years have been the worst I've ever experienced.
It's gotten progressively worse over the last few years.
I flare up! It's like I have a chemical allergic reaction in my brain and body. I haven't had the dips to the dark side. It's not gone but it is manageable!
"I feel like I'm on edge, like my entire being is reacting to something unseen."
"It's like I'm being flooded with energy, but it's not a positive energy, it's more like a storm brewing inside."
"I'm overwhelmed, it's like my brain is overloaded and my body is trying to keep up."
"This feeling is so intense, it's like my body is having a physical reaction to my emotional state."
"I'm feeling a surge of emotion, it's not necessarily negative, but it's definitely powerful."
Mine became completely unmanageable a few years ago
Mine's behavior spiraled out of control a couple of years back.

Mine became a complete handful a few years ago.

it gets worse as I get older
Yaşlandıkça daha da kötüye gidiyor.
Her geçen gün daha da zorlaşıyor.
Vaktim geçtikçe işler daha da kötüleşiyor.
"Yaşlılık, hayatın zorluklarını artırıyor."
Ne kadar yaşlı olursam olaylar o kadar kötüleşiyor.
getting really bad at 36
I'm starting to feel really rusty at 36.
I'm not as good at 36 as I used to be.
My skills are declining at 36.
I'm losing my touch at 36.
36 is making me feel like I'm getting worse at things.
I think. Either that or as you age you become more aware and then you question why you are the way you are and realize it’s been PMDD the whole time…
"Maybe it's just me, but I feel like I'm finally understanding myself better as I get older."
I wonder if everyone goes through this period of self-discovery as they age.
"It's almost like I've been living with a blindfold on for years, and now I can finally see clearly."
"I used to think I was just a mess, but now I realize there might be a reason for my inconsistencies."
I'm starting to realize that my emotions have been a lot more complicated than I thought.
I need to work on managing my emotions better
I need to find a way to control my feelings more effectively.
I have to get better at handling my emotional reactions.
My emotional regulation skills need improvement.
I'm working on being more emotionally stable.
I need to learn how to express my emotions in a healthier way.
It just keeps getting worse.
Things are only getting more difficult.
The situation is deteriorating rapidly.
It's going from bad to worse.
Every day seems worse than the last.
I can't see things getting any better.
I've noticed that it swings and varies wildly-- but strongly linked to my overall levels of stress and life satisfaction.  I experienced the absolute worst PMDD symptoms around the time my marriage was threatening to blow up
"My emotional ups and downs are directly tied to the stress in my life, and I've noticed this is especially true during difficult times like the breakup of my marriage."
"It's clear that my emotions are closely connected to how happy and content I am, particularly when my life is in turmoil."
"The intensity of my PMDD symptoms was at its peak during the most stressful period of my marriage, making it even harder to cope."
I've come to realize that my emotional state is incredibly sensitive to changes in my overall stress levels and well-being.
"The highs and lows of my emotions are often unpredictable, but they seem to be connected to my overall satisfaction with my life and how stressed I am."
Waking up every day for 2 weeks out of the month wanting a quick death
"I'm so tired of this routine, I just wish I could sleep forever."
"These two weeks are pure torture, I can't even imagine how much longer I can do this."
Every morning I wake up and wish I hadn't.
"I'm so exhausted, I feel like I'm dying a little bit every day."
"My body is screaming for a break, but I can't seem to find one."
"I'm pretty sure I'm perimenopauseal. I only got diagnosed a few years ago, but it's definitely gotten worse."
"I've been having hot flashes and night sweats, it's definitely getting worse."
"My doctor said I'm perimenopausal, but the symptoms are getting really intense."
"The perimenopause is hitting me hard, I'm exhausted all the time and my mood is all over the place."
"I feel like I'm constantly on edge, I can't tell if it's just the perimenopause or something else."
"I'm worried about the next few years, the perimenopause is already taking its toll."

hoping some relief after menopause

it has progressively gotten worse

intrusive thoughts and anxiety getting really severe before my period
My premenstrual anxiety is getting out of control.
"I'm feeling so anxious and overwhelmed, it must be my period coming."
"The intrusive thoughts and anxiety are really bad right now, probably because my period is about to start."
"I can feel the premenstrual anxiety building up, it's so intense."
It's like my brain is on fire with anxiety before my period.
I felt the exact same way with my rage it was terrifying.
"I was completely overwhelmed by my anger, it felt like it could consume me."
"The intensity of my fury was shocking, it truly frightened me."
"My rage was so powerful, it felt like it could destroy everything around me."
"I've never felt so much anger before, it was a truly terrifying experience."
"The rage I felt was unlike anything I've ever experienced, it was utterly terrifying."
"Sometimes it's okay to settle for 'just okay' as far as your self goes. Because that's so much better than 'very not okay'. So, be gentle on yourself."
It's better to be content with being 'just okay' than to be constantly striving for perfection and feeling inadequate.
Don't beat yourself up if you're not achieving everything you want to. It's okay to be 'just okay' sometimes.
Give yourself permission to be 'just okay'. It's a much healthier approach than striving for perfection and feeling stressed.
"Instead of aiming for the impossible, why not be happy with being 'just okay'? It's a realistic and achievable goal."
Being 'just okay' is not a failure. It's a sign that you're taking care of yourself and accepting your limitations.
"What I hate is that 24-28 days I'm totally fine, but the 4 days before my period is so much worse as I get older"
"I'm feeling so much worse during my period lately, especially those 4 days before."
It's like my body just goes haywire the week before my period.
"The PMS symptoms are so much more intense as I've gotten older, it's awful."
I feel like I have a whole other personality in the days leading up to my period.
"These 4 days before my period are the worst, I'm so moody and irritable."
"When I’m alone, I can handle it. With a partner… we’re all doomed."
"I'm perfectly capable of managing my own life, but adding another person into the mix just seems to complicate things."
Being single is a lot easier than being in a relationship. There's just too much responsibility involved.
"I'm a lone wolf, but I'm actually quite happy that way.  I don't need anyone to tell me what to do."
"I'm not saying I'm against relationships, but I just find it easier to be on my own."
"Relationships are great for some people, but they're just not for me. I'm perfectly content with my own company."
Perimenopause is awful for us with PMDD.
Perimenopause symptoms are intensified for women with PMDD.
Life during perimenopause is incredibly difficult when you have PMDD.
The combination of perimenopause and PMDD makes things so much harder.
I can't imagine going through perimenopause without already having PMDD.
I feel like perimenopause is just adding insult to injury with my PMDD.

"At 45, I'm living my best life, even if it's a little different than I expected."
"I'm starting to feel like I have all the answers, but I'm not sure anyone wants to hear them."
Trying to fix it with hormones but it's just not working... super sensitive to any kind of hormone treatment or OTC hormones 😭
"I'm on hormone therapy, but I'm not seeing any improvement. It's making me incredibly sensitive to everything."
"Hormone treatment just isn't working for me, I'm reacting badly to everything."
"I'm trying to find the right hormone balance, but it's so difficult and I'm so sensitive."
"I'm so sensitive to hormones right now, I can't even take over-the-counter ones without reacting."
"Hormones just aren't the answer, I'm too sensitive to them."
I did go on the pill a year ago which HAS made it manageable!!!

"being threatened with divorce may be something I’ll never completely recover from, to be honest."
"Boşanma tehdidiyle karşı karşıya kalmak, dürüst olmak gerekirse, asla tamamen atlatamayacağım bir şey olabilir."
"Bana dürüst olmak gerekirse, boşanma tehdidinin yaralarını asla tamamen iyileştiremeyebilirim."
"İtiraf etmeliyim ki, boşanma tehdidi benim için derin bir yara oldu ve bunun izlerini bir türlü silemiyorum."
"Boşanma tehdidi, içimde silinmez bir iz bıraktı ve bunun acısını asla tamamen unutmayacağımı düşünüyorum."
"Boşanma tehdidinin verdiği acı, hala beni derinden etkiliyor ve bunun izlerini belki de hiçbir zaman tamamen silemeyeceğim."

"The news of a potential divorce, uttered by my husband while we were en route to my therapy session this past Saturday, left me reeling."
Saturday's drive to my therapy appointment was marred by my husband's surprising threat of divorce.
The tension in the car was palpable as my husband made his threat of divorce while we were driving to my therapy session this past Saturday.
"My husband's words, 'I might get a divorce,'  while we were on our way to my therapy session this past Saturday, sent chills down my spine."
"I was blindsided and I think I will always have at least the smallest doubt, even in good times and long-since-healed times, about whether he could secretly harbor such drastic thoughts that I don’t know about.  b+c) PMDD makes blowups way more likely for me, but I had a lot of perfectly valid stuff to blow up about that regular me was (still sometimes IS) choking down all the time. It’s just that the hell week werewolf ain't gonna deal with that shit."
"I can't help but wonder if there are things he keeps hidden, even now, even after everything has settled down."
"It's hard to shake the feeling that there's more to him than meets the eye, even when things are good."
"Even when I'm happy, a part of me always worries that he's capable of things I can't even imagine."
"I know I should be able to trust him, but there's this nagging doubt in the back of my mind."
"I keep replaying the events over and over, and I can't help but feel like there's something I'm missing."
I still feel really numb by everything.
"I'm still in shock, everything feels so surreal."
"I feel completely detached from everything, like it's happening to someone else."
"I haven't processed everything yet, it's just a blur."
"Everything feels distant and unreal, I can't seem to connect with it."

Was feeling absolutely bonkers the last few days
I've been completely out of it lately.
I've been feeling absolutely crazy the last few days.
My mind has been racing non-stop.
I haven't been myself at all.
I've been acting really strange.
I convince myself it’s all in my head and I’m so dramatic and then I am absolutely despondent
"I try to tell myself it’s just me overreacting, but then I feel completely hopeless."
"I try to rationalize it and say I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but then I just feel totally crushed."
"I keep telling myself it's all in my head and I'm being dramatic, but then I’m just utterly heartbroken."
"I try to convince myself it's not that serious, but then I’m just completely overwhelmed with despair."

a 2x a month disorder
I have a disorder that affects me twice a month.
I experience a disruption every two weeks.
This condition makes me feel unwell every other week.
My body goes through a cycle of imbalance every fortnight.
I suffer from a recurring problem that occurs bi-monthly.
It’s a neurosensitivity to progesterone metabolites. Telling people with PMDD to take progesterone is absolute madness and straight up dangerous.
"Progesterone metabolites can trigger intense emotional reactions in those with PMDD, so prescribing progesterone is like throwing gasoline on a fire."
Ignoring the neurobiological sensitivity to progesterone metabolites in PMDD and suggesting progesterone is a solution is reckless and irresponsible.
"The way progesterone affects the brain in women with PMDD is complex and unpredictable, making it a risky treatment option."
It's crucial to understand the unique neurochemical sensitivities of those with PMDD before recommending treatments like progesterone.
Treating PMDD without acknowledging the specific neurochemical sensitivities to progesterone metabolites is like trying to solve a puzzle with the wrong pieces.

"It took a long time for me to get a proper diagnosis for PMDD, even though I knew something was off with my hormones."
"Getting a PMDD diagnosis felt like a long and arduous journey, and it took a while to get confirmation through blood work."
"It was frustrating that the blood tests weren't showing the hormone imbalance right away, even though I knew I had PMDD."
The process of getting diagnosed with PMDD was challenging because the blood work didn't immediately confirm the hormone imbalance.
"I felt like I was battling against the system to get a PMDD diagnosis, as the blood work didn't align with my experience."
I have suddenly within the last 2 years developed PMDD...I started out small and now take very high doses of progesterone and to begin with it was pretty rough with all the symptoms but I hung in and omg I feel like a different person.

"I've been incredibly tired lately, and my mind just feels cloudy."
I'm struggling to focus and my thinking is really foggy these days.
I've been feeling so exhausted and my brain feels like it's completely shut off.
My energy levels are low and I can't seem to think clearly at all.
I'm constantly tired and I have no mental clarity whatsoever.
I feel entirely stupid at times while speaking during work meetings. I can’t seem to focus or retain details as easily either. I feel like both a babbling idiot and an annoyance asking people to repeat themselves or repeat instructions.
I feel like I'm constantly stumbling over my words and getting lost in the conversation.
Sometimes I just blank out and can't even remember what I was going to say.
"It feels like my brain just shuts off during meetings, and I can't seem to process anything."
I get so anxious during meetings that I feel like I'm going to say something completely ridiculous.
I hate feeling like I'm holding everyone up by asking for things to be repeated.

I feel like my boyfriend knowing when I’m in my luteal phase makes my life worse... He says my face changes and I seem glum... I feel unsettled... I miss being able to be a human in a relationship... just be grumpy and having understanding
My luteal phase feels like a curse because my boyfriend notices everything and makes me feel self-conscious.
"I don't like being so predictable and transparent during my luteal phase, especially with my boyfriend."
It's like I lose control of myself during my luteal phase and my boyfriend sees it all.

"I slept absolutely terribly last night. I got into bed around 8:30 and was up all night tossing and turning. I wasn’t particularly having full blown hot flashes, but any time I would stick a leg out to feel cool, the sensation of the fan blowing toward me drove me nuts. But I can’t sleep if I’m too hot."
"I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night.  The heat was so unbearable, I felt like I was roasting in my own bed."
"I tossed and turned all night, trying to find a comfortable position. It was just too hot, I couldn't sleep a bit."
"I was so uncomfortable all night, I couldn't stop moving. The fan made me feel even hotter, so I just kept flipping my covers on and off."

"I was sweating all night and I kept getting these chills and hot flashes. I don't know if it was the weather or just me, but I was miserable."
"I completely lost my cool this morning with my partner… and then asked my brother to come grab me so I could just get some space. I’m so exhausted of feeling out of control like this every month without feeling like I can clue into what emotions and feelings are valid for a situation? ... Most days I’m so proud of how far we’ve come but on days like this all I can think is how much of a failure I am at 29, unable to regulate myself, a burden to my partner and my wonderful family."
"I feel like I'm always on edge, and the smallest things can set me off."
"It's so frustrating to feel like I'm constantly losing control, especially when I know I need to be calm and collected."
I just need some time to myself to process everything and figure out what's going on.
"I hate that I feel like I'm letting everyone down, especially my partner and my family."
"I'm trying my best, but sometimes I just feel so overwhelmed."
"I had pmdd, she prescribed me yaz for treat it and I’ll be starting the generic. I’m so impatient and want it to start working right away for me because I’m so over it."
"I'm so tired of feeling this way, I just want to feel normal again."
"I'm desperate for relief, I can't take this anymore."
I'm hoping this medication will help me get my life back on track.
I'm counting down the days until I start feeling better.
"I'm willing to try anything to feel better, I'm so over this."
I can't even begin to tell people how much strength it takes not to fling myself off the balcony on the bad days...I don't know how to survive this...I don't want these feelings to win one day.

"I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not myself, and I can't even get anything done because of the brain fog."
"The physical symptoms are bad enough, but the emotional roller coaster is what really gets to me."
I feel like I'm letting everyone down because I can't be my best self during these times.
I haven't freaked out or had any meltdowns. I still have BDD but it's no worse than it is any other time of the month
"I'm doing surprisingly well, considering my usual anxieties."
I'm actually handling this better than I thought I would.
My BDD hasn't been any more intense than usual.
I'm surprised to say that I haven't had any major breakdowns.
I'm managing to keep it together even though I'm normally more sensitive around this time.

they make me feel better about my situation
They help me feel more optimistic about where I am.
They give me a sense of hope for the future.
Their presence makes me feel less alone.
Talking to them always brightens my mood.
They remind me that things can get better.
I feel like I’m spiraling.
I feel like I'm losing control.
Everything is getting out of hand.
"I'm just going down, down, down."
I can't seem to stop the downward slide.
I feel like I'm in freefall.
I was in luteal… She called me and asked what I was doing. I said “Watching a rom-com” and she asked “So your period is soon?”
"She knew I was in a mood for a good rom-com, so when I mentioned it, she teasingly asked about my period."
"My friend has this uncanny ability to know when I'm about to start my period, and she always knows how to make me laugh about it."
We were talking on the phone and she could just tell I was in my 'luteal phase' and asked about my period with a playful tone.
"It's funny how certain movies can make you feel a certain way, and my friend seemed to know exactly what mood I was in."
"I guess you could say there's a certain ‘luteal phase’ movie-watching ritual, and she's pretty much a master of it."
I call it 'getting PMDD'd' I've had to drop some truly excellent shows (and books) because of this effect!
"I feel like this happens every month, I just can't seem to enjoy anything I'm watching or reading."
"It's so frustrating, I know I'm being irrational but I can't help but feel this way."
"I've tried to fight it, but it just seems to take over my whole being."
"I miss being able to get lost in a good story, I just can't do it right now."
It's like my brain is just shutting off to anything I find enjoyable.
releasing the demonic feelings/thoughts
Kontrolü kaybetmek ve içimdeki kötü duyguların ortaya çıkmasına izin vermekten korkuyorum.
"Bana kötü düşünceler geliyor, bunlardan kurtulmam gerekiyor."
Sanki içimde bir canavar uyanıyor ve kontrolü ele geçiriyor.
Kendimi kötü duygulara kaptırmaktan korkuyorum.
Bu düşüncelerin beni ele geçirmesine izin vermemeliyim.
my brain craves it and then I can’t stomach them
"My mind keeps telling me to try it, but my body just won't cooperate."
"It sounds so good, but the thought of actually eating it makes me sick."
"I know I shouldn't, but the craving is so strong, I can't help myself."
"I'm so tempted, but I just can't bring myself to eat it."
"It seems appealing, but I just know it's going to make me feel bad afterwards."
On particularly bad days I watch stuff like Silence of the lambs for relaxation.
"On days when I'm feeling really stressed, I like to watch scary movies to unwind."
"When I'm having a rough day, I find comfort in watching psychological thrillers."
"Sometimes when I'm feeling overwhelmed, I escape into the world of horror movies."
"If I'm having a particularly bad day, I like to watch a good thriller to take my mind off things."
Watching intense movies like Silence of the Lambs is my way of de-stressing on days when I'm feeling down.
i have a hard time even switching between my fav comfort shows
I can't seem to choose between my favorite comfort shows.
It's hard for me to decide which of my favorite comfort shows to watch.
I get stuck when I try to pick between my go-to comfort shows.
"I'm torn between my favorite comfort shows, I can't settle on one."
Switching between my favorite comfort shows is a real struggle.
I'm too fidgety and restless. If I'm not crocheting or something similar while I watch TV i get distracted
"I can't just sit still and watch TV, I need to be doing something with my hands."
I have to keep myself busy or I'll end up getting bored and distracted.
"If I'm not doing something productive, I start to feel restless and antsy."
I can't seem to relax unless I'm working on something.
"I get so antsy when I'm not doing anything, I need to keep myself occupied."
I have all these dark thoughts and Im cynical about everything
I'm constantly battling negative thoughts and I doubt everything.
My mind is filled with pessimism and I see the worst in everything.
I can't seem to shake off this negativity and I question everything.
These dark clouds of doubt are constantly hanging over me.
I'm surrounded by despair and I'm skeptical of everything.
I find myself seeking out increasingly unsettling movies/podcast/youtube videos to watch just so I can get a rush bc feeling anything other than dysphoria sounds good to me
"I'm constantly on the hunt for more and more disturbing content, just to feel something other than this emptiness."
I'm so numb that I'm actively looking for things that make me uncomfortable just to feel something.
The only way I can get a jolt of any kind of emotion is by watching something absolutely terrifying.
I'm so desperate to feel anything other than this numbness that I'm even seeking out things that make me anxious.
I've hit a point where the only way to feel anything is to push myself to the edge with unsettling content.
i just made a post abt how i started sobbing once i started my period bc of how relieved i was & i realized how close i was to making some seriously dangerous mistakes to myself. ... i thought something REALLY terrible was wrong with me and almost ended up having a psychotic break.
"I'm so grateful to be on my period, it's such a relief to finally have it after everything I've been through."
"The stress of not knowing what was wrong with me was overwhelming, I was seriously considering doing things that would have hurt me."
"It's crazy how your body can play tricks on you, I was convinced something was seriously wrong with me."
"Looking back, I can't believe how close I came to making a really bad decision because I was so scared."
"The relief I felt once my period started was so intense, it was like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders."
I don’t want to tell my parents I have PMDD...My symptoms have been so bad and nothing has been working and I’m so scared of myself and I don’t know what to do.
"I'm so scared of what they'll think, what they'll say, and I don't want to worry them."
"I feel like I'm losing control, and I don't know how to explain it to them."
"I feel like I'm letting everyone down, and I don't know how to cope with it all."
"I just want this to be over, but I don't know how to make it stop."
"I feel like I'm stuck in a nightmare, and I don't know how to wake up."
But on my break week I just look at their happy little wags and burst into tears…
"I just can't help but feel overwhelmed by the joy these dogs radiate, it's enough to make me cry."
"Their tails wagging so happily is just too much for me to handle, it makes me so emotional."
Seeing their pure joy and happiness during my break week leaves me feeling completely shattered.
"I'm completely overwhelmed by their innocent happiness, it's enough to make me weep."
"Their little wags are just too much for me, they fill me with such a mix of emotions that I can't help but cry."
"The brain fog is here... I could barely string a complex, analytical thought together. Or I overthink it to the point where it is just mincemeat."
"I feel like my brain is just mush today, I can't even process anything properly."
"It's like my thoughts are stuck in molasses, I can't get anything coherent out."
I'm struggling to focus.  Everything feels jumbled and confused.
I'm having trouble thinking straight.  I feel like I'm in a daze.
"It's like my mind is playing tricks on me, one moment I'm overthinking, the next I can't think at all."
I barely slept last night and today I'm doing BAD
"I'm so tired, I didn't get any sleep last night."
I'm running on fumes today after barely getting any sleep.
I'm feeling completely drained because I was up all night.
"My brain is fried, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night."
I'm struggling to stay awake today after such a bad night's sleep.
"I need help mostly with exhaustion, but also emotional regulation and low self-esteem, rumination, etc."
"I'm struggling with feeling drained all the time, and it's making it hard to manage my emotions and feel good about myself."
"My biggest issue is feeling exhausted, but I also need support with controlling my feelings, building my self-confidence, and stopping negative thoughts."
"I'm worn out and I'm finding it difficult to regulate my emotions, deal with my self-doubt, and break free from obsessive thoughts."
"I'm exhausted and I'm really struggling with my emotional control, my self-esteem, and these persistent negative thoughts."
"I'm feeling so tired and I need help managing my emotions, overcoming my self-doubt, and stopping myself from dwelling on negative things."
"During my bad days I get urges to say very harsh things that I, at that moment, think of as the truth. Sometimes by doing that I end friendships and push people away..."
"When I'm feeling down, I tend to say things that I think are true, but they come out really mean and end up hurting people."
"I have this terrible habit of being brutally honest when I'm upset, and it always backfires, costing me relationships."
"My anger often takes over, and I lash out with words that I regret later, knowing they're not really the truth but causing harm nonetheless."

"It's a double whammy, I have POTS symptoms and I'm also going through PMDD."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting against my body, with POTS symptoms and PMDD making it even harder."
"My PMDD is making everything difficult, and the POTS symptoms are making it even worse."
"basically all I want to do for close to two weeks before my period is kill myself and I cannot stop thinking about how worthless I am, how useless and 'no wonder no one likes me'. I have absolutely NO motivation to do anything. ...my emotions run so high I cry almost 7 times a day and self harm."
"I feel like I'm going crazy before my period, everything feels hopeless and I just want to disappear."
"My emotions are completely out of control, I feel so worthless and unlovable, it's like I'm trapped in a dark cloud."
"The days before my period are unbearable, I have zero motivation, and I can't stop thinking about how much I hate myself."
"I'm overwhelmed with negative thoughts, I feel so isolated and alone, and I just want everything to stop."

I’m already on antidepressants and birth control and still have severe mood swings every month
I'm really struggling with my mood even with medication and birth control.
I feel like nothing is working to control my mood swings.
My mood swings are so bad that I'm constantly on edge.
It's so frustrating that I still have severe mood swings even though I'm on medication.
I'm worried that my mood swings will never go away.
"For 2 weeks every month I contemplate separating from him. Everything he does bothers me including how he eats, what he says, how he says it, etc. I don’t like being around him during that time. The last few days before my period I am extremely negative, paranoid, and I constantly pick fights with him. I have high anxiety, horrible nightmares, ruminating thoughts about something bad happening, and suicidal ideation. I truly believe my family would be better off without me during that time and I cannot see outside of those thoughts."
"My PMS is like a monster that takes over my mind and makes me want to run away from everyone, especially him."
Those two weeks every month are pure hell. I feel like I'm going crazy and all I can think about is leaving him.
The negativity and anxiety are so overwhelming that I can't even function properly. I just want to disappear.
It's like a dark cloud hangs over me and I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I feel completely hopeless.
"I know it's not rational, but I honestly think I'd be doing everyone a favor by just leaving during that time."
"they want to put you on meds that are going to cause a wave of completely other problems. Such as hormonal issues, depression, headaches, weight gain, insomnia, etc."
They're trying to push these medications on you that are only going to lead to a whole new set of problems.
"They want you to take these drugs that will cause a cascade of side effects, like hormonal imbalances, mood swings, and weight gain."

been putting on a mask in work all week when I just want to curl in a ball and cry
I've been faking a smile at work all week when I just want to disappear.
"It's been hard to keep up the facade at work this week, I'm exhausted."
I'm so drained from pretending to be okay at work that I just want to crawl under the covers and hide.
I'm putting on a brave face at work but inside I'm falling apart.
I'm trying to keep it together at work but I'm at my breaking point.
"My file says that I suffer from PMS, but I remember us discussing PMDD."
"My doctor told me it's PMS, but I'm pretty sure it's PMDD."
"I looked up my symptoms online, and it says I have PMS, but I think it might be PMDD."
"The doctor said it was PMS, but my research suggests it's PMDD."
"I'm pretty sure I have PMDD, not just PMS."
"The article mentioned PMS, but I've been experiencing the symptoms of PMDD."
"I feel like I don't know how to socialize, or that people just don't like me or maybe they don't find me interesting enough, maybe I like weird things or have less common interest, I don't know. I still want friends, I try not to let those experiences shape me. Tomorrow is the first day of my cycle so I know why I'm feeling this intense sadness, it just sucks to deal with it alone."
"I'm struggling to connect with people, and I'm afraid it's because they just don't find me interesting enough, maybe even a bit weird. I don't want to let that stop me from making friends, but it's hard when I'm feeling so down about it."
"I wish I understood how to interact with people better, but I often feel like I'm doing something wrong. It's hard not to feel like I'm not good enough, but I remind myself that I deserve to have friends."
"I feel like I'm missing something, like I don't fit in. I try to be myself, but it feels like people don't get me. Maybe I'm just different, maybe I'm just not enough. I still want to connect, but it's hard when I feel so alone."
"I feel like I'm not interesting enough to make friends, maybe I'm too weird or I just don't know how to be social. It's hard to deal with those feelings, especially when I'm feeling so vulnerable right now."
"I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but I feel like I'm pushing people away. Maybe I just have different interests, maybe I'm just not trying hard enough. I wish I knew how to be better, but for now, I'm just trying to be myself."
I would have like 10 days before my period where I would have all of the extra bad psych symptoms and they would immediately stop the second I started my period... I don't want to hurt myself/others. I feel like I'm in control of myself again.
"I feel like a different person during my period, it's almost like a switch flips and I'm back to normal."
"The emotional rollercoaster during that week before my period is intense, but then it's over as soon as it starts."
"It's such a relief to feel like myself again once my period begins, the emotional turmoil is finally gone."
"I just want to be able to function normally during that week before my period, it's so difficult to deal with the extreme emotions."
I wish I could understand why I experience such severe mental health issues in the days leading up to my period.
I have been noticing PMS symptoms becoming worse and my moods harder to shake out of.
"I've been feeling extra sensitive lately, and it's been hard to get out of a bad mood."
"My PMS symptoms are getting stronger, and it's tougher than usual to stay positive."
"It feels like my PMS is hitting harder this time around, and I'm finding it difficult to snap out of bad moods."
"I'm noticing a worsening in my PMS symptoms, and it feels like I'm stuck in a cycle of negative emotions."
"I'm really struggling with my moods these days, and it feels like my PMS is making it even worse."
"I am utterly exhausted and just feeling like nobody around me really sees or understands...I just had this wall come crashing down on my life...it feels like every month or so, I just have a week where it feels like I literally have the flu a little bit and am fighting cramps and headaches and just outright miserable."
"I feel so overwhelmed and drained, like I'm constantly on the verge of breaking down."
It's like I'm constantly fighting a losing battle against exhaustion and pain.
"I just need a break, a moment to breathe and recover from this constant barrage of stress."
"I feel like I'm drowning in responsibilities and obligations, and I can't seem to stay afloat."
"I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not enough, like my struggles are invisible and unimportant."
"I am dizzy, nauseous and I’ve even had fever (felt very hot and flustered)."
"I feel terrible, I have a headache and I’m sweating profusely."
"I don't feel well at all, my head is pounding and I feel like I'm going to be sick."
"My body is aching, I can't stop shivering and I feel like I'm burning up."
"I’m so weak, I can barely stand up and I feel like I’m going to pass out."
"I feel completely drained, I just want to lie down and I’m so dizzy I can't focus."
I think I’ll be fine but then I find myself trying to hit myself in the head when the thoughts won’t stop. I truly want to rip my face off and scream continuously. I’m just a complete bitch and scream at my dogs... I actually feel insane.
I feel so overwhelmed that I just want to scream and run away from everything.
Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode with frustration.
I just want to hide from the world and never come out.
My mind is racing and I can't seem to calm down.
I'm so stressed out that I feel like I'm going to lose it.
I blame myself so much and it’s been over a year I still feel so sad about it. I miss her so fucking much and I wish she was here so badly. I’m 22 but I feel like a little girl lost in this world without her mom guiding her. I still needed her here.
"I feel so lost without her, like a ship without a compass."
"It's hard to move on, knowing that I'll never get to hear her voice again."
"Sometimes I imagine her here with me, but then I realize that's just wishful thinking."
I wish I could just rewind time and tell her how much I loved her.
"I feel so much regret, knowing that I didn't appreciate her enough when she was here."
"I've felt incredibly insecure right before my period...I felt anxious and, despite trying not to, I brought it up...I haven't told him yet because I feel ashamed and don't want to seem like I'm making excuses...I feel like shit now, thinking I should've just internalized it."
"I'm worried he'll think I'm being dramatic, and I don't want him to think that's the only reason I'm feeling this way."

I feel so overwhelmed right now.  I'm completely losing it.
I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore.

"I learned about antihistamines from the personal stories shared on this sub. Then I talked with my doctor, and now I'm taking them *with my doctor's approval and guidance*.

"This game I play in my head is a lifesaver when traffic is driving me crazy, it keeps me from blowing up."
"It's amazing how much a simple game can help with road rage, it's like a little mental escape."
"There are these little things I do to manage my road rage, like playing this game I made up, it really helps me stay in control."

My mood hasn't improved even after my menstruation has ended.
The sadness hasn't gone away even though I'm no longer menstruating.
I'm feeling depressed despite the fact that my period is finished.
I literally could feel it. The last 7 days I have been *so bloated*. It's been HELL. I was walking to work today and my clothes felt all uncomfortable. Now the same outfit feels like it's just hanging off me. Within a matter of hours it's like my whole body changed.
"The bloating has been so intense, I can literally feel my body changing shape."
"It's like my stomach has expanded by a whole size in the past week, it's crazy!"

"This premenstrual stuff is brutal, day 11 feels like an eternity, I'm just so uncomfortable."
"Feeling so run down, it's day 11 and I'm just not myself, this time of the month is rough."
I got headaches coming on so I went to hybrid where I took 12mg zoloft then upped it to 25mg.

I have chronic illness so I’m familiar with dismissive doctors that aren’t interested in learning or changing their methods.
I've dealt with a lot of doctors who don't take my concerns seriously and just brush me off.
It's frustrating to see doctors who refuse to listen or explore alternative approaches.
I've encountered doctors who are stuck in their ways and don't seem to care about finding the best solution.
I've had to fight for proper care because some doctors dismiss my illness.
I wish more doctors were open to learning and adapting their methods to individual patients.
I got burned out
I'm completely exhausted from working so hard.
I feel drained and have no energy left.
"I'm so tired, I can't even think straight."
I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed.
I need a break from everything.
"Oh I'm so done wasting my breath with family, friends, Drs. So done."
I'm exhausted from trying to explain myself to everyone.
I'm tired of arguing and being misunderstood.
I've given up trying to convince people to understand me.
I'm done with the constant drama and negativity.
It's not worth the energy to keep fighting.
i wanna wash the grumpy angry sad away :(
"I just want to feel better, you know?"
I'm so tired of feeling this way.
Maybe a nice shower will help.
I just need a fresh start.
I'm trying to be positive but it's hard.
"I have ADHD. I just got officially diagnosed, age 32. There is a lot of research coming out to show that hormones make ADHD symptoms worse, which is why I’ve been going crazy around a week before my period (but sometimes all around it too)."
"I just found out I have ADHD, and I'm 32! I've been dealing with symptoms for years, and it all makes sense now."
"Apparently, hormone fluctuations can make ADHD symptoms worse, and that explains why I've been feeling so out of control lately."
"I've been noticing that my ADHD symptoms are really bad around my period, and now I know it's not just me!"
"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by this new ADHD diagnosis, but at least I finally have some answers."

"It's hard to deal with SI, the bloating, headaches, and all the other unpleasant side effects are really taking a toll."
"Sometimes it's 3 days in a row, sometimes only 1 day, sometimes 2-3-4 times on different days. And it usually takes me by storm, I feel somewhat jittery or itchy inside, my thoughts are hard to catch and then I just break. Crying, screaming, feels like everything is so wrong, like everyone wants to hurt me somehow and I start pushing people away. But throughout those two weeks I also get paranoid thoughts, and they have been worsening with age...I listen to every sound, get really jumpy and I go to check if the door is really really locked like 5 times (Everytime I get up from bed after turning the light off)."
"I feel like a ticking time bomb, sometimes the fuse is long, sometimes it's short, but eventually, the explosion happens."
"It's like my emotions are on a roller coaster, sometimes it's a gentle ride, sometimes it's a wild, terrifying plunge."
"The feeling builds up, then it bursts, I can't control it, it's like a dam breaking."
"It's not just sadness, it's a whole whirlwind of emotions, fear, anger, helplessness, it all comes crashing down at once."
"I try to hold it together, but it's like trying to hold back a flood, eventually, everything breaks."
I've had PMDD since I was 14 and it's completely destroyed my life. I've been in and out of hospitals constantly and had to get on disability because I can't function and I'm unable to keep myself safe

I just feel completely lost and overwhelmed. I don't even know why I'm doing anything anymore.
Everything feels so pointless today. I'm exhausted and just want to disappear.
I'm drowning in these thoughts and I don't know how to get out. Maybe therapy is the answer.
I just want someone to understand how I'm feeling. I'm so tired of battling these intrusive thoughts.
I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I need to find a way to feel more connected to myself and my purpose.
I feel like I notice my PMDD symptoms sometimes an entire two weeks before the first day of my period and it gets progressively worse
"My PMDD symptoms start so early, I can feel them coming on a full two weeks before my period even starts."
It's frustrating because my PMDD symptoms start getting worse and worse in the two weeks leading up to my period.
"I wish I could ignore it, but my PMDD symptoms are so noticeable, I feel them for two weeks before my period even starts."
"The worst part is that my PMDD symptoms get progressively worse the closer I get to my period, and I can feel them coming on a full two weeks before it starts."

Stress is seriously making my periods so much worse.
"It feels like every time I'm stressed, my period comes a week early."
I'm so over the constant ups and downs with my period because of stress.
I wish there was a way to get rid of the stress so my period would be more regular.
I wanted to die... Currently I want others to die... I would rather not be suicidal.

"I'm trapped in this cycle of hatred and pain, I don't know how to escape."
"I'm tired of fighting, but I can't bring myself to give up."
I wonder if I’ll even get accepted or if I’ll even be able to handle the course load. I’m also just dreading change and feeling like there’s nothing good to look forward to. I feel absolutely no optimism about anything at all. It just feels like I have to exert effort existing
I'm so nervous about this new chapter. It feels like a huge leap into the unknown and I don't know if I'm ready.
Everything feels so uncertain right now. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff and I'm afraid to take the plunge.
It's hard to even muster up the motivation to try. I just feel stuck and like I'm going through the motions.
"I know I should be excited, but I just can't shake this feeling of dread. It's like a dark cloud is hanging over me."

I get so ridiculously depressed and if it gets really bad sometimes so suicidal my friends need to watch over me.

"I was lucky... After 6 months I was at my doctor's with months of data. I walked out with a diagnosis and an Rx. ...Then it turned outward. I do everything I can to stop it and swing it back at me. I go into full blown psychosis some months. I’m not me. Truly, I’m riding passenger while some crazy cunt with knowledge of all my loved ones secrets, buttons and fears is driving my body. ...My cycle is at least consistent: I can plan for it and give warning. ...Then this morning? A full on bleed. And the rage… I normally am pretty free of the rage when the tide unleashes… but this time? This is new? What fresh hell is this? Do I need hormones? Back on meds? I can’t do this every two weeks. I just can’t."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting a losing battle, and the rage just keeps getting worse."
"This cycle is exhausting, and I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever find a way to manage it."
"It's like my body is betraying me, and I have no control over what it does."
"I'm scared of what will happen next, and I don't know if I can handle it."
"I need help, but I don't know where to turn."
"I have noticed twice or now that out of nowhere my heart will beat very fast and then slowly drop down to normal within 4 minutes. I first noticed in Jan 2023 and my HR went to 160 and came back down within a few minutes I think. And now in today July 11, 2024 I noticed it again."
"I've experienced this rapid heartbeat twice now, once in January and again today. It's quite alarming, as my heart rate shoots up and then gradually returns to normal within a few minutes."

"I'm feeling so lazy, I just want to eat unhealthy food and stay in bed all day."
It's so hard to stick to my diet with all this delicious junk food around.
"Maybe if I could just have a little bit of junk food, I'd feel better about myself."
"I know I should be exercising and eating healthy, but I just can't seem to motivate myself."
It's frustrating to feel like I'm constantly battling my own willpower.
"2 days before estimated period arrival and I went into work just to go home 2 hours after my shift begun. I really did try all day to tell myself I could do it but it’s just unbearable. I just feel so worthless for not being able to finish my shift. I have a 12 hour shift on monday, not sure how I will manage but hopefully I will. Not sure how much more of living this way I can take. I just want to be okay."
"I'm feeling so defeated right now. I tried to push through my shift, but I just couldn't handle it. I feel like a failure for not being able to do my job."
I'm exhausted and my body is just giving up on me. I don't know how I'm going to manage my 12-hour shift on Monday. I just need to feel better.
This constant struggle is taking a toll on me. I feel like I'm living on autopilot. I just want to be able to function normally again.
I'm starting to think I'm not strong enough to handle this. I'm overwhelmed and my mind is racing. I need to find a way to cope.
This isn't sustainable. I'm at my breaking point. I need to figure out a way to get back on track before it's too late.

When you lose the home of the person you love who died. It feels like an insult to injury. I went through this exact grief in 2016. My grandma was forced to move out of her serene cottage when she became disabled with bell’s palsy after getting very sick with shingles.

I'm laughing through my pain for real....!!😹💘 (Even though I'm still upset about it🥲💔)
"I'm trying to stay positive, even though I'm really hurting inside."
"I'm putting on a brave face, but this is killing me."
"I'm pretending to be okay, but I'm actually falling apart."
"I'm forcing myself to laugh, but I'm still so sad."
"I'm trying to find the humor in this, but it's hard to see past the pain."
i'm still crying about it almost a week later
I can't believe I'm still thinking about it days later.
It's been a few days and I still feel so sad about it.
"Even a week later, I can't shake this feeling of disappointment."
"I'm still so upset about it, I can't even focus on anything else."
"The thought of it still makes me want to cry, even after all this time."

Today is absolutely terrible.
This day has been a complete disaster.
Everything is going wrong today.
I can't believe how awful today has been.
I'm having the worst day ever.
my dark side of the fucking moon doesn't know it
"My darkest secret is hidden deep within me, even I don't fully understand it."
"The shadow within me is so profound, even I am unaware of its true nature."
"There's a part of me that I've never explored, a hidden abyss of emotions that I can't even fathom."
"A part of me remains shrouded in mystery, even to my own eyes."
"I have a side that I keep hidden, a dark corner of my soul that even I haven't fully discovered."
I have been feeling. I have some questions tho as I’m starting to do research on this and learn more about it... so many emotions are going through my head rn. I’m hoping there’s some moms out there that can give me advice:
I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the information I'm finding.  I need to talk to some other moms who've been through this.
"I'm really trying to understand this, but it's bringing up so many emotions.  I just need someone to talk to."
This is all so new to me. I don't know where to start or who to ask for help.
I'm getting lost in all the different opinions and advice. I need some guidance from someone who knows what they're doing.
I'm feeling really anxious about this.  I just need to talk to someone who understands.
i didn’t care if i or anything else in my life ceased to exist... i was so hopeless and worthless... i had mentally gone through in such a short amount of time... i was acting towards myself like i was on a quick path towards ruining myself and my life in a really bad way.
"I felt like I was in freefall, with no hope of stopping or slowing down."
I was so consumed by despair that I didn't even care about the consequences of my actions.
"My self-destructive thoughts were spiraling out of control, and I felt powerless to stop them."
"It felt like I was on a fast track to self-destruction, and I couldn't see any way out."
"I was convinced that I was beyond saving, and that my life was destined for ruin."
I’m so tired of being up till 5 fucking am every night.
I'm exhausted from staying up so late every night.
I can't handle waking up at 5 am after staying up so late.
I'm completely drained from constantly going to bed so late.
I'm sick of being tired all the time because of my late nights.
I need to find a way to get to bed earlier so I can actually function during the day.

"the brain fog is HORRIBLE. I feel like I shouldn’t even drive. I hit curbs before but it ONLY has happened during luteal… I always respond with “I said that?”. I feel like I am constantly just floating and I don’t truly process what I am saying, what’s going on, etc."
"I'm so foggy-brained, it's terrifying, I almost ran a red light today."

"I feel like I'm in a fog, unable to think clearly or focus."
"PMDD has affected everything such as my relationships, work ethic, and has overall made me more moody/depressed than normal. With my ex, I constantly felt the need to break up with him around the time of my period... I felt so bad but told him it's because of my attachment style + pmdd and he's been accepting of it. This month, I have been feeling extreme anxiety about him... Sometimes when I'm with him, it reappears and I just feel like I'm losing my mind because I just want to be calm. Today, I woke up with extreme anxiety and border line hyperventilating when thinking about him and I'm just so upset that I have to deal with this."
"PMDD has impacted my ability to maintain stable relationships, and it's really challenging to manage my emotions and anxieties around the time of my period."
"I feel like PMDD has made me a different person sometimes, like I'm not even myself, and it's really hard to deal with the emotional rollercoaster."
"The anxiety and mood swings caused by PMDD are so intense that it feels like I'm constantly on edge, especially in relationships."
"It's frustrating because I know the anxiety and emotional instability are due to PMDD, but it still feels real and overwhelming, making it difficult to function."

I’ve been doing relatively well with my PMDD management
I've been managing my PMDD symptoms pretty well.
I've been finding ways to cope with my PMDD that are working for me.
My PMDD isn't as debilitating as it used to be.
I've been able to keep my PMDD under control.
I'm feeling more in control of my PMDD these days.
I'm just really sexually frustrated. I don't want to lash out and take it out on him because in general it doesn't really matter.. I feel like shit cause I just told my therapist about him and I feel embarrassed

the hormonal changes in the luteal phase does cause me to use the restroom more often
The hormonal changes during the luteal phase make me need to use the bathroom more frequently.
My increased bathroom trips in the luteal phase are definitely due to the hormonal shifts.
"I've noticed that I go to the bathroom a lot more often during the luteal phase, and I know it's because of the hormones."
It's frustrating how the hormonal fluctuations during the luteal phase make me need to pee so much.
"The luteal phase really messes with my bladder, I'm constantly running to the bathroom."
"I get itchy like not in any specific spot, but my whole body feels like it’s crawling? Or like the first layer of skin just like feels hot and stings sometimes."

I've been so angry lately that I've thought about doing things I would never actually do.
It's scary how much anger can build up inside you until you feel like you might explode.
"I've had to find ways to release the anger because it's consuming me, like I'm going crazy."
"I'm so frustrated and overwhelmed that I can't even think straight, let alone make rational decisions."
I've reached a point where I need to find help because I can't keep bottling up all this rage.

"I feel like I'm constantly striving for perfection, but I never feel like I'm good enough, especially when it comes to my intelligence."

My differential diagnosis is all the above and also include BPD traits…. 
My working diagnosis is a combination of all of the above and also includes some features of Borderline Personality Disorder.
"I'm considering several diagnoses, including all of the possibilities we've discussed, as well as the potential for Borderline Personality Disorder traits."

I feel a bit clear eyed in an unsentimental way - the problems that exist the whole cycle are laid bare... I feel that I can trust my feelings a bit more in luteal now which is oddly comforting? The problems are always there but I am more exposed to them in a raw way without the cushion of positive emotions I get in follicular.
"I'm seeing things more clearly, even if it's not always a pretty picture. It's like the filter is off and I'm facing reality head-on."
"The luteal phase feels more honest, even if it's not always comfortable. It's a raw exposure to my problems, without the rose-colored glasses of the follicular phase."
"I'm not sure I like the clarity of the luteal phase, but it's real. I can't deny my problems, even if they feel a bit overwhelming."
"I'm learning to trust my feelings more in the luteal phase, even if they're not always positive. It's a kind of honesty I appreciate, even if it's a little scary."
"The luteal phase is like looking in the mirror without makeup. It's a bit brutal, but it's also a chance for real self-reflection."
"The anxiety is severe, pmdd distress plus anxiety."
"I'm feeling incredibly anxious, it's probably the PMDD combined with general anxiety."

Every morning I wake up feeling like I'm caught in a cycle of fatigue and aches.
"The flu symptoms have been relentless – chills, aches, and exhaustion."
"I feel like I've been battling the flu for days, with no relief in sight."
The constant chills and muscle aches have made it feel like I'm stuck in a flu-ridden nightmare.
my breasts are still sore as if i’m in luteal...and i’m still an emotional fucking wreck! usually i would feel relief from the symptoms by now but it’s almost like my body is confused as to why i haven’t bled yet??
"My body is just not cooperating this month, everything feels so off."
I'm starting to think this is going to be one of those cycles where I feel like this forever.

"I can't believe how much my emotions are all over the place, it's like a roller coaster."

"I feel like when I have sick days due to PMDD symptoms and go off grid for a few days, I come back to work and feel very judged and ashamed and feel like I have to be extra strong and confident to make up for their judgements of me not being at work. When I’m back to feeling “Okay” again I feel like other people might think I was faking being unwell as I come back like nothing happened sort of thing. I feel so overwhelmed and disgusted with myself and don’t want anyone to see me when I’m feeling vulnerable. I feel like a whole demon has taken over your body"
"I hate feeling like I have to pretend everything is fine when I'm still recovering, it feels like I'm letting people down and making them think I was faking it all along."

"It's incredibly frustrating to have to deal with the stigma surrounding mental health, especially when it feels like everyone is questioning your authenticity."
I suspect I have PMDD and she just offers me antidepressants or to change my birth control but has never officially diagnosed me.. not really sure what I am expecting out of being officially diagnosed but I guess it would make me feel less crazy to know there’s a legit reason why I act so unlike myself around my period :( 
"I feel like I'm going crazy during my period, and I'm so frustrated that my doctor doesn't seem to take me seriously."
"It's really hard to deal with these extreme mood swings around my period, and I just want to know what's happening to me."
"I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one who goes through this, and I wish my doctor would just listen to me and offer some real help."
"I don't know what kind of treatment I'm looking for, but I just want to know that there's a medical explanation for what I'm going through."

i had to write an essay on pmdd...it makes me feel guilty about having pmdd and hurt that we’re not being taken seriously by our own sisters.
"It's frustrating that people don't understand PMDD, even other women."
I feel like I'm constantly explaining myself and my experience with PMDD.
It's exhausting to have to constantly fight for recognition and validation for PMDD.
I wish people would listen to us and take our concerns about PMDD seriously.
I'm tired of being dismissed and told that my PMDD isn't real.

I'm expecting my period both today and in two weeks.
"My period is supposed to start today, but it's also possible it's delayed two weeks."
"I have a feeling my period might be due today, but it could also be in two weeks."
It's confusing because my period could come today or in two weeks.
"I'm not sure when to expect my period, it could be today or in two weeks."
My pmdd symptoms eb and flow depending on the month. This time around they are feeling pretty severe. I was up all night with anxiety. Self-sabotaging. Convincing myself I just shouldn’t go. Or the anxiety will be so bad on the drive up I won’t make it. That my anxiety will be so bad on the trip I’ll have a panic attack and ruin everything. That I’ll cry in front of everyone.
"The ups and downs of PMDD are so unpredictable, it's like riding a rollercoaster of emotions."
"This month, my PMDD symptoms have been particularly intense, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and anxious."
"I spent the whole night tossing and turning, my mind racing with worries and fears."
"It's hard to shake the feeling that I'm going to ruin everything, especially when the anxiety is so strong."
The thought of facing the crowd and the possibility of having a panic attack makes me want to just stay home.
"my mood swings, they always come in at full force and smack me into the worst depression and anger. ... I want to end it all, despite knowing this is temporary it’s like, is it really tho? Temporary until next time and then what? I have to try and talk myself down ? Every single month for the rest of my life ???"
"My mood swings are like a roller coaster, taking me from highs to lows in a blink of an eye."
"It feels like my emotions are on a timer, ticking down to the next wave of intense sadness and frustration."
"The darkness of depression hits me so hard, it feels like it'll last forever, even though I know it's temporary."

"I was so angry about not getting those hash browns, it was unreal."
I felt like I was going to explode because I didn't have those hash browns.
It's crazy how my emotions can go from zero to a hundred like that.
"I'm not sure what came over me, I was seriously angry about those hash browns."
"I'm a bit scared of myself sometimes, because my anger can be so intense."
"I've had 9 nights of hot flushes, a migraine, my period has come and gone... and nothing is working."
"I'm feeling awful, my body is rebelling against me, and I just want it to stop."
"I've tried everything, but nothing seems to make a difference. I'm exhausted."
"My body feels like it's on fire, my head is pounding, and I'm just so over it."
It's like my body is going through some kind of hormonal warzone and I'm just stuck in the middle.
"I can't even explain how I feel, it's just a whole lot of discomfort and frustration."
I hate everyone. I want to watch the world burn. I might even cancel a date I have tomorrow.
I feel so angry and alone. Everything is awful.
I don't want to be part of this world anymore. It's all going downhill.
I don't even care about my own life anymore. I'm just so numb.
I can't even bring myself to be happy for other people. It's like they're living in a different reality.
I feel like I'm going to explode. Everything is just so frustrating.
I’m deep in PMDD- 6 days out from my period. I couldn’t do the damn game right and ended up sobbing and leaving. I am so embarrassed and I can’t believe I did that. My worst fear is people thinking I’m crazy.
"I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I couldn't function, and I ended up making a scene. I'm so ashamed of myself."
I'm going through a really rough patch right now and it made me act out of character. I'm so sorry for how I acted.

I'm having a really hard time right now and I'm struggling to keep it together. I feel so vulnerable and exposed.
My emotions are completely out of whack right now and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm so scared that people will think I'm unstable.
I told her about my issues with dark thoughts and severe depression around my period. ... it was about my mental health. ... I don’t even think she noted down my thoughts in the chart.
"I shared my struggles with dark thoughts and severe depression during my period, but she didn't seem to take it seriously."

"It's all too much - the sensory overload, the pain, the DPDR, the inability to plan. I just have to wait for the hormone therapy to start working."
"I can't even think about making plans because everything feels so unbearable. The pain, the DPDR, the sensory overload, it's all too much."
"I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of unbearable sensations. The pain, the DPDR, the sensory overload, it's all too much."

"For me, I know Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Dopa Mucuna, Adderall, certain caffeine, some mushrooms, some B vitamins, some prescriptions make everything spiral. Things that have helped are healthy fats like salmon, eggs, and avocado. Supplements magnesium, D3+K12, krill oil, multivitamin, passionflower, CoQ10. I have Mirena, which has helped. I take Welbutrin X150, which has also helped."

I'm constantly battling a combination of debilitating anxiety and sudden surges of motivation.
"every single month, around days 16-18 of my cycle when i enter luteal , ill have a day or two that’s really really awful. for a while i didn’t even connect the dots to PMDD but in recent months, during this 3 day period, i SWEAR TO GOD, i can feel my eggs being released and my uterus cramps like crazy."
"I've noticed that every month, right around days 16-18 of my cycle, I experience a couple of really terrible days."

I just want to stay in bed all day.

I'm in such a mood where I just want to be left alone.
"Talking to anyone feels like a chore right now, I can't even deal."
I'm so drained that even a simple conversation feels exhausting.
"My social battery is completely dead, I need some serious alone time."
I'm feeling really introverted and just need to recharge.
"I still have poor sleep, rumination and crying spells"
"I'm still struggling with insomnia, obsessive thoughts, and frequent crying episodes."

This loneliness is unbearable.
I'm so tired of being by myself.
I wish I had someone to talk to.
It's hard to be happy when you feel this alone.
"I can remember on multiple occasions where I was suicidal and considered and made plans to follow through with, and I’ve begun to not trust myself alone not to do things I know I could harm myself with. These periods often last 1-3 weeks before my period, and after it starts I’m good to go, like none of it happened. This time has been especially hard for me, and I also had some other stressful things going on that added onto the depression, and it got so bad I relapsed from SH which really affected me."
"I have a history of suicidal thoughts and actions, and I'm struggling to trust myself to stay safe when I'm alone."
"The intense suicidal feelings usually hit me for a few weeks before my period, and then I feel completely normal again, which is both confusing and terrifying."
"This time has been particularly difficult because of the added stress from other issues, and I ended up relapsing into self-harm, which has been incredibly damaging."
"It's hard to explain the cycle of feeling suicidal, then fine, then feeling suicidal again, especially when I don't know what triggers it."
"The fact that I can go from feeling completely normal to wanting to harm myself in a matter of weeks is a huge burden, and I'm scared of what might happen next."
ive been trying to bury everything down for so long
I've been trying to ignore everything that's been bothering me.
I've been pushing my problems away for a long time.
I've been trying to pretend everything is okay.
I've been holding everything inside for too long.
I've been trying to keep my feelings bottled up.
This feels like a life vest on the open ocean today.
This feels like a lifeline in a chaotic storm.
This feels like a beacon of hope in a world of darkness.
This feels like a comforting embrace in a sea of uncertainty.
This feels like a safe haven amidst the turbulence of life.
This feels like a moment of peace in a world of constant motion.
I'm crying. I feel these words in my heart. It's like these words came from my soul.
"These words resonate deeply within me, as if they were born from my own being."
"The words touch me so deeply, they feel like they're echoing from my soul."
I'm overwhelmed with emotion. It's as if these words are a reflection of my own inner thoughts and feelings.
"These words hold such power, they feel like they've come straight from my heart."
"It's as if these words were meant for me, they speak to my soul in a way nothing else can."
feeling really suicidal lately
I've been struggling with really dark thoughts lately.
I feel like I'm at my breaking point.
"Life has been so hard, I don't even know if I can keep going."
I'm constantly thinking about ending it all.
It feels like there's no point to anything anymore.
I think pmdd is so very very isolating and hard to understand for anyone who doesn't suffer from it and I felt a gratitude and visibility to hear this from someone KNowing that you understand the desperation and despair it holds over us.
"PMDD is incredibly isolating and hard for anyone to understand who hasn't experienced it firsthand. It was such a relief to hear someone who gets it, someone who understands the hopelessness and despair."
"I'm so grateful for someone who understands the depth of PMDD. It's a condition that feels so lonely and isolating, and it's hard to explain to people who don't experience it."
"I've never felt so seen and understood as I did when I heard you talk about PMDD. It's a struggle that often feels invisible, so to have someone acknowledge the desperation and despair is incredibly validating."
"It's so hard to find people who understand the true nature of PMDD. It's often dismissed or minimized, so to hear someone who knows the pain and suffering it brings is truly comforting."
I feel like I've been carrying this burden of PMDD alone for so long. Hearing someone speak about it with such understanding and empathy makes me feel less alone.

I'm too tired to get up.
I'm feeling really weak and I can't move.

My body is aching so much I can't even move.
"When you think 'I should be having a great time, I am capable of doing all I want because this is my life', but all you feel like doing is crying. It's like you cannot fully appreciate what you have around you, you're grateful but it's like that happiness can't reach your heart. Like there is barrier you can't get a grasp on."
"You know you should be happy, you have everything you want, but you just can't shake this feeling of emptiness."
"I'm surrounded by love and support, but I feel so alone, like I can't connect with my own joy."
"It's like there's a wall between me and happiness, I can see it but I can't reach it."
"I'm grateful for all that I have, but it doesn't feel like enough, there's this constant longing for something more."
"My life is good, I have everything I could ask for, but I still feel this deep sadness I can't explain."
"Last time I was ovulating...I experienced a very happy, confident almost euphoric state which I must admit LOVED. I was the happiest, most confident, felt the sexiest I've ever felt. Was more social and everything good in between...but it still felt soooo good!"
"I felt an incredible surge of energy and positivity during ovulation, like I could conquer the world!"
"It's amazing how ovulation can make you feel so alive and vibrant, full of energy and joy."
"I felt so powerful and confident during my ovulation period, it was like a whole new me!"
"The happiness and confidence I felt during ovulation were simply incredible, it was like a burst of pure joy."

I'm sorry these thoughts come to you and consume your head. Find strength in knowing you're not the only one. It is unfair that our minds run at 100 miles an hour and we have to be functional people 😑
"I understand that it's hard to deal with intrusive thoughts, especially when they feel overwhelming."
It's not fair that we have to constantly battle these negative thoughts while trying to live our lives.
"It's frustrating that our brains can be so chaotic, especially when we need to focus and be productive."
I wish there was a way to turn off these thoughts and just have some peace of mind.
"Remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are ways to cope and manage these thoughts."
I thought I was the only one and they were causing so much panic
I felt so isolated and their actions were causing a lot of stress.
"I was completely unaware that others were going through the same thing, and their behavior was making me very anxious."
"I assumed I was the only one struggling, and their behavior was generating a lot of fear and uncertainty."
"It seemed like I was the only one experiencing this, and their actions were creating a lot of chaos."

Most of my intrusive thoughts are essentially ‘am I pregnant?! I’m definitely pregnant. Better take a test and check it with a negative filter just in case I can’t see the positive line with the naked eye. Is that a line?! Fuck IS THAT A LINE’
"I can't stop thinking about whether I've forgotten to do something important, like locking the door or turning off the stove. It's like a little voice in my head constantly nagging me to double check everything."
"I keep replaying conversations in my head, dissecting every word and trying to figure out what I could have said differently.  It's exhausting, but I can't help it."
"My mind keeps jumping to the worst possible scenarios, even when there's no reason to worry. I know it's irrational, but I can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen."
"I keep imagining myself saying something embarrassing in public, or doing something foolish that everyone will laugh at. It makes me want to hide away from the world."
"I can't stop thinking about all the things I need to do, and it feels like there's never enough time in the day.  I'm constantly stressed and anxious, even when I'm not actually busy."
spiraling intrusive thoughts occur more often than just during luteal
Spiraling intrusive thoughts don't only happen during the luteal phase; they can appear at any time.
"My intrusive thoughts are relentless, even outside of the luteal phase."
The luteal phase isn't the only trigger for these overwhelming intrusive thoughts.
I experience these intrusive thought spirals not only during the luteal phase but throughout the month.
"The luteal phase might be a common trigger, but I'm constantly battling these intrusive thought spirals."
My brain starts to softly say “go k*ll yourself” about a week after my period. Then it gets louder and louder until I bleed again! 
My body's been feeling off all week and my brain's been telling me to just give up.
"This week, I've been feeling so low and my brain is constantly telling me to just end it all."
"Every month, I feel like my whole world falls apart and my brain starts screaming at me to just disappear."
The week after my period is always the worst.  I feel like I'm going crazy and my brain is just constantly telling me to do something terrible.

I'm surrounded by people who are secretly plotting against me and trying to make me suffer.

"For the first time in forever, I don't feel like I'm the only one struggling with this."

I'm thinking these thoughts
I'm wrestling with these ideas.
These thoughts are swirling in my head.
My mind is buzzing with these ideas.
These thoughts are occupying my attention.
These thoughts are bouncing around in my head.
"I have so many intrusive thoughts... (“I’m a loser”, “everyone hates me”, “I’m going to die alone” or whatever), rather than a depression symptom."
"I feel like I'm constantly bombarded with negative thoughts, like 'I'm not good enough' or 'I'm going to fail', and it's exhausting."
"My mind is a whirlwind of self-doubt and negativity, with thoughts like 'I'm a burden' or 'I'm not worthy' constantly looping in my head."
"It's like I have this inner critic that's always whispering terrible things in my ear, things like 'You're not smart enough' or 'You're going to screw everything up'."
"I can't seem to escape the endless stream of negative self-talk, like 'I'm a failure' or 'I'm going to be alone forever'."
"I feel like my brain is constantly replaying these horrible scenarios, like 'I'm going to get fired' or 'Everyone is going to abandon me', and it's driving me crazy."
exhausting

Günlük hayatımın temposu çok yorucu.
"Bu kadar çok iş, insanı gerçekten yoruyor."
Sürekli koşuşturmaca beni tamamen yordu.
Uzun bir günün ardından çok yorgun hissediyorum.
"I am literally up being paranoid that someone is in my house because the kitchen door wasn’t completely locked. Feeling guilty for every time I’ve been with anyone, feeling like I don’t ever want to be with anyone again yet feeling incredibly lonely and just craving head pats and hugs and cuddles and someone comforting me to sleep"
"I'm so anxious about the unlocked door, it's making me think about all the times I've been vulnerable with people, and now I just want to be alone but also desperately crave affection and someone to hold me."
"My paranoia is spiraling out of control because of that slightly ajar door, and I can't help but feel like I've made bad choices in the past, leaving me wanting to isolate myself but also craving comfort and connection."
"The unlocked kitchen door has my mind racing with insecurities about my past relationships, and now I feel trapped in this cycle of wanting to be alone yet yearning for closeness and someone to reassure me."
"I'm on edge because of the unlocked door, and it's making me question everything about my past, my present, and my future, leaving me wanting to be independent but also desperately needing a hug and someone to tell me everything will be okay."
"This unlocked door is triggering so many emotions, making me feel both isolated and desperate for connection, like I need someone to hold me and reassure me that everything is going to be alright."
I’ve had an awfully rough week and reading this made me feel so seen and validated.
"This week has been really tough, but this made me feel like someone finally understood what I'm going through."
"I've been going through a lot lately, and this really resonated with me."
"I needed to hear this today. It's been a challenging week, but this gave me some much-needed validation."

"I've been feeling lost and alone, but this made me feel like I'm not the only one going through this."
"The intrusive thoughts are so difficult to manage, and then it becomes even more complicated when you cannot freaking calm the mind down. It is an absolutely BIZARRE experience to completely lose sight of oneself one week (or two because lately mine has been ovulation as well) a month."
"The constant influx of unwanted thoughts makes it nearly impossible to focus, and then the inability to quiet my mind just makes everything worse."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling against these intrusive thoughts, and then the anxiety of not being able to relax just amplifies everything."
"It's such a struggle to control these intrusive thoughts, and then the added pressure of not being able to calm down just makes it unbearable."
"The intrusive thoughts are so overwhelming, and then the inability to find peace and quiet just makes it feel like I'm losing myself."

"These thoughts have been my constant companion, but I never knew if anyone else could relate."
"42yrs old. Just got my hysterectomy and oophorectomy (uterus and ovaries removed)  2 months ago, and I no longer have these thoughts anymore. Honestly, in hind sight PMDD is way worse than we think it is."
"I'm so relieved to be free from PMDD, it was a constant struggle."
My hysterectomy and oophorectomy were the best decisions I ever made.
"Before the surgery, I was constantly feeling overwhelmed and anxious, but now I feel like a new person."
"Looking back, I realize just how much PMDD impacted my life, it was much more debilitating than I thought."
"I wish I had gotten the surgery sooner, I would have saved myself so much stress and pain."
waits in bed for the earthquake to come*unplugs all the cords*
"The earthquake hasn't come yet, but I'm ready, just in case.  All the cords are unplugged, I'm in bed, and I'm just waiting."
"I can't relax until the earthquake is over, so I'm just lying here in bed, waiting, and making sure everything is unplugged."

"Aklımı sürekli olarak rahatsız eden düşüncelerle mücadele ediyorum, tıpkı bir OCD döngüsünde takılıp kalmış gibi."

I'm having a moment of complete mental chaos.
"My mind is playing tricks on me, it feels like I'm losing it."
"This is all getting so weird and out of control, it's like my mind is on drugs."
I always feel like the most indecisive person because I can have completely opposite thoughts and most of the time they both feel valid in that moment.
"I'm constantly torn between two very different opinions, and it feels like I can't choose between them."
I have a hard time making decisions because I always have two opposing viewpoints that seem equally convincing.

"i sometimes feel like men will never understand the depth and emotions people who have a uterus feel and go through, and then i question if i dated a woman if there would be a better level of compassion/understanding"
I often find myself wondering if women have a better understanding of the emotional experiences of those who menstruate.
It makes me wonder if I would feel more understood and supported by a partner who has also experienced menstruation.
"Sometimes I feel like men just don't get it, you know? The way my body and emotions are connected to my cycle."
It's frustrating to feel like my experiences are dismissed because I'm a woman.
I just wish there was more empathy and awareness around the physical and emotional aspects of having a uterus.
Intrusive thoughts are the worst. This month has been the worst in a while for that.
Benim için zorlayıcı geçen günler oldu.
Son birkaç aydır kendimi huzursuz hissediyorum.
Duygusal olarak gerçekten zor bir zamandan geçiyorum.
Kendimi sürekli olarak düşüncelerimin esiri gibi hissediyorum.
Bu durumla başa çıkmak gerçekten çok zor.
"I applied for 3 positions and almost quit my job for no reason last week. This week, my actual period, I feel like myself just with horrible cramps that disable me and bring me to tears.. smh."
"I'm so stressed about job hunting, I'm actually having a breakdown this week."

"It's just not fair, I'm trying my best and it feels like nothing is working out."
Obsessively argued with the mechanic for 40 mins about him charging me for fitting a new bulb when I already paid £300….
"The mechanic tried to charge me an extra £10 for putting a new bulb in, even after I'd paid £300 for the whole repair!"
I was arguing with the mechanic for ages because he wanted to charge me for something I thought was already included in the price.
"I can't believe he tried to charge me extra for fitting the bulb, I was already paying a fortune for the service!"
"I was completely baffled, why did he try to charge me for a simple bulb after I already paid a large sum?"
"He insisted on charging me an extra £10 for the bulb, it felt like he was trying to nickel and dime me after all that money I spent."
"I start to think about dreading the next day. If that makes sense. Like I think 'oh no, the next day is near and I have to go through those hours' Thinking this thought activates anxiety/impending doom."
I'm starting to feel that familiar dread about tomorrow.
The thought of facing another day fills me with anxiety.
Just thinking about what tomorrow holds makes my stomach churn.
I can already feel the weight of the next day pressing down on me.
The anticipation of tomorrow is already making me feel stressed.
I feel this so much
I understand exactly how you feel.
This really resonates with me.
"I've been there, I know how you feel."
This is something I can relate to on a personal level.
I feel this deeply.
intrusive thoughts. I could have written this same list. It’s exhausting.
I'm so tired of my brain constantly coming up with these ideas.
It's frustrating that I'm always thinking about things I could have done differently.
I feel like I'm constantly second-guessing myself and my decisions.
I just want to stop overthinking everything for once.
It feels like I'm always battling against my own mind.
it’s like my brain tries to attack itself
My thoughts are constantly battling each other.
It feels like I'm fighting against my own mind.
I'm constantly struggling with conflicting ideas.
My brain is in a constant state of internal warfare.
It's like there's a war going on inside my head.
One time I came this close to calling my engaged ex to meet me after my bf and I had a major fight during my luteal phase.
"I almost called my ex the other day, after a huge fight with my boyfriend, but I managed to catch myself."
"During my luteal phase, I was on edge and almost contacted my ex after a big argument with my current partner."
"I was so upset after our fight that I seriously considered reaching out to my ex-fiancé, but then I realized it was just a hormonal reaction."
"Hormones can be tricky. I almost called my ex after a fight with my boyfriend, even though we're engaged now."
"The urge to call my ex was so strong after a big fight with my boyfriend, but thankfully, I managed to hold back."
I'm embarrassing the fuck out of myself to my boyfriend because of it
I feel like a total fool in front of my boyfriend because of this.
"This is so humiliating, I can't believe I'm doing this in front of him."
"I'm so mortified right now, he's probably thinking I'm an idiot."
"I'm making a complete spectacle of myself, he must be cringing."
"I feel so awkward and embarrassed, I wish I could disappear."
intense thoughts
Derin düşünceler beni ele geçirdi.
Zihnimde yoğun bir düşünce fırtınası koptu.
Aklım sürekli olarak yoğun düşüncelerle meşguldü.
"Yüzeysel düşüncelerden öteye, derinlere inen yoğun bir düşünce süreci içindeydim."
"Yoğun düşünceler, zihnime bir ağırlık çökmesine neden oldu."
I think the worst every. single. time. Even though I get the genetic testing for it every year and it’s always negative. So I’m glad I’m not alone in that because it makes me feel pretty cuckoo
"It's the same thing every year, even with the genetic testing, and it makes me feel crazy."
"I get tested every year, and it's always negative, but I still feel like I'm the only one going through this."
"I feel so weird about this, even though the test is always negative, and it's reassuring to know I'm not alone."
"It's so frustrating, every single year, and it's making me feel a little crazy."
"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who feels this way, even though the test comes back negative every year."
I need to be put in a mental hospital
I'm not feeling well mentally and I need professional help.
"I think I'm going crazy, I need someone to help me."
"I'm having a breakdown, I need to go somewhere safe."
My thoughts are overwhelming and I need to be hospitalized.
"I'm not in control of my emotions, I need to be admitted to a mental institution."
my brain has been off the charts with the intrusive thoughts. I literally have atleast 90% of the same thought as you. I also get an ear worm that I can’t stop thinking in loops.
"My mind has been racing with intrusive thoughts lately, it's almost impossible to focus."
"I've been having a lot of the same thoughts as you, it's almost like we're on the same wavelength."
"I have this earworm stuck in my head, I can't stop thinking about it, it's driving me crazy."
"I'm constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts, it's like a never-ending loop."
"I feel like my mind is a jumbled mess of intrusive thoughts and earworms, it's hard to think straight."
thought spiraling is definitely one of my major symptoms of OCD. The thoughts make you feel so alone and like you’re the only one who thinks or feels this way. It’s alienating.
"Duygusal döngüler de benim OCD belirtilerimden biri, kendimi çok yalnız ve farklı hissetmeme sebep oluyor."
Bu düşünceler beni başkalarından ayırıyor ve dünyada tek başıma olduğumu hissettiriyor.
"Duyguların sürekli döngüye girmesi benim için dayanılmaz, sanki kendimden bile kopuyorum."
"O kadar garip düşüncelere kapılıyorum ki, bu düşüncelerin sadece benim başıma geldiğini ve başkalarının böyle bir şey yaşamadığını hissediyorum."
"Sanki içimde bir şey sürekli dönüyor, beni ve dış dünyayı birbirinden ayırıyor."
"I need to get moving and out of my head, but once I do, I still feel horrible. One wrong thing, jeans too tight or hair is laying down in a ""stupid"" way, and I just lose it."
"I need to clear my head and go for a walk, but then I just feel so stressed out."
"It's hard to shake off the anxiety, even when I'm trying to distract myself."
I can't seem to catch a break - one small thing goes wrong and I just feel like everything is falling apart.
"I'm so sensitive to my surroundings lately, and it's making me feel really overwhelmed."
"I just need to be able to relax and not worry about every little detail, but it feels impossible."
without PMDD as an explanation Im just a crazy person...or thats how I feel
"If I don't have PMDD, then I just seem crazy...that's what it feels like."
"Without a medical explanation like PMDD, I just come across as insane...or at least that's how it feels."
"Without PMDD as a reason for my behavior, people just think I'm nuts...that's what it feels like to me."
"If I don't have PMDD, I'm just a lunatic...or that's how it feels."
"Without PMDD as a diagnosis, I'm just perceived as crazy...or that's how it feels to me."
I have every single last one of those thoughts during my luteal phase
I've been having all the same doubts and anxieties every month during my luteal phase.
My luteal phase is always a time of intense emotions and negative thinking.
The constant stream of negative thoughts during my luteal phase is so draining.
It's like my brain is a broken record playing the same negative thoughts on loop during my luteal phase.
I feel like I'm going crazy with all these intrusive thoughts during my luteal phase.
I’m not able to function during luteal and menstruation
I'm feeling really drained and exhausted during my period.
My energy levels plummet during the luteal phase and menstruation.
I just can't seem to get anything done when I'm on my period.
I feel like I'm in a fog during the luteal phase and menstruation.
My body just shuts down during my period.
I am now throughly convinced that the guy I’m seeing... hasn’t called or texted me today because he doesn’t like me anymore... And I feel like a bad mother and an unlovable monster.
"I'm starting to think that maybe he just isn't interested in me anymore... He hasn't reached out at all today, and it's making me feel terrible about myself."
"This silence from him is killing me... I'm sure it's nothing, but I can't help but feel like he's lost interest."
"I've been trying to convince myself that it's just a busy day, but the truth is... I'm feeling really insecure about his lack of communication."
I hate the feeling that I'm not good enough... I'm starting to believe that maybe he's just not that into me.
"Why is he ignoring me? I'm overthinking everything now, and I just want him to reach out and tell me everything is okay."
I've convinced myself I'm emotionally cheating but it feels like it's my pmdd self doing it
"I feel like I'm emotionally cheating on my partner, but it's just my premenstrual dysphoric disorder acting up."
"I'm convinced that I'm being emotionally unfaithful, but it's my pmdd making me feel this way."
"It feels like I'm emotionally betraying my partner, but it's my pmdd messing with my head."
"I know I'm not really cheating, but my pmdd is making me feel like I am."
"I feel like I'm letting my partner down emotionally, but it's just my pmdd making me act out."
Are we the same person 😭
Are you sure we're not the same person?
"I feel like we're so much alike, it's scary."
Do you ever feel like you're looking in a mirror when you see me?
"We think so much alike, it's almost spooky."
"We're like two peas in a pod, don't you think?"
"I have some of these thoughts and others that are so much worse + more destructive when my body wants to menstruate, I consider ovary removal on a regular basis to end my PMDD"
"I feel like my body is betraying me during this time, and the only solution I can think of is to remove my ovaries."
"It's like my brain is hijacked by my hormones, and I can't think straight or act rationally."
The pain and emotional turmoil are so unbearable that I'm willing to go through the extreme measure of ovary removal.
I'm so desperate to find a way to end this monthly cycle of pain and suffering.
"I just want to feel normal again, and this constant struggle with my hormones is keeping me from living my life to the fullest."
i need to admit myself
I need to check myself into a hospital.
I'm going to seek professional help.
I need to go to a facility.
I need to get some treatment.
I need to get some help.
I get thought patterns of disappearing and moving internationally without a trace... Or that I’m the worst person imaginable and feeling guilty for existing bc I burden others. Or that I never do enough. And being endlessly frustrated... severe anxiety and hormonal downward spirals
"I get these thoughts about running away, vanishing, starting over somewhere new. Or that I'm a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be here, causing pain to those around me. Then there's the feeling of never being enough, never doing enough... endless frustration, overwhelming anxiety, and a sense of just spiraling downwards."
"Sometimes I feel like I could just disappear, vanish into thin air and start over somewhere else. Other times I feel like the worst person alive, guilty for even existing because I feel like a burden to others. Then there's the constant feeling of not doing enough, being endlessly frustrated... all of it culminating in intense anxiety and a sense of freefalling."
"I have these recurring thoughts about disappearing, moving to a new country and never looking back. Or that I'm the worst person in the world, deserving only guilt and shame for hurting the people I love. And then there's the feeling of never doing enough, never being enough... it's a constant cycle of frustration, anxiety, and feeling like I'm falling apart."
"I think about leaving everything behind, just disappearing and starting over somewhere new. Or I feel like the worst person imaginable, full of guilt for simply existing and burdening others. Then there's the feeling of inadequacy, of never being enough, never doing enough... and it's all accompanied by intense anxiety and a sense of falling apart."
"There's this thought in my head about just disappearing, moving to a different country and starting over. Or that I'm the worst person on the planet, causing pain and suffering to everyone around me. Then there's the constant feeling of never doing enough, never being enough... it's a vicious cycle of frustration, anxiety, and feeling like I'm spiraling out of control."
"racing, intrusive thoughts make me feel like I’m crawling in my own skin!!! Trapped in my mind. Rapid-fired negativity."
"Intrusive thoughts are making me feel like I'm going crazy, like I'm stuck in my own head."
"I can't escape these negative thoughts, they're constantly bombarding me."
"My mind is racing, filled with negativity, and it's driving me insane."
"I feel like I'm losing control, trapped in a whirlwind of my own thoughts."
"These intrusive thoughts are so overwhelming, I feel like I'm drowning in my own mind."
i feel this so much
I understand exactly how you feel.
This resonates with me deeply.
"I've been there, I know what you mean."
I feel the same way.
This hits close to home.
intrusive thoughts
İstemsiz ve istenmeyen düşüncelerin aklımı işgal etmesi beni rahatsız ediyor.
"Kontrol edemediğim, rahatsız edici düşünceler zihnimde yankılanıyor."
"Aklımda sürekli tekrar eden, istenmeyen düşüncelerle boğuşuyorum."
Gerektiğinde gelen ama gitmesi gereken düşüncelerle savaş veriyorum.
"Zihnimin derinliklerinden gelen, istemsiz ve rahatsız edici düşüncelerle başa çıkmak zorunda kalıyorum."
I have ROCD and I have these thoughts too. But I noticed they always happen to be exacerbated during the week before my period.
My ROCD symptoms always seem to get worse the week before my period.
I've noticed a strong correlation between my period and the intensity of my ROCD thoughts.
It's like my ROCD goes into overdrive in the days leading up to my period.
The week before my period is always the hardest for me when it comes to my ROCD.
I wonder if there's a hormonal connection between my period and my ROCD.
"she hate me, she's planning my demise"
"She doesn't want me around, she's trying to get rid of me."
"She's out to get me, she's plotting my downfall."
"She's angry, she wants to see me suffer."
"She's threatened by me, she's trying to eliminate me."
"She's obsessed with destroying me, she's driven by revenge."
I was sobbing and apologizing to my bunnies
"I felt so bad for scaring them, I was practically begging for forgiveness."
My heart was breaking as I realized how much I'd upset them.
"I couldn't believe I'd made them so scared, I just wanted to hold them and make everything alright."
"I was so choked up with guilt, all I could do was cry and say sorry."
"The thought of them being sad because of me was unbearable, I just wanted to make it up to them."
My OCD gets 10x worse around this time
My anxiety always spikes around this time of year.
I feel so much more on edge these days.
I'm constantly checking and re-checking everything.
I can't seem to shake this feeling of unease.
I'm having a hard time focusing and getting things done.
I’ve been thinking I have cancer every cycle for years... I’m gonna freak out so many times again.
I can't help but feel like I'm going to have a panic attack every time the symptoms come back.
This recurring fear of cancer is going to drive me crazy.
It's like my mind is constantly playing this terrible scenario over and over.
"This anxiety is going to be so overwhelming, I know it."
I can't believe I'm going to have to go through this again.
It’s so exhausting
I'm completely drained.
"I'm so tired, I could sleep for a week."
I feel like I've run a marathon.
This is taking all my energy.
"I need a break, I'm completely worn out."
Giving birth was traumatic and a big fear
Doğum deneyimi çok travmatik ve korkutucuydu.
Çocuğumu doğurmak hayatımın en zorlu ve korkunç deneyimlerinden biriydi.
Doğum süreciyle ilgili korkularımın gerçekleşmesi beni çok üzdü.
Doğumda yaşadığım travma hala beni etkiliyor.
"Doğum öncesinde ve sonrasında yaşadığım korkulara rağmen, çocuğuma kavuştuğum için mutluyum."
I think mine stems from anxiety of getting pregnant again. I’m scared I’m gonna trick myself into believing I am and have one of those like ghost pregnancies
My fear of becoming pregnant again is causing me a lot of anxiety.
"I’m terrified that I'll convince myself I'm pregnant when I'm not, like a phantom pregnancy."
"The thought of getting pregnant again is making me anxious, and I'm worried I might start imagining it."
"I'm afraid that my anxiety about pregnancy will make me think I'm pregnant, even if I'm not."
"I'm so worried about getting pregnant again that I'm afraid I'll start to believe I am, even if I'm not."
i got diagnosed in January
any inconvenience and I’m like ugh I can’t do this life
"I'm so frustrated, dealing with all this is just too much."
"This is just so annoying, I can't even deal with this anymore."
"I'm so overwhelmed, I just want to give up."
"I'm at my limit, I can't handle this anymore."
"This is just too much, I'm completely exhausted."
having only one normal week per month
Her ay sadece bir normal hafta olması
Ayda sadece bir hafta normal yaşamın olması
Normal bir yaşamın sadece bir haftası olması
Normal haftanın ayda sadece bir olması
Bir ayda sadece bir normal haftanın olması
becomes delusional
Gerçeklikten kopuyor.
Hayal görmeye başlıyor.
Kendi dünyasına kapanıyor.
Duygusal olarak dengesizleşiyor.
Mantıklı düşünme yeteneğini kaybediyor.
i feel the same way
I understand how you feel.
I'm in the same boat.
I'm experiencing the same thing.
We're on the same page.
I agree with you.
"Like 80% of these run through my mind, too, but only during that very specific time frame."
"Most of these thoughts run through my mind, but only during specific moments."
"I have a lot of thoughts that come and go, but some only appear in particular situations."
"Similar to most of these ideas, they only pop up in my mind at a certain time."
"This thought, like many others, only crosses my mind during a specific period."
"I experience a lot of these fleeting thoughts, but this one is exclusive to a particular time."
"I had a bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, Endo excision, and appendectomy in Dec. I’m still have phantom cycles."
"I had a lot of surgeries in December, but my body still thinks it's supposed to have periods."
"It's been a few months since my surgery, and I'm still experiencing phantom period symptoms."
I'm still feeling the effects of my surgeries even though they're done.
My body is still adjusting to the changes from my surgeries.
I'm hoping the phantom periods will eventually go away.
I would just read the lists when upset and it would just upset me more.
Reading the lists when I was upset only made me feel worse.
"Every time I tried to read the lists when I was upset, it would make me even more upset."
"I thought reading the lists would help me feel better, but it actually made me feel worse."
"I would try to distract myself by reading the lists, but it would just make me more upset."
"I was hoping reading the lists would calm me down, but it just made me feel more agitated."
I tell her to stab me in the heart. It's the only way these thoughts will stop. I've to tell almost everyone I know about my PMDD because I'm a different person during that time of the month.
"I'm trapped in my own head, and the only way out is to scream for help."
"It's like I'm watching myself from the outside, a complete stranger, and I can't control what happens next."
"I feel like I'm going crazy, and the only thing that makes sense is to tell everyone what's going on."
"I'm tired of pretending everything is fine when it's not, so I'm choosing honesty instead."
"I'm not ashamed of my PMDD, but I'm scared of how people will react when they see the real me."
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he don’t understand me!!
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he’s so insensitive!!
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he doesn’t get me!!
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he’s so dismissive!!
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he’s so disrespectful!!
Bf said a very minor “don’t be stupid” comment this morning and I’m ready to never see him again cause he doesn’t know how to communicate!!
"""no one has ever loved me and no one ever will"" ""I’m too fat to love I shouldn’t eat"" ""I wanna eat everything in the world"" ""why can’t I be healthy, I’m so useless"""
I'm not good enough for anyone.
I'll never be happy.
I hate myself.
I'm a burden to everyone.
I wish I could just disappear.
"I do definitely spend a bit too much time on there, especially when I’m having a low energy, laying around day."
I tend to get lost in that world when I'm feeling lazy and want to relax.
"When I'm feeling drained, I find myself spending a lot of time on there."
It's easy to get sucked in when I'm just lounging around and not doing much else.
"On days when I'm lacking motivation, I often find myself spending excessive amounts of time on there."
"I know I probably spend too much time on there, especially when I'm just chillin' and have nothing better to do."
I swear I have skin cancer
"I'm so worried, I think I might have skin cancer."
I went to the doctor and they said I might have skin cancer.
"I've been feeling really bad lately, I think it's skin cancer."
"I've been noticing some strange spots on my skin, I'm scared I have skin cancer."
"I'm really stressed about this, I think I have skin cancer."
"I suddenly thought, 'Oh shit, I had cancer. I could have more cancer. What if it comes back? *checks visible body parts* what if I have some other type of cancer?'"
"I realized, with a jolt, that I might have a relapse, and the thought made me frantic."
"The possibility of cancer returning sent shivers down my spine, I couldn't help but scan my body for any signs."
"A wave of panic washed over me, the thought of cancer coming back, of it being somewhere else in my body."
"My mind raced with worst-case scenarios, 'What if it's back?', 'What if it's spread?', 'What if it's worse this time?'"
"Suddenly, the fear was all-consuming, the possibility of cancer lurking unseen, a terrifying reality."
unstable but at different times of the month…or would we sync up our cycles and both be in hell
"They're unpredictable, but maybe we'll get lucky and our moods will align..."
"It's a rollercoaster, but hopefully we'll be in sync at least some of the time..."
I'm worried we'll both be at our worst at the same time...
"There's no telling when we'll be on the same page, but I hope it's not a bad time..."
"I'm afraid we might be in sync, but not in a good way..."
these sound exactly like my obsessive OCD thoughts… OCD in my experience definitely gets aggravated the closer I get to my period.
This is exactly what my anxiety feels like when I'm about to get my period.
"My intrusive thoughts get so bad right before my period starts, it's like my brain is on overdrive."
"I feel like I'm going crazy with all these random thoughts, it's like my body is preparing for a meltdown."
"I've noticed a definite pattern with my OCD, it gets much worse during the week leading up to my period."
"I'm pretty sure my hormones are playing havoc with my mental health, the way I'm feeling right now is just insane."
my literally brain
My brain is literally fried.
My brain is not working at all.
"I can't even think straight, my brain is gone."
"I'm so exhausted, my brain feels like mush."
My brain is completely blank.
I can’t form sentences or focus my eyes...I’m legit worried I couldn’t operate a car successfully.
"I'm so disoriented, I'm not even sure if I could tie my shoes properly."
"I can't even make a simple decision, let alone navigate a complex situation like driving."
I feel like my brain is completely fogged up. I'm not sure I could remember the way home.
I'm so out of it that I don't even know what day it is. I'm definitely not in any condition to drive.
"I feel like I'm in a dream state. I can barely even hold a conversation, much less drive a vehicle."
"Years ago when I first realized I had pmdd it was around the time I heard the term Highly Sensitive Person, which I strongly related to. I made the association that those things might exist together. I even explained my pmdd as being extremely sensitive to any hormonal fluctuations in my body, the same way I cannot tolerate caffeine."
"I felt like my extreme sensitivity to hormones was similar to my sensitivity to caffeine, like both were exaggerated reactions to certain stimuli."
"It struck me that my pmdd symptoms, like feeling overly sensitive to hormonal shifts, were similar to the concept of being a Highly Sensitive Person."
"The idea that my pmdd could be connected to my heightened sensitivity to everything, even caffeine, seemed to make sense to me."
I remember feeling like I had found a piece of the puzzle when I realized the link between my pmdd and my strong sensitivity to things like caffeine.
"The way I experience pmdd, with its extreme sensitivity to hormonal changes, reminded me of the way I react strongly to caffeine, both feeling like heightened sensitivity."
tried to use birth control to treat PMDD symptoms but couldn’t manage taking it *at the exact same time every day*.
"I tried sticking to a strict schedule for my birth control, but it was hard to take it at the same time every day."
"I couldn’t manage the exact timing of taking my birth control, even though I was trying to."
"I struggled to be consistent with taking my birth control at the same time every day, which is crucial for managing PMDD symptoms."
"I was really committed to using birth control for my PMDD, but I just couldn’t get into a routine of taking it at the exact same time."
"It was a real challenge to take my birth control at the same time every day, even though I knew it was important for managing my PMDD."
I've NEVER suspected that I have ADHD but oh my god! the symptoms you've listed are so relatable and I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I could have ADHD...
"I never thought I had ADHD, but everything you've said about it rings so true!"
"I'm stunned! The things you've described about ADHD are exactly how I feel, and I never even considered it before."
"Wow, I've always been so scattered and forgetful, but I never put it together with ADHD. It all makes sense now!"
"This is wild! I never thought I could have ADHD, but the symptoms you've mentioned are spot on, and I'm starting to realize I might."
"The symptoms you listed for ADHD are shockingly relatable, and I'm starting to think I might have it. I never thought it was possible."
I have terrible time management skills I am late almost all the time... Also I am a huge impulse buyer and the sad thing is I can’t wait for the item to arrive and then sometimes by the time it does I’ve already lost interest in it and don’t even open it right away
"My organizational skills are pretty abysmal, and it seems like I'm always rushing to catch up."
"I've got a serious case of 'buy now, regret later' and half the stuff I order ends up sitting in a box for weeks."
"I'm not sure what it is, but I have this crazy urge to just buy things on a whim, even if I don't really need them."
"I’m terrible with money, I just can’t help myself, I buy things I don’t need and then I never even use them."
"I wish I could be more patient, but I always have to have everything right away. And then, by the time it arrives, I've already moved on."
I had NO idea there was any comorbidity and I felt so much despair at the idea of having all of these compounded conditions.
I was completely unaware of the underlying health issues and the thought of facing multiple complications filled me with despair.
"It never occurred to me that there were any existing conditions, and the prospect of dealing with all these combined problems left me feeling utterly hopeless."
"I had no clue about the pre-existing health problems, and the realization that I had to handle all these issues together made me feel incredibly discouraged."
"I was totally oblivious to the fact that there were any pre-existing health conditions, and the thought of having to manage all of these issues at once made me feel overwhelmed with despair."
"I had absolutely no idea about the comorbidity, and the prospect of facing all these combined health challenges left me feeling completely defeated."
"I have known intuitively and from years of research that I have ADHD and likely ASD.  I am aware of having been masking from age six or thereabouts.  My struggles have been intense, always.  One of the biggest clues was how strongly my usual symptoms are exacerbated by PMDD."
"I've been aware of my ADHD and likely ASD for a long time, both through personal experience and research, and I've realized I've been masking since I was very young."
"The intensity of my struggles, especially the way PMDD intensifies my usual symptoms, is a huge indicator that I have ADHD and likely ASD."
"My masking, which I've been doing since I was about six years old, has made it harder to understand my struggles with ADHD and ASD."
"The way PMDD amplifies my ADHD symptoms is a clear sign that these struggles have been present for a long time, and I've likely been masking them since childhood."
"I've always known that I have ADHD and likely ASD, but it's only recently that I've started to understand the full impact of these conditions, especially how PMDD exacerbates my symptoms."
I was being terrorized by my father during puberty. I sometimes wonder if PMDD Is my endocrine systems trauma response.
"My father's behavior during my adolescence left lasting emotional scars, and I can't help but wonder if my PMDD is a manifestation of that trauma."
"Puberty was a difficult time for me because of my father's actions, and now I'm grappling with the possibility that my PMDD is a physical consequence of that emotional abuse."
"The trauma I experienced during puberty, stemming from my father's behavior, could be linked to my PMDD. It's a terrifying thought, but I can't shake it."
"I'm starting to think that the abuse I suffered from my father during my teenage years may have caused lasting hormonal imbalances, which could be contributing to my PMDD."
"The emotional turmoil I endured during puberty, due to my father's abuse, might have permanently affected my endocrine system, and now I'm dealing with the physical and emotional consequences in the form of PMDD."
I’ve suspected I’m on the spectrum for some time but it’s an expensive and lengthy process to get diagnosed here. I guess my question is this- would it change anything?
"I've been thinking about getting diagnosed with autism, but it's such a hassle and it costs a lot of money."
"I've been wondering if I have autism, but getting diagnosed here is a huge ordeal."
"The idea of getting a diagnosis has been on my mind, but it's so expensive and time-consuming."
"I'm not sure if getting diagnosed would be worth it, considering the cost and effort involved."
I've been hesitant to get diagnosed because it seems like such a long and expensive process.
tired of being alive I feel sometimes
I'm just so exhausted by life sometimes.
There are days when I just want to give up on everything.
Life can be so overwhelming and draining.
I just feel so empty and hopeless sometimes.
I wish I could just escape from this feeling of being trapped.
"I've spent the last week incredibly depressed unable to do anything... My period, depression, and my adhd walk hand in hand."
"My period, depression, and ADHD always seem to collide at the worst times."
It's like my body and brain are conspiring against me during my period.
I feel completely overwhelmed and incapable when these three things hit at once.
"This week has been a constant struggle against the combination of my period, depression, and ADHD."
"I'm exhausted from battling my emotions, lack of focus, and physical discomfort."
you've just skipped through this post looking for relevant information without reading the whole thing- and you do that a lot
"You just skim through articles looking for what you want, not really paying attention to the details."
"I've noticed you tend to jump around in texts, only reading the parts that seem important to you."
"You're always scanning for the key points, never taking the time to absorb the whole picture."
You're so focused on finding the answers that you don't even notice the questions.
"You always seem to be rushing through things, searching for the quickest way to get to the information you need."
I have an adhd diagnosis...symptoms were exacerbated by a series of traumatic events resulting in c-ptsd. Around the same time my pmdd symptoms got much worse.
"I was diagnosed with ADHD, and the symptoms were amplified by the trauma I experienced, leading to PTSD. Coincidentally, my PMDD symptoms also intensified during that time."
"The traumatic events I endured aggravated my ADHD symptoms and resulted in PTSD, while my PMDD also worsened concurrently."
"My ADHD diagnosis came with a series of traumatic experiences that worsened my symptoms and led to PTSD. At the same time, my PMDD symptoms became more severe."
"My ADHD diagnosis wasn't the only thing I was dealing with.  A series of traumatic events exacerbated my symptoms, leading to PTSD and making my PMDD significantly worse."
"The traumatic events I experienced not only triggered PTSD, but they also worsened my ADHD and PMDD symptoms, making everything more difficult."
I'm diagnosed with PMDD and ADHD and I'm pretty sure that all my years of anxiety and OCD diagnoses have actually been wrong.
"I've been struggling with PMDD and ADHD for a while now, and I'm starting to think that all my previous diagnoses of anxiety and OCD were actually misinterpretations."
"It feels like I've been misdiagnosed for years, I'm actually dealing with PMDD and ADHD, not anxiety and OCD."
"I'm finally getting the right diagnosis after years of being told I had anxiety and OCD, it turns out I have PMDD and ADHD."
"Looking back, my symptoms were always more consistent with PMDD and ADHD, not anxiety and OCD, but it took a while to figure that out."
"I feel like I've been living with PMDD and ADHD for years, but I was constantly misdiagnosed with anxiety and OCD."
autism symptoms get so much more worse when i’m about to get my period
My autism symptoms really flare up right before my period.
I feel like my autism is so much more pronounced when I'm about to get my period.
"I'm so much more sensitive and overwhelmed by everything right before my period, it's like my autism is amplified."
My period is always a tough time for me because my autism symptoms get so much worse.
"I wish I knew why my autism symptoms get so much worse before my period, it's really hard to deal with."
I'm so lost and confused about what this means for me and what I can possibly do about it. I have been searching for years for answers about why so many things are so difficult for me.
I feel completely overwhelmed and unsure of what this all implies for my future and how I can even begin to address it.
"I've spent years struggling to understand why I find so many things incredibly challenging, and this just adds to that confusion."
"It's frustrating to feel so lost and uncertain, like I'm wandering through a maze with no map."
The lack of clarity about this situation makes me feel incredibly helpless and unsure of how to move forward.
I'm at a complete loss for words. It's like I'm drowning in a sea of questions with no answers.
"I got the stressed housewife treatment and 10mg of lexapro for anxiety before we 'revisit' the concept of me having ADHD. That was very bad not good. I find relief in yin yoga, hip/shoulder/neck/spine stretching, tibetan bowls/lofi/healing music/piano, apparently require more animal protein than your standard human, warm baths, making nice smells on me and my home, magnesium citrate, moon milk, and tea. Sorry if this is like random I get frustrated we don't get treatment though."
"I feel like I'm constantly being told to just 'deal with it' when it comes to my mental health, but I know I need more support than that."
"It's exhausting trying to explain how I feel when I'm struggling with anxiety and ADHD, and then being told to just take medication."
"I'm trying to find ways to manage my anxiety and ADHD without relying solely on medication, but it's a constant struggle."
"I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of burnout, and I just need some time to recharge and take care of myself."
"I'm grateful for the things that help me manage my anxiety and ADHD, but I wish I didn't have to rely on them in the first place."
I had suspicions but now it's hard to refute about ADHD
"I had my doubts about ADHD, but now I'm seeing the signs everywhere."
"I used to think ADHD was a made-up thing, but now I'm not so sure."
"I wasn't convinced about ADHD before, but after seeing how it impacts my friend, I'm starting to believe it."
"I wasn't sure about ADHD, but the more I learn about it, the more it seems to make sense."
I'm starting to think ADHD might be real because I see it in my own life and the people around me.
"I've got ADHD and PMDD, and it's shark week at the moment. My meds are not working at all and I've felt like complete garbage for the past few days"
I'm having a really rough time right now with all my conditions flaring up.
It feels like my body is attacking itself and I'm just along for the ride.
"I'm so exhausted and overwhelmed, it's hard to even function."
"I can barely get out of bed, let alone do anything productive."
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of hormones and brain fog.
i’ve been diagnosed repeatedly with adhd since i was about 12 years old... and i relate to all criteria i have seen online and all of that behavior beforehand i either attributed it to my adhd or assumed it was just part of my personality and something else entirely.
"My ADHD diagnosis came when I was 12, but I always felt like something was different about me, even before that."
"Looking back, I see so many signs of ADHD in my childhood, but I just thought it was who I was."
"I've always known I was different, but it wasn't until my ADHD diagnosis that I understood why."
"It's hard to say when I first realized I might have ADHD, but I always felt like I didn't quite fit in."
"I used to think my quirky behavior was just part of my personality, but now I know it's my ADHD."
i may have ADHD along side my autism... i lose the ability to function on pmdd weeks
"I think I might be on the spectrum, but it's hard to tell because I also have ADHD."
"My PMDD symptoms are so severe, they make it feel like I have a whole new set of disabilities on top of my autism."
"I know I have autism, but lately I've been wondering if I might also have ADHD, because I've been having trouble focusing."
The combination of my autism and PMDD is making it incredibly difficult to function.
"When my PMDD hits, it's like I lose all my coping mechanisms, and it's even harder to manage my autism."
I had my ADHD diagnosed first then suspected PMDD when I noticed my meds consistently didn't seem to work around luteal phase
"I first realized something was wrong when my ADHD meds weren't working during the luteal phase, leading me to suspect PMDD."
"My ADHD meds seemed to work differently during certain parts of my cycle, prompting me to explore the possibility of PMDD."
The inconsistency in my ADHD medication's effectiveness during the luteal phase made me wonder if I might have PMDD.
"My ADHD meds, which usually worked well, seemed to lose their efficacy around my period, which led me to suspect PMDD."
It wasn't until I observed the consistent ineffectiveness of my ADHD meds during the luteal phase that I began to suspect I might have PMDD.
"It feels nice, in a way, to have a (probable) answer, after all these years of not knowing why I am so damn weird... I've internalized it... it just makes life so much harder, especially being able to succeed at work or in relationships, basically all of life."
It's a weird comfort to have a possible explanation after years of feeling different.
"Knowing why I'm so strange feels like a weight lifted, even if the answer isn't ideal."
"While it's nice to finally have a reason, it also makes it harder to cope with being different."
"It's like I finally understand myself, but that understanding makes life more challenging."
Having an answer to why I'm so weird doesn't necessarily make it easier to live with.
sensory overload during luteal phase
Luteal fazda duyusal aşırı yükleme yaşıyorum.
"Bu luteal fazda, her şey çok yoğun hissediyor."
Duyusal girdiler luteal fazda beni bunaltıyor.
Luteal fazda duyularım çok hassas.
"Bu dönemde, her türlü duyusal uyaran bana çok fazla geliyor."
"I’ve got adhd but I never had a medication work. I also have asd. Realized I had PMDD at ~19, because my mother had it and recognized the symptoms."
"I've struggled with ADHD for years and haven't found a medication that works for me. I also have ASD. My PMDD diagnosis came at 19, after I noticed similarities to my mother's experiences."
"ADHD has been a challenge, with medication not providing the relief I hoped for. I'm also autistic, and didn't realize I had PMDD until I was 19, recognizing the same symptoms in my mother."
"My ADHD has been difficult to manage, with medications not providing the right fit. I also have autism, and it took until I was 19 to realize I had PMDD, thanks to my mother's experience with it."
"I've been diagnosed with ADHD but have yet to find a medication that works. I also have autism. It wasn't until I was 19 that I was diagnosed with PMDD, recognizing the symptoms in myself from my mother."
"Finding the right medication for my ADHD has been an ongoing struggle. I also live with autism.  I didn't get diagnosed with PMDD until I was 19, having seen the same symptoms in my mother."
"I was actually having dissociative episodes because I was going through a major trauma at the time. I can be a downright cold bitch because it feels like I can choose to turn my emotions off for a lot of things. I'm super light sensitive, especially blue light, especially during my luteal phase. Most of my food dislikes are texture based and when in doubt I eat frozen burritos in the same way every time."
I've been diagnosed with sensory processing disorder and certain textures make me feel sick to my stomach.
"I've always been really sensitive to sound and light, even as a kid."
"I know I can be a bit much sometimes, but I'm just trying to find ways to cope with all the things that overwhelm me."
"I'm working on being more open and expressive with my emotions, but it's a struggle sometimes."
I'm just trying to figure out how to live a normal life even though my brain is wired differently.
can't get myself to go to the doctors to get ADHD treatment

"I've been diagnosed with a bunch of mental health issues - chronic depression, anxiety, PMDD, and either ADHD or ASD, or possibly both."
"having ADHD & PMDD, a lot of the medication given to people for ADHD will make your period symptoms a lot worse ie: hormone wise"
"ADHD ve PMDD'nin birleşik etkisiyle, ADHD için verilen birçok ilaç dönemin semptomlarını, özellikle hormonal olarak, daha da kötüleştirebilir."
"ADHD ve PMDD'den muzdarip kişiler, ADHD ilaçlarının dönemlerinin semptomlarını daha da kötüleştirebileceğini bilmelidir."
"Özellikle hormonal olarak, ADHD ilaçlarının dönemin semptomlarını şiddetlendirdiği birçok durumda görüldü."
"ADHD ve PMDD olan kişilere verilen ilaçların, dönemin semptomları üzerinde dikkatli bir şekilde değerlendirilmesi gerekiyor."
"ADHD ilaçlarının yan etkileri arasında dönemin semptomlarının şiddetlenmesi de yer alabilir, bu nedenle bireyselleştirilmiş bir tedavi planı önemlidir."
"I’m diagnosed ADHD + PMDD but this post just made me realize what I’ve long suspected, I may be ASD as well. The neurotypical brain is fascinating! Is there medication for overstimulation because it ruins my life!"

I conclusively have ADHD... I'm just mimicking people to success. I do make a shit ton of mistakes

I'm just winging it and hoping for the best.
"I'm not sure how I'm doing this, but I'm getting results."
"I'm a total imposter, but it seems to be working."
I'm basically faking it until I make it.
I do have ocd and it used to get particularly bad during the luteal phase.

But HOLY HELL how much it helped with the rumination, shitty thoughts and staying on task and focused... If you really think about it, alot of the shitty stuff about PMDD is the mental piece."
"I'm tired of feeling like a zombie all the time, it's like my brain is on autopilot."
I wish there was a magic pill that could fix all my mental health issues.

I'm starting to think that the physical symptoms are just a side effect of the mental turmoil.
"Maybe if I could just get my head straight, everything else would fall into place."
prevalence of pmdd in people with adhd/asd
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) seems to be more common in individuals with ADHD or ASD.
There's a higher chance of finding PMDD in people who also have ADHD or ASD.
The study suggests that people with ADHD/ASD might be at a greater risk for PMDD.
The prevalence rates of PMDD are significantly elevated in individuals diagnosed with ADHD or ASD.
It appears that the co-occurrence of ADHD/ASD and PMDD is quite common.
"Diagnosed PMDD. Diagnosed OSDD. I stim to the point of self harm, have social difficulties (social anxiety and feelings like I don't know how to relate to people) and sensory processing extremes. My OSDD brings out male alters who front more during my period who seem to experience gender/period dysphoria."
"I'm dealing with a lot right now, and it's all very overwhelming."
"I feel so lost and confused about my identity, especially when my alters are present."
"The way my body and mind react to my period is so intense, it's hard to function."
I don't know how to navigate my social interactions when I'm already dealing with so much internally.
"I'm trying to find ways to manage my symptoms, but it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle."
"PMDD is a PREmenstrual mood disorder. Personally, my period is what saves me. My adhd isn’t exacerbated when I’m on my period, it’s relieved. The beginning of your period marks when the hormone cycle resets itself and you can feel relief even 1-2 days before your period."
"PMDD, or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, is a real struggle for many people, but for me, my period is actually a time of relief."
"I have ADHD, and while most people experience worsening symptoms before their period, I find that it actually helps my focus."
"My period is like a reset button for my body, and I often feel a sense of calm and clarity in the days leading up to it."
"It's interesting how everyone experiences their period differently.  For some it's a time of pain and discomfort, but for me, it's a time of respite."
"The hormonal fluctuations that come with your period can have a profound impact on your mood and mental health, but for me, it's a welcome change."

I know I'll put it off for at least 1-2 weeks
"I'm definitely going to delay it for a while, maybe even a couple of weeks."
I have a feeling I'm going to procrastinate on this for at least a week or two.
"I know I'm not going to start on it right away, it'll probably be at least a week or two before I get to it."
I'm thinking I'll wait a week or two before I even begin.

hyperfixating on food for a while and then switching to something new after a while
"I get really obsessed with one type of food for a while, then I'm suddenly onto the next thing."
"There are times when I'm completely fixated on a certain food, but then I move on to something else after a bit."
"My eating habits are kind of cyclical - I go through phases of being really into something specific, and then I switch to something new."
I'm always trying new foods and I tend to hyperfixate on them for a while before moving on.
"I'm easily bored when it comes to food, so I'll get obsessed with something for a while and then switch to something different."
As an AuDHD(ADHD ASD) person with depression and anxiety...
"As an AuDHD individual, I often struggle with managing my emotions."
Living with depression and anxiety alongside AuDHD presents unique challenges.
"My AuDHD, depression, and anxiety create a complex interplay in my life."
"The combination of AuDHD, depression, and anxiety can make everyday tasks difficult."
It's important to understand the unique needs of AuDHD individuals who also experience depression and anxiety.
"I've been masking since I was a little kid too and part of me wishes I hadn't, but it was what I had to do to be socially safe, unfortunately."

I think my celiac is worse because of this.
This is probably why I'm more affected by celiac than others in my family.
I'm convinced that this is the reason my celiac symptoms are more severe.

I have a feeling this is why my celiac is so much harder to manage.
"autistic people often know that mom was abusive and need help processing the feelings, even if it's as simple as 'locate that feeling in your body and focus on it'"
Autistic individuals may have experienced abuse from their mothers and require support in understanding and managing the emotional consequences.
"It can be incredibly challenging for autistic people to grapple with the impact of a mother's abuse, and simple exercises like body awareness can be helpful."
Even something as straightforward as identifying an emotion within your body can be a powerful tool for autistic people who have endured parental abuse.
"The experience of abuse from a parent can be deeply traumatic for autistic individuals, and seeking assistance in processing these feelings is crucial."
"Recognizing the emotional toll of a mother's abuse and providing practical guidance, such as focusing on bodily sensations, can be essential for autistic individuals."

I was suicidal for a solid month. The questionairre I was given was all ADHD symptoms under the title mood disorder questionairre. Man literally tried to take away my ADHD diagnosis and give me a bipolar one when ADHD meds had been working for me for years
"I felt like my ADHD wasn't being taken seriously, like they were just trying to slap a label on me and call it a day."
The doctor seemed more interested in diagnosing me with bipolar disorder than actually listening to my experience with ADHD.
It's frustrating to feel like your mental health is being dismissed and you're being labeled with something you don't have.
"I've been struggling with ADHD for years, and finally found medication that works, but now they're trying to take that away from me."
It's incredibly disheartening to be misdiagnosed and have your treatment plan undermined when you've finally found something that helps.
Adderall moment: when someone takes adderall for the first time after being diagnosed with ADHD and ends up in tears because of how much better life suddenly is.

"Getting a formal diagnosis, really helped me with my persistent depressive disorder, anxiety, and my self image. If you’re feeling bad enough and you get to the point where you realize that you would do anything to feel better than you do right now, then I would get a diagnostic exam."
"Formal bir tanı almak, kalıcı depresyon bozukluğum, kaygım ve benlik imajımla başa çıkmamda gerçekten yardımcı oldu. Kendinizi kötü hissediyor ve daha iyi hissetmek için her şeyi yapacağınıza inanıyorsanız, tanı koyma testi yaptırmanızı öneririm."
"Bir uzmandan tanı almak, yaşadığım kalıcı depresyon, kaygı ve düşük benlik saygısıyla başa çıkmamda bana büyük bir destek oldu. Eğer kendinizi çok kötü hissediyorsanız ve daha iyi hissetmek için her şeyi yapabileceğinize inanıyorsanız, bir doktora görünmenizde fayda var."
"Formal bir tanı, kalıcı depresyon, kaygı ve benlik imajı sorunlarımla mücadele etmemde önemli bir adım oldu. Eğer şu an olduğunuzdan daha iyi hissetmek için her şeyi yapmaya istekliyseniz, bir uzmandan yardım almanızı tavsiye ederim."
"Bir tanı aldığımda, kalıcı depresyon bozukluğum, kaygım ve kendimi nasıl gördüğüm konusunda daha net bir anlayış kazandım. Kendinizi kötü hissediyor ve daha iyi hissetmek için ne gerekiyorsa yapmaya hazırsanız, profesyonel bir yardım almak en doğru karar olacaktır."
"Formal bir tanı, depresyon, kaygı ve benlik saygısı sorunlarımla başa çıkmak için bana bir yol haritası sundu. Eğer kendinizi çok kötü hissediyorsanız ve bu durumdan kurtulmak için her şeyi yapmaya hazır olduğunuzu düşünüyorsanız, bir uzmana görünmeniz faydalı olacaktır."
"For ADHD at least I think it mostly has to do with dopamine, which is already dysregulated and gets worse with estrogen changes. For ASD I think it's more the overstimulation and depression that makes symptoms worse being exacerbated."
"ADHD'nin temelde dopaminle ilgili olduğunu düşünüyorum, zaten düzensiz olan bu hormon östrojen değişimleriyle daha da kötüleşiyor."
ASD'de ise aşırı uyarılma ve depresyonun semptomları daha da kötüleştirdiğini düşünüyorum.
"ADHD'de dopamin dengesizliği çok önemli, özellikle de östrojen seviyeleri değiştiğinde."
ASD'de ise dış uyaranların ve depresyonun semptomları daha da şiddetlendirdiğini düşünüyorum.
"Östrojen değişimi ADHD'de zaten düzensiz olan dopamini daha da olumsuz etkiliyor, ASD'de ise aşırı uyarılma ve depresyon belirtileri daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Had no idea I had ADHD but have been aware of autistic traits and masking since about 9 or 10. Probably masking from the time I entered school or earlier. As soon as I hit puberty going into middle school, ADHD hit so hard that I went from being a straight A student to failing half my classes."
"I've always been aware of my autistic traits and how I mask them, but I never realized I had ADHD until puberty."
I was a good student until middle school when ADHD really kicked in and I started failing classes.
"I think I've been masking my autistic traits since I started school, maybe even earlier."
Puberty was a really rough time for me because I started struggling with ADHD and couldn't keep up with my schoolwork.
"Looking back, I can see how ADHD affected my school performance, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time."
Yeah having ADHD and ASD is incredibly frustrating. I'm not gonna bother with diagnosis of ASD but I've known since I was a kid.
"Living with ADHD and ASD is a real struggle, it's hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it."
"I've always known I was different, but getting diagnosed with both ADHD and ASD made it even more clear."
"I can't imagine having to deal with the challenges of both ADHD and ASD, it sounds incredibly tough."
I'm not sure how I would handle the frustrations of living with both ADHD and ASD.
It's hard to function in a world designed for neurotypical people when you have both ADHD and ASD.
"I kinda say both but diagnostically I check all of the AvPD boxes. My antidepressants don't really seem to make a dent long term and they never weather big events well. I hate Adderall, makes my anxiety so much worse, like my heart wants to burst out of my chest, and the jitters something awful."
"I think I have both AvPD and anxiety, but the AvPD symptoms are definitely more prominent. "
My meds don't really help with the long-term issues and they're useless when things get really stressful.
"Adderall is a nightmare for me, it makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like my heart is going to explode."
I've tried a bunch of different antidepressants but nothing seems to work for very long.
"I'm starting to feel like I'm just stuck in this cycle of anxiety and medication, it's exhausting."
"I get severely depressed during days 14-28. I feel better, even though it's only been four days of taking it. I just wonder if there's something wrong with my hormone levels that would explain why I feel so bad during the days leading up to my period or if it's just how I am naturally."
"I've always felt incredibly low during the second half of my cycle, it's almost like a switch flips."
"It's so frustrating to feel so down for two weeks out of the month, it makes it hard to plan anything."
"I'm starting to think there's something more to this than just PMS, I just don't feel like myself."
"I'm hoping this new medication will help even things out, I can't keep feeling like this every month."
"It's like my body just gives up on me for those two weeks, it's so draining."
"I can’t sleep, I overeat everything, I hate myself and feel like a loser, take everything personally and am pissed off at the world."
"I'm so stressed and anxious that I can't focus on anything, I keep snapping at people, and I feel completely overwhelmed."
"I'm so exhausted but I can't seem to stop myself from staying up late, scrolling on my phone, and then I wake up feeling even more drained."
"I feel like I'm constantly failing, I'm always comparing myself to others, and I'm just so disappointed in myself."
"I just want to hide away from the world, I'm so embarrassed by my mistakes and I feel like everyone is judging me."
"I'm so angry and frustrated with everything, I feel like nothing is going right and I just don't know what to do anymore."
I feel alone. I’m sad. I’m depressed. I’m scared. I literally feel like I could hurt someone and that it would feel amazing to do so.
I feel so lost and hopeless. I just want someone to understand how I feel.
"I’m so overwhelmed with negative emotions, it’s hard to even think straight."
It’s like I’m drowning in sadness and despair. I don’t know how to get out.
"I feel like I’m constantly on edge, just waiting for something bad to happen."
"I’m so angry and frustrated, I feel like I could just explode."
I feel like my skeleton is too tight in my body and I'd like to peel my skin off like I am a human orange. ... I seriously am just feeling like I'd love to claw myself out of my flesh prison.
"I'm feeling so trapped in my own body, like I need to break free from this fleshy cage."
"It feels like my skin is suffocating me, I just want to shed it all and start over."
"My bones feel like they're being squeezed, I need to get out of this skin suit."
"I feel like I'm a prisoner in my own body, I'm desperate to escape this flesh prison."
"I'm so uncomfortable in my own skin, it feels like I'm wearing someone else's clothes."
"I will be severely numb 1-2 weeks before menstruation, and 1-2 weeks after that I will be a bit better. And when I am numb, I have suicidal ideation, I feel like giving up in my life, I cant do anything."
I experience a period of intense numbness and despair leading up to my menstruation and for a couple of weeks afterwards.
"The two weeks before and after my period are the worst, I feel completely numb and unable to cope."
"My mood plummets drastically in the weeks surrounding my period, leaving me feeling suicidal and hopeless."
The numbness I feel before and after my period is so overwhelming that I struggle to even carry out basic tasks.
"During the two weeks before and after my period, I feel completely disconnected from my life and my own emotions."
"intrusive thoughts start flooding in, convincing me they can't stand being around me. That all of my actions hurt them or made them uncomfortable or made them question being my friend. I feel like I'm actually going insane when it worsens, and just want to hide in a closet and never come out."
"I feel like I'm a burden to everyone I know, like I'm constantly doing something wrong."
"My mind plays these awful scenarios where everyone I care about is disgusted by me, like I'm a walking, talking catastrophe."
The negative thoughts just keep coming and I can't shake the feeling that I'm pushing everyone away.
"It feels like I'm constantly on edge, wondering if I've said or done something to offend someone."
I'm so afraid of messing things up that I just want to withdraw from the world and disappear.
"I've lived my life on a biweekly schedule for most of my life. I experience excessive daytime sleepiness during luteal, that has me falling asleep at very inconvenient times. I was diagnosed with moderate-severe complex sleep apnea."
"I've been feeling so tired lately, even during the day, and it's making it hard to focus on work."
"The sleep doctor said I have sleep apnea, and it's been affecting my quality of life."
"I've been trying to adjust my schedule to get more sleep, but it's been difficult to find the time."
"I'm exhausted all the time, even after a full night's sleep. It's really frustrating."
"I'm concerned about the impact of my sleep apnea on my health, but I'm hoping to find some relief soon."
One of my biggest struggles is sleep the week leading to my period... This just fills me with major anxiety and today is one of those days. I’m just so anxious and upset right now; so fucking tired of this awful disorder.
My period is coming next week and I'm already dreading the insomnia. It's so frustrating to feel this way.
It's like my body is sabotaging me with all these pre-period symptoms. I can't focus and I'm just so tired.
I'm so over the constant anxiety and exhaustion leading up to my period. It feels like it's never ending.
This premenstrual syndrome is really getting to me. I just want to sleep for a week straight.
I can't even explain how much I hate this time of the month. It's like my brain is on fire and my body is falling apart.
feel the inkling of my brain going into asshole mode... Don't become overly self critical to the point of self destruction.
"I'm starting to feel like I'm getting really negative and critical of myself, like I'm going to spiral out of control."
"I'm starting to feel like I'm getting really cynical and pessimistic, and it's making me want to give up."
I feel like I'm getting so wrapped up in my own self-criticism that I'm starting to lose sight of everything else.
"I'm starting to feel like I'm being too hard on myself, and it's making me feel really anxious and stressed."
I'm starting to feel like I'm getting so caught up in my own negative thoughts that I'm not able to see anything positive.
the physical/mental torture of hell week
The physical and mental exhaustion of hell week was unbearable.
Hell week pushed us to our physical and mental limits.
The relentless physical and mental challenges of hell week were torturous.
Hell week was a week of intense physical and mental hardship.
I've never experienced such physical and mental torture as I did during hell week.
I'm not easy to display it outwardly. I'm in my 'spiralling' phase 😅
I'm not the kind of person who wears their emotions on their sleeve.
It's hard for me to express how I'm feeling right now.
"I'm going through a lot internally, it's not something I can easily share."
"I'm in a bit of a whirlwind right now, trying to figure things out."
"My head's all over the place, it's hard to articulate what's going on."
"I wrote about ""PMDD + emotionally unintelligent fiance"" last month. This month, I again started a fight about 7 days before and then again 1 day after my period start date. ... I've been a passive victim of my diagnosis and demanded more and more understanding and support from him. ... I've been very unlovable and unpredictable. ... It's a miracle how he has managed to stay with me for 8 years, with the past year or two being worse than ever before. ... I've stopped applying for jobs and don't even know what I want to do next. I've lost all self-confidence. I've been burned out and depressed and that's made the PMDD way worse..."
"I feel like a burden to him, especially with how much I've been struggling lately."
"It's hard to see how much I've pushed him away, even though I know he loves me."
I feel like I'm constantly on edge and I'm afraid of hurting him.
I'm so exhausted from the constant fighting and I don't know how much longer I can keep going.
"I wish I could just be normal and happy, but I feel so lost and hopeless."
I'm so sick of this rollercoaster. I love my follicular but my luteal phase is gonna end up killing me. I can't keep a routine or stability and I hate my partner half the month. I feel like I'm just treading water trying to get through each month but it just feels too hard.
"My period is such a chaotic ride, it's driving me crazy."
"It feels like I'm on a constant emotional rollercoaster, it's exhausting."
I love my energy levels during ovulation but then the PMS hits and I just want to hibernate.
"I hate how unpredictable my moods are, it's hard to keep my life together."
"My partner knows that I'm a different person during my luteal phase, I just hope he'll be patient."
I am feeling very sad tonight and I can't pinpoint why. ... sadness is a symptom for today
"I'm feeling really down tonight, I just can't shake this feeling of emptiness."
"This sadness feels so heavy, like a dark cloud hanging over me."
"I don't know what's bringing me down, but I feel incredibly sad."
"It's like a weight on my chest, this sadness, and I can't explain it."
"I'm overwhelmed with this sadness, and it's impossible to ignore."
"Severe impatience with a client over the phone, Shouting at my cat for being a greedy little bism"
"Benimle anlaşmaya çalışırken müşteriye telefonla sert davranıyordum, kedim de açgözlü bir şeymiş gibi ona bağırıyordum."
"Müşteriye telefonla bağırdım, kedime de açgözlü olduğunu söyleyerek bağırıyordum."
"Müşterinin beni dinlememesiyle sinirlenip bağırıyordum, ayrıca kedim de bana bakıp durduğundan ona da bağırdım."
"Müşteriyle telefonda konuşurken sabrım taştı ve ona bağırdım, kedim de yemeğini kapmak için yalvarınca ona da bağırmak zorunda kaldım."
"Telefonla müşteriyle tartışırken sinirlerim bozuldu ve ona bağırmaya başladım, kedim de yemek istiyormuş gibi miyavlıyordu, ona da bağırdım."
"multiple rounds of hysterical ugly crying, and fighting the urge to eat everything in sight... mood swings, who tell us we're pretty even though we are bloated, and watch helplessly as we cry or rage through this sh*t storm each month"
"That time of the month where I oscillate between wanting to consume the entire pantry and feeling like a beached whale, all while my friends try to convince me I'm still beautiful."
"I swear, the emotional roller coaster of PMS is a wild ride. One minute I'm sobbing uncontrollably, the next I'm plotting to conquer the world (and maybe eat it too)."
"The monthly struggle is real. I'm talking uncontrollable cravings, a raging inferno of emotions, and enough self-doubt to sink a ship."
I'm convinced the universe has a personal vendetta against me during this time. It's like my body is a chaotic symphony of hormonal chaos.
"Hormones are a fickle mistress. They can make me feel like a queen one moment, and a raging monster the next. Thank goodness for my friends who always manage to pull me back from the brink."
I'm so tired of going from good to bad. I'm just so tired of experiencing the lows. When its good its so good. But my god. The bad is so bad. I don't know if it's worth it.
"The highs are amazing, but the lows are unbearable. It's exhausting."
"I'm constantly on this rollercoaster of emotions, and it's taking its toll."
"I crave consistency, but life seems to be all about extremes."
It's hard to enjoy the good times when you know the bad times are coming.
The lows are so intense that they make the good times seem insignificant.
mood swings and crazy thoughts increase a huge amount while in a romantic relationship
Romantic relationships can really mess with your emotions and lead to some wild thoughts.
Being in love makes you feel like you're on an emotional rollercoaster.
My head is spinning with all these crazy ideas and feelings since I started dating this person.
"I can't tell if I'm happy or sad, it's like my mood is changing every second."
"Love can drive you mad, sometimes you're on top of the world and other times you're in the depths of despair."
"I had horrible mood swings before my period, and thought I was just crazy. Once every month I would go full hysterical and throw tantrums. crying and the next day I would be perfectly be fine. It’s been affecting my mental health, and just entirely difficult…just…difficult in every way of my life."
The PMS symptoms were so severe I felt like I was losing my mind.
"It was like a switch flipped every month, one minute I was a raging mess and the next I was perfectly normal."
It's hard to function when you're constantly battling these intense mood swings.
"I would go from laughing one minute to crying the next, it was completely unpredictable."
"My whole life felt like it was dictated by my period, it was exhausting and frustrating."
"She was battling recurrent bouts of severe depression and anxiety. She didn’t simply give up. She fought for herself for years by going to her doctors’ appointments and by taking the medications prescribed to her. When the depression became unbearable, she checked herself into psychiatric hospitals on multiple occasions out of fear she may hurt herself. Despite years of doctors’ visits and hospital stays, none of the health care professionals noticed what was happening. They misdiagnosed her with treatment-resistant depression, major depressive disorder with anxiety, panic disorder, and even bipolar disorder."
She was struggling with mental health challenges that were difficult to manage and that made her feel desperate and afraid.
Her mental health issues were so severe that she was hospitalized multiple times because she felt like she was a danger to herself.
"She tried everything to get better, but no one seemed to understand what was really wrong with her."
"She had been seeing doctors for years, and she had been taking all the medications they prescribed, but she still wasn’t getting better."
"She was diagnosed with a variety of mental health conditions, but none of the treatments seemed to work."
"I get these cold sores that can pop up anywhere on my face, nose, forehead and chin. They have left me scarring and they are painful, hard, and clear fluid filled….."
"I'm so tired of these cold sores, they can pop up anywhere on my face and they always leave ugly scars."
"I've been struggling with these cold sores for so long, it seems like they're always there."
"These cold sores are such a pain, they're painful, hard, and filled with clear fluid, not to mention they leave scarring."
"I can't believe how much these cold sores affect me, they're not only painful but also leave scars."
"It's so frustrating to have these cold sores, they can pop up anywhere on my face and they always seem to be there."
I have depression/anxiety/adhd...my depression gets so much worse...my mind clears up and I feel better again.
I feel miserable. Just moving hurts and I feel so on edge😓 I feel like I need to be sedated so I’m not so uncomfortable.
"I'm in so much pain, I just want to sleep for a week."
"I'm so tense and restless, I can barely sit still."
Everything just feels overwhelming right now.
I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of snapping.
I just want to be numb to everything for a while.
i have adhd and also take strattera at night and vyvanse in the morning. but i did not sleep a wink of sleep last night.
"I'm on medication for ADHD, but I couldn't sleep a wink last night."
"Strattera and Vyvanse are supposed to help me sleep, but I was wide awake all night."
"Even though I'm taking my ADHD meds, I still have trouble sleeping."
"I'm not sure if my ADHD meds are affecting my sleep, but I haven't slept well lately."
"I'm taking all my medication as prescribed, but I still can't seem to get a good night's sleep."
"i've been making triggering jokes about suicide like maybe i mean it, maybe i dont, I started thinking everyone hates me, SUPER sensitive to rejection so i start distancing from people who mean the most to me, which makes it worse because i'm also super clingy during this time and oddly jealous and upset when my favorite person is busy, i feeling super ugly & bloated, etc etc."
I'm feeling so awful lately and I'm pushing away the people I care about most.
I've been making dark jokes and I'm scared that people think I'm serious.
I feel like I'm drowning in self-doubt and negativity.
"I'm trying to hide my feelings, but I'm also reaching out for help at the same time."
"I just want to feel loved and accepted, but I'm afraid of being hurt."
i have gad and pmdd... wanna like break up with their boyfriend for no reason? like i don’t want to but like why am i having thoughts that im unhappy with the relationship?
"I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't want to break up with him but these thoughts keep popping up in my head."
I know I should be happy but I can't shake this feeling that something's wrong with the relationship.
"It's like my body is betraying me, I feel awful and I don't even know why."
"I feel like I'm constantly on edge, I just want to feel normal again."
Is it normal to have these thoughts when you're happy? I feel so confused.
"feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and/or depressed, withdrawing or isolating socially, and generally feeling like someone was hijacking my brain for a few days every month."
"I felt like I was losing control of my mind for a few days every month, and it was incredibly isolating and depressing."
"Every month, I'd experience this overwhelming anxiety and depression, and it felt like I was losing my grip on reality."
"The anxiety, depression, and withdrawal were so intense that it felt like someone was taking over my brain for a few days."
"It was like a switch flipped, and I'd suddenly feel consumed by anxiety, depression, and a desperate need to isolate myself."
"I'd find myself withdrawing from everyone, feeling overwhelmed and anxious, like I was trapped in a fog of depression that lasted for a few days."
I have PMDD and I am so so so ready to just quit. I have a meeting tomorrow to discuss this with my chair but I’ve already written a resignation letter. My health and sanity are too important.
"I'm at my breaking point. This condition is taking a toll on my well-being, and I can't keep going like this."
This isn't sustainable. I'm constantly battling this and it's affecting everything in my life.
"I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work. It's time to prioritize my health and mental well-being."
"My job is important, but my health and happiness are more important. I have to put myself first this time."
"I'm not giving up, I'm just taking a step back to focus on myself. This isn't a reflection on my commitment, it's about prioritizing my well-being."
I feel so upset right now. And disappointed. I hate having this. I hate feeling like shit. I hate hating everything and hating myself every month. I feel so anxious right now.
I'm so frustrated and overwhelmed. This whole thing just makes me feel like I'm failing.
It's so hard to deal with this every month. I just want to feel normal.
This feeling of helplessness is making me feel so discouraged.
"I wish I could just shake this off, but I feel trapped."
I'm exhausted from constantly battling these negative emotions.
"I always get insanely depressed in the week AFTER my period. Like, everything is dark and black and I need to kill myself before I die alone, levels of depressed."
"I feel like the world is crashing down on me the week after my period, and I can't even get out of bed."
"The week following my period, I'm constantly battling intense feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and nothing seems to matter."
"That week after my period is always the worst. I feel so empty and isolated, and I just want to disappear."
It's like I'm trapped in a dark cloud of despair during the week after my period. All I can think about is how much I hate my life.
"The week after my period is a rollercoaster of emotions, and I can't seem to escape the feeling that everything is pointless."
this month has been a rough one pmdd wise (and overall stress wise). They help me smile when I feel empty inside.
"This month has been a real struggle, especially with PMDD and all the stress."
"It's been a rough month, emotionally and mentally, but these little things help me cope."
"I'm feeling really down this month, PMDD is making it tough, but  finding joy in simple things is important."
"I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard with how much stress I'm dealing with, and PMDD is making things worse."
"I'm so grateful for the things that bring me joy, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed by PMDD and stress."
struggling and having a very hard time coping
I'm really struggling and finding it very difficult to manage.
"Things are tough right now, and I'm having a hard time coping."
I'm going through a lot and finding it really challenging to deal with.
I'm feeling overwhelmed and struggling to keep up.
"It's been a real struggle, and I'm having a hard time keeping my head above water."
I barely slept. I’ve been super uneasy since. ...my anxiety has also been up a lot and it’s turning into a feedback loop.
"I haven't been able to get any rest, my mind's been racing ever since."
"I'm feeling so on edge, I haven't slept a wink. I think it's just been building up."
"I'm exhausted, but I can't seem to shut off my brain. It's like a constant cycle of worry."
"I feel like I'm caught in a loop of stress and anxiety, it's hard to break free."
"My mind is just going a million miles a minute, I can't seem to calm down."
fight. Bad. And when I try to calm him down it gets worse and he keeps attacking me long after I stopped
I'm exhausted from constantly defending myself.
He's been in a rage for hours and won't stop.
It's like he's possessed by anger.
I'm afraid of what he might do next.
This is becoming a dangerous situation.
I was diagnosed with PMDD a few years ago...I was diagnosed with ADHD and I started uncovering that the two might be connected? I just started Concerta for my ADHD but I was wondering if anyone had any experience with ADHD medication alleviating PMDD symptoms?
"I've been taking medication for my ADHD for a while now, and I've noticed a slight improvement in my PMDD symptoms, but I'm still struggling."
"It's really frustrating because I know there's a connection between PMDD and ADHD, but it's hard to find information about how medication for one can impact the other."
I'm curious if anyone else has tried different ADHD medications and seen how they affect their PMDD.
"I'm hoping that with the right medication, I can finally find some relief from both my ADHD and PMDD."
"It's amazing how much research is being done on these conditions, but I wish there was more information on how to treat them together."
I feel like I am tethered to a hot air balloon above my body and that life is hopeless (even though I KNOW COGNITIVELY that it is not).
"I feel so disconnected from myself, like I'm watching my own life unfold from a distance."
"It's like I'm trapped in a dream, unable to influence my own reality."
"I'm just drifting along, with no sense of purpose or direction."
"Everything feels futile, like I'm pushing against an invisible wall."
"I feel so alone, even though I know people care about me."
Yesterday I was at rock bottom praying for some type of relief from all the physical pain and depressive symptoms. ...I feel like i’m two different people sometimes.
"I felt so lost and hopeless yesterday, it was like I was at the lowest point of my life."
"Yesterday was a really rough day for me, I was in so much pain and feeling so depressed."
"I was completely overwhelmed with physical pain and sadness yesterday, I just wanted it all to stop."
"I feel like I'm going through a constant battle within myself, one part of me is trying to stay strong while the other is just falling apart."
"It's hard to explain, but it's like I'm living two completely separate lives - one full of joy and the other filled with pain and despair."
"I feel like total ass the week before... i have felt bad mentally since monday, physically since Thursday."
"I've been feeling terrible all week, mentally since Monday and physically since Thursday."
"The week before has been a complete disaster, I've been feeling mentally off since Monday and physically awful since Thursday."
"I feel completely drained, I've been feeling mentally down since Monday and physically sick since Thursday."
"I'm feeling like a complete wreck, I've been feeling mentally exhausted since Monday and physically unwell since Thursday."
"I'm feeling absolutely terrible, mentally drained since Monday and physically unwell since Thursday."
I couldn't sleep because I kept on crying. So decided to make mashed potatoes. Then cried about how good they were. Now I'm laughing because if anyone had seen this - this must've looked crazy.
"I felt so overwhelmed by the movie that I couldn't sleep, so I started cleaning. Then I started crying because my house is a mess, but now I'm laughing because I realize it's just a house and it's not that big of a deal."
"I couldn't stop thinking about how much I miss my dog, so I made her favorite biscuits. Then I started crying because I knew she wouldn't be there to eat them, but now I'm laughing because I realize that she's better off without me."
"I couldn't focus on work because I was so anxious, so I decided to take a walk. Then I started crying because I realized how much I miss being in nature, but now I'm laughing because I know I'm not alone in feeling this way."
"I couldn't stop thinking about my ex, so I decided to write them a letter. Then I started crying because I realized how much I still loved them, but now I'm laughing because I know I deserve better."
"I couldn't stop crying because I was so overwhelmed by the news, so I decided to make some tea. Then I started laughing because I realized that I was making myself tea when the world was burning down, but now I'm laughing because I realize that's the only thing I could do."
"on edge, on the verge of tears at any moment, shivering, shaking, cold and hot flashes, acid reflux and nausea, constipation, bloating, gas, and last but not least insane dizziness... i just feel so icky. i want to shower, i feel so grossed out from myself that im going to cry. if it wasnt for typing this out right now i would be obsessively scratching at my body in disgust bc i just feel so gross."
"I'm feeling absolutely miserable, every part of me aches and I feel like I'm coming down with something."
"My body is rebelling against me, I feel like I'm going to explode from the inside out."
"I can't stop shaking, my stomach is churning and I just feel so utterly disgusting."
"I'm so exhausted and overwhelmed, every part of me feels heavy and I can't seem to get comfortable."
"I've never felt this awful before, it's like my body is betraying me and I just want to disappear."
"I get very lightheaded, and EXTREME anxiety. Lasts like 10-20 minutes. Then I start my period."
I feel dizzy and anxious right before my period starts.
My period is always preceded by intense lightheadedness and anxiety.
I get super anxious and lightheaded for about 20 minutes before my period starts.
The anxiety and dizziness hit me hard for about 10-20 minutes before my period.
I know my period is coming because I get super lightheaded and anxious for about 10-20 minutes.
"Early peri + PMDD was very very rough, but late peri has been amazing for the PMDD."
I'm so glad that early perimenopause was so difficult because late perimenopause has been amazing for my PMDD.
I can't believe how much better my PMDD has been since I entered late perimenopause.
The difference between early and late perimenopause for my PMDD has been night and day.
"Early peri was brutal, but late peri has been a complete game-changer for my PMDD."
It's like my body finally figured out how to manage my PMDD in late perimenopause.
"Every time I’m in my luteal phase, I have a complete identity crisis... I don’t like that I go through such an intense shift every month. It just feels horrible going through a week or two of this because it leaves me wondering if I even have an actual identity. I hate being at the mercy of this fucking disorder."
It's frustrating that my mood swings are so dramatic during this phase of my cycle.  I feel like I lose myself completely.
The changes I experience every month are so intense that they make me question who I even am. It's like a mini-identity crisis.
I don't understand why this hormonal rollercoaster has to be such a huge part of my life. It's just so emotionally draining.
I feel like I'm a completely different person during my luteal phase. It's like my true self is hidden beneath a mask of hormones.
I wish I could just skip this whole phase altogether. It's a constant struggle to deal with the emotional turmoil.
"I just feel bad because he took me to dinner the other day, spent $100 on us and I can’t do that back. I’m worried that he won’t think it’s enough or that maybe it isn’t. I’m worried he won’t enjoy it as much as he would going out for dinner."
"I feel obligated to reciprocate his generosity, but I'm afraid I can't match his spending power."
I'm worried that my gesture won't be seen as a fair exchange for what he did for me.
"I want to show him how much I appreciate his kindness, but I'm not sure what to do that would feel equal."
I'm struggling to find a way to thank him without making it seem like I'm trying to keep up with his spending.
I'm afraid that anything I do won't live up to the experience he provided for me.
"Nobody teaches you how to sit with misery. I have noticed that misery is a given. You either are miserable, or you are momentarily distracted from misery through healthy or unhealthy distractions. Today, I am extremely tired of feeling this way. I feel tired. And so be it. Today, I will sit with my misery. I will sit with her. She just wants to be listened to."
"Nobody teaches you how to cope with sadness, you just learn as you go."
"You can't escape sadness, it's always there lurking beneath the surface."
"It's okay to feel sad, it's a part of life.  The important thing is to acknowledge it and move forward."
Sometimes the best thing you can do is just sit with your sadness and let it be.
"I'm tired of fighting my sadness, I'm going to let it be and see what happens."
"my lower back starts cramping about 5 days before ovulation, I also feel like I have to pee much more. Then of course following week I have pms"
My body seems to give me a heads up that ovulation is coming by making my lower back ache and needing to pee more.
The week before my period always starts with my lower back feeling tight and needing to use the restroom more often.
I swear my body is sending me a secret signal that I'm about to ovulate with the lower back cramps and frequent bathroom trips.
"It's like my body has a built-in alarm clock for ovulation, but instead of a ringing sound, it uses lower back cramps and increased urination."
I know ovulation is coming when my lower back starts to cramp and I feel like I need to pee every five minutes.
I feel like my heart is being ripped to shreds. My heart is actually in such physical pain. I feel like I’m gonna die of sorrow right now. PMDD symptoms are just turned up to max. I can barely get out of bed. I don’t know how to cope. Everything seems empty and meaningless.
My emotions are so overwhelming that I feel like I'm going to explode.
"I can't catch my breath, it feels like someone is squeezing my chest."
This emotional turmoil is making it impossible to function.
"I just want the pain to stop, I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow."
"I feel so lost and alone, like I'm falling apart at the seams."
Thoughts of being single just to have eyes only for your partner once you’re out of luteal stage? And then thinking that maybe you’re not equipped for a relationship or even to lead an ordinary life for that matter
"Is it just me, or do you ever think about how amazing it would be to be completely focused on your partner once you're not in your luteal phase? Like, just the two of you, no distractions.  And then you worry that you're not even capable of a relationship, or maybe even a normal life, for that matter?"
"Sometimes I get this crazy idea, like, maybe I should be single just so I can be totally devoted to my partner after my luteal phase.  But then I wonder if I'm even cut out for a relationship, or even a regular life, really."
"I think about how it'd be so nice to just have eyes for my partner after the luteal phase is over, but then I get this nagging feeling that maybe I'm not good at relationships, or maybe I'm not even equipped to live a normal life."
"You know, I sometimes fantasize about being single just so I can be completely present with my partner when the luteal phase is done.  But then I get this overwhelming sense that I'm not cut out for relationships, or maybe even for a regular life, to be honest."
"It's so tempting to imagine being single just to be completely focused on my partner when the luteal phase is over, but then I think about how maybe I'm just not made for relationships, or maybe I'm not even equipped for a normal life, for that matter."
"I’ll have a thought, realize it could be hurtful, and will just feel so satisfied saying it."
"I know it might be a little harsh, but I still feel good saying it."
"I have this feeling, even though it’s not exactly nice, but it makes me feel great to just blurt it out."
"I’ll just let it slip out, even if it stings a bit, and I’ll just feel so good after."
"I’ve been thinking about this, and I know it might be a bit rough, but it’s just so satisfying to get it off my chest."
"I’ve got this idea, and I’ll say it even if it’s a little mean, because it’s just so good to get it out there."
"My body aches and hurts, my chest feels like it will burst open. It's as though a predator is about to attack me. Even my arms burn down to the elbows. My brain actually hurts. I feel fire and pain in the back upper portion of my head. And my mind screaming the whole time 'Kill yourself. You are worthless.'"
"My entire being is engulfed in pain. It feels like my bones are breaking, and my head is about to explode."
"Every muscle in my body feels like it's on fire. My chest is tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath."
The pain is so intense that it feels like I'm being attacked from the inside out. It's a constant assault on my body and my mind.
"I feel completely broken and shattered. My body is in agony, and my mind is filled with despair."
The pain is relentless and all-consuming. It's like a monster that's slowly eating away at me from the inside out.

"I haven't experienced a full-blown psychotic episode, but I've felt the precursory symptoms, like a creeping sense of unease."
"It's like my mind is on overdrive, with heightened awareness and a flood of intense emotions, but without the disorientation of a true break."

"I'm at my wit's end, I need someone to notice me before I do something I regret."
I know that my PMDD really challenges my energy levels despite all my medication and supplements. I ran into this last night and couldn't get myself to do anything...
"My PMDD makes it so hard to function sometimes, even with all the meds and stuff I take."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting my PMDD, no matter what I do."
"I'm so frustrated that my PMDD is draining me, even with all the help I'm getting."
"It's like my PMDD is always there, pulling me down, even when I'm trying my best."
"It's exhausting trying to manage my PMDD, even with all the support I have."
"Literally felt mittelschmerz this morning- snap, crackle, pop of ovaries. Day 14, like clockwork. And the pain traveled to my butt lol. It’s likely an ovarian cyst they ruptured in lieu of release an egg."
"I woke up this morning feeling the sharp, popping pain of mittelschmerz - it was like my ovaries were doing a little dance! Must be day 14, just as expected."
"Ugh, that mittelschmerz hit me this morning - felt like a mini earthquake in my abdomen. It's crazy how my body knows exactly when to remind me I'm ovulating."
"It's day 14, and the mittelschmerz is here in full force. My ovaries are practically screaming at me right now, and the pain is even radiating down to my butt."
"The pain from my ovaries started this morning - classic mittelschmerz. I guess it's day 14 again.  This time, it feels like the pain is actually travelling down to my butt!"
I'm pretty sure I just had an ovarian cyst rupture - that's what I get for being so perfectly on schedule with ovulation.
"I swear the IUD gave me PMDD, and Yaz made my anxiety excruciating. I just don’t want to turn into a psychotic monster every month and prefer not to turn into a depressed sack of potatoes either."
I'm so tired of feeling like a completely different person every month.
I can't believe how much my mood swings affect my daily life.
"It's like my body is betraying me, and I have no control over it."
"I just want to feel like myself, without the constant emotional rollercoaster."
I'm so grateful for the days I don't have to worry about feeling completely out of control.
"He'd just experience some textbook PMDD symptoms, nothing too intense, but it would be disruptive to work and home life. Then he'd bleed from his penis for 5 days."
"He'd be having the typical PMDD symptoms again, nothing too debilitating, but enough to make work and home life difficult. Then he'd have his period for 5 days."
"The PMDD symptoms were hitting him hard this month, nothing unbearable, but enough to make his day-to-day life challenging. Then he'd have his period for 5 days."
"He'd feel the usual PMDD symptoms, nothing debilitating, but enough to make it hard to focus on work and family. Then he'd be on his period for 5 days."
"He'd experience the classic PMDD symptoms again, nothing too bad, but enough to make it tough to function at work and at home. Then he'd have his period for 5 days."
"He'd have the usual PMDD symptoms, nothing serious, but enough to make it difficult to get things done. Then he'd bleed for 5 days."
The brain fog and fatique. I just want to hide and not see anyone or answer anyone today. I can't think.
"I'm so exhausted and my mind feels like it's full of cotton, I just want to disappear for the day."
"I'm completely drained and can't focus at all, I need to isolate myself and just recharge."
"My brain is fried and I have zero energy, I just want to curl up and not interact with anyone."
"I feel totally overwhelmed and my head is fuzzy, I just need to shut down for a while."
"I'm struggling to think clearly and I'm completely wiped out, I'd rather be alone and not have to talk to anyone."
"I had a baby last August. Pregnancy was the best I have felt and I had a great postpartum experience up until about month 8 or so. I feel my symptoms returning and I really want to get ahead of it so I can be the best mom and partner possible. I’ve been getting acupuncture twice a week for a month and my mental state is worse than ever since starting. It’s made me reflect back and I realize every time I have tried something to help, it’s made my depression, anger, and overwhelm way worse and last outside of luteal."
"I've been trying different things to manage my postpartum symptoms, but nothing seems to work and it's making me feel worse."
I'm struggling with my mental health right now and it's impacting my ability to be the mom and partner I want to be.
"I'm so frustrated because I'm trying to do everything right, but it's not enough to make me feel better."
I feel like I'm constantly fighting against my own body and I don't know what to do anymore.
I'm starting to feel hopeless and I'm afraid I'm not going to get better.
"I feel so bloated and not pretty right now. Feeling mostly okay emotions wise, just gonna take care of myself and do some self care."
"I'm not feeling my best today, but I'm going to focus on taking care of myself."
"I'm feeling a bit puffy and not my usual self, but I'm going to do some things to make myself feel better."
"I'm feeling a little off, but I know that taking care of myself will help me feel better."
"I'm not feeling great physically, but I'm feeling good emotionally, so I'm going to take some time for myself."
"I'm feeling a little bit down, but I know that I'll feel better if I take care of myself."
repeatedly so much trauma to the brain and body
The constant exposure to trauma takes a serious toll on both the mind and the physical body.
"The brain and body have been subjected to repeated traumatic experiences, leaving lasting damage."
This relentless onslaught of trauma has caused irreparable harm to the brain and body.
"The brain and body have been subjected to a constant barrage of trauma, leading to significant distress."
The repeated exposure to trauma has left the brain and body in a state of chronic pain and dysfunction.
"my symptoms of PMDD (anxiety, low mood, low energy, agitation, dp/dr) mostly show up right before my period, become worse right after and goes on/off in waves until after ovulation"
My PMDD symptoms are at their worst in the week leading up to my period and the first few days after.
"I experience a rollercoaster of PMDD symptoms, with the most intense period being right before and after my period."
"My anxiety, low mood, and low energy really ramp up in the days before my period and then subside after ovulation."
"The PMDD symptoms I experience, like anxiety, low mood, and agitation, tend to peak right before my period and then gradually fade after ovulation."
"The cyclical nature of my PMDD means that I usually experience the most severe symptoms right before and after my period, with some fluctuation in between."
"I have bpd type actions and feelings during this week. I tend to make bad choices, drink more to chill out the buzzing over excited energy. It’s uncomfortably high. Sometimes I prefer the depression side bc I’m sad but it’s not this uncontrollable reckless feeling."
"This week, I've been experiencing mood swings that are typical of my BPD. I make impulsive decisions and turn to alcohol to manage the overwhelming energy."
"The manic energy is so intense that I crave the peace of depression. At least then, the sadness is a steady feeling, not this chaotic, reckless one."
"I feel like I'm walking a tightrope between extreme highs and lows. This week, the high is making me reckless and anxious."
"I'm caught in this cycle of impulsive behavior and anxiety. It's exhausting, and I just want the constant buzzing to stop."
"The highs are so intense that I'm seeking ways to bring myself down. It's like I'm afraid of the high, but I'm also afraid of the lows."
"I’ve been crying for the past 3 hours. Had to drive home and I was hyperventilating, literally shaking so hard in the car screaming crying. I feel a bit better writing this but yeah maybe I’ll cry some more later"
I'm still trying to process everything and it's making me feel physically sick.
"I can't stop thinking about it, it's like a constant loop in my head."
"I just feel so overwhelmed and helpless, I don't know what to do."
I just want to disappear and hide from the world right now.
It feels like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders.
I spiralled at one point when I couldn't find my shoes and then again later about basically nothing and my partner had enough and went home without me. I then threw a drunken pity party and had a really terrible night crying about him leaving me alone when I was in so much emotional pain.
"I had a complete meltdown when I couldn't find my keys and then again later over a completely trivial matter, and my friend had enough and just left."
"I was spiraling out of control when my phone died and then again later about something completely insignificant, and my roommate finally gave up and went to bed."
"I lost it when I spilled my coffee and then again later about something completely absurd, and my date decided it was time to go home."
"I had a total breakdown when I missed my train and then again later when I realized I left my wallet at home, and my best friend just walked away."
"I felt like I was going crazy when I couldn't remember where I parked and then again later over something totally meaningless, and my husband just sighed and left me to myself."
I'm chronically depressed and think about the bad stuff I shouldn't do. I constantly feel like breaking off friendships and burning bridges just because I'm irritable..I feel so angry over little things. I feel like I'm getting manic again. I won't let myself lose my sense of reality again..I'm so tired. I'm really depressed..I can't even take care of myself..I just want to go back to work..have a purpose..not be constantly wanting to just never wake up..I'm not suicidal.. just tired..sad.. not wanting to deal with this anymore..my depression is so bad I can't even get up to exercise..no motivation..
"I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of negativity, constantly battling with my own thoughts."
It's hard to see the light when you're always focusing on the darkness.
My anger and frustration feel so overwhelming that I just want to lash out at everyone.
"I'm so exhausted from fighting this internal battle, I just want to escape."
"I feel like I'm losing myself to this depression, and I don't know how to get back."
I tried to drive my car off of a bridge this morning. When I didn’t do it I felt like such a loser. I’ve never been in a depression this bad I’ve never been this lonely this scared and this empty. I was hit by an 18 wheeler on Tuesday. I just can’t cope anymore. I literally just cannot cope. I have an hour drive to work and I cried the entire time. I was so mad when that 18 wheeler didn’t just kill me. I’ve got to find a way to get out of this life. ETA: I knew something was wrong. I knew it on a cellular level. I really came close to leaving. I still yearn for release but I have set up preliminary treatment and I may go inpatient. I am beyond sad. I thought I had a life partner. I tried so hard for soooo long - anything he wanted me to be I would be. It was never right. I was never right.
"I'm just so tired, I'm so drained. I don't know how much more of this I can take."
It feels like I'm drowning in despair. Like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from.
Every day is a struggle. Every moment is a struggle. I just want to escape.
"I feel so empty, so hollow. Like a shell of the person I used to be."
"I know I need help, I know I need to get better, but I just don't know where to start."
I have just been prescribed SSRI’s for my PMDD.
"I've been dealing with the symptoms of PMDD for a while now, and I'm hoping these SSRIs will help."
My doctor thinks these SSRIs could help manage the emotional swings I experience with PMDD.
"It's a relief to finally have a treatment plan for my PMDD, and I'm hopeful about these SSRIs."
"I've been feeling really overwhelmed by PMDD lately, so I'm glad to have some medication to help me cope."
"I'm a bit nervous about starting these SSRIs, but I'm willing to try anything to find relief from my PMDD."
"Sometimes I feel the pmdd symptoms right after my period ends, such as depression, anxiety, migraines, very low energy. After my period I get a few days of feeling low and depressed"
I find that I get the worst of the PMDD symptoms in the days immediately following my period.
The transition from my period to my regular cycle can be really rough because of the PMDD symptoms.
"Even though my period is over, I can still feel the lingering effects of PMDD for several days afterward."
"I always feel so exhausted and drained for a few days after my period ends, and I think it's because of the PMDD."
"Those first few days after my period are the worst because I'm so moody, anxious, and tired."
"Constant night sweats, a migraine for three days, the inability to eat, nausea, absolute rage... I started craving food again, I ate a full meal, and I slept through the night with minimal sweat."
"The chills, the weakness, the constant fatigue... I finally felt a sliver of energy, enough to take a walk outside."
"The dizziness, the blurred vision, the throbbing in my head... It was finally gone, replaced by a clear, calm mind."
"The aches, the pains, the endless coughing... I woke up this morning feeling stronger, more myself."
"The constant fear, the overwhelming sadness, the crippling anxiety... It started to recede, replaced by a sense of hope."
"The endless crying, the sleepless nights, the feeling of emptiness...  It finally started to fade, leaving a sense of peace in its wake."
"I barely slept last night and am now feeling incredibly overwhelmed with life, everything seems too hard."
"I feel so burnt out and stressed, everything just feels like too much right now."
I'm exhausted and feeling like I can't keep up with everything. It all feels impossible.
My mind is racing and I can't seem to find any peace. It feels like I'm drowning in everything I have to do.
I feel like I'm constantly on edge and can't seem to relax. Everything just feels overwhelming.
I'm so tired of struggling and feeling like I'm failing. It feels like I'm constantly pushing against a brick wall.
"PMDD has almost betrayed my silence so many times over the past few days. I hear what this bastard is doing and my blood boils so hard that I can hear it. Currently in guilt-stricken PMDD meltdown because I called him out on his bullshit and he was very convincing of his 'innocence,' but he is actually attempting to gaslight me by saying I imagined everything. Now I am questioning my sanity but not my conviction and this is NOT a good time"
"The rage I'm feeling from PMDD is making me want to scream at him, but I keep getting talked out of it."
"This PMDD is making me so sensitive, I can barely handle his lies."
"I just know he's being dishonest, but I feel so guilty and overwhelmed by PMDD right now."
"I hate how my PMDD makes me question my own instincts, especially when he's being so manipulative."
"I'm in a constant struggle with my PMDD and his gaslighting, and I don't know how much longer I can take it."
"pushing through the luteal struggle by just working out, staying busy, and keeping engaged with society"
"I'm trying to get through this luteal phase by keeping myself active, busy, and connected with people."
"Working out, staying busy, and engaging with society are helping me push through this luteal struggle."
"I'm focusing on exercise, staying busy, and social interaction to manage the challenges of the luteal phase."
"I'm finding that physical activity, staying busy, and staying connected are key to getting through the luteal phase."
"I'm using exercise, a busy schedule, and social engagement to power through the difficult luteal phase."
"I know full well that rotting in bed and doomscrolling to the point of paralysis only makes the anxiety and apathy worse, but it’s the only thing I “feel like doing” when my PMS rolls around. ... So i resort back to waiting it out and self-isolating. ... Don’t feel like disturbing them and don’t feel like I’m “depressed” enough to feel like I need to reach out to them for any “help” — it’s bound to come around every month anyway. 😞"
"I know that I should be getting out and exercising, but all I want to do is stay in bed and watch TV when I'm feeling down."
"I know that I shouldn't be eating junk food, but it's the only thing that makes me feel better when I'm stressed."
"I know that I should be talking to someone about how I'm feeling, but I just don't feel like it right now."
"I know that I should be trying to be productive, but I just can't seem to motivate myself when I'm feeling this way."
"I know that I should be taking care of myself, but it's just so hard when I'm feeling this low."
struggling with PMDD symptoms
I'm really struggling with PMDD symptoms this month.
These PMDD symptoms are making it really hard to function.
I'm feeling so overwhelmed by my PMDD symptoms.
The PMDD symptoms are really taking a toll on me.
I'm hoping these PMDD symptoms will subside soon.
My legs are numb ibuprofen isn’t working and I feel like vomiting but I feel like it isn’t appropriate to go home because of cramps but I feel like dying
"I'm in so much pain, I can barely move, and I feel awful, but I don't want to leave work because of the cramps."
"I'm feeling so sick and dizzy, but I don't want to go home because I'm worried about what people will think."
"I can't stand the pain anymore, but I can't seem to bring myself to go home."
"This is the worst I've ever felt, but I don't want to let my coworkers down."
"I'm going to be sick, I'm so uncomfortable, but I just want to tough it out."
"Noticed in late 2023 that the PMDD was breaking through, so I bumped my Prozac up to 20 mg. Then around June of this year, yep, it's getting worse again."
"I've been struggling with PMDD, and it seems to be getting worse again."
It feels like the PMDD is back in full force.
I've had to adjust my medication because the PMDD is so bad.
The PMDD is really taking a toll on me lately.
I'm starting to feel like I'm back to square one with the PMDD.
why can’t I feel this full of energy and this happy for the whole month?
I wish I could feel this energetic and happy all the time.
Why does this feeling of happiness and energy have to be so fleeting?
I want to bottle up this feeling and keep it forever.
It's like this joy and energy are just a temporary visitor.
I wish I could live in this moment of happiness and energy forever.
"I had to opt for an SNRI (pristiq) because it makes me clinch my jaw. So far, I've been on celexa, zoloft, cymbalta, and now pristiq."
"I've tried so many antidepressants, but pristiq is the only one that seems to help with my jaw clenching."
I'm hoping that pristiq will be the one that finally works for me.
I'm really hoping pristiq works because I'm tired of trying new meds.
"It's frustrating to have to keep trying different medications, but I'm determined to find something that works."
I'm trying to stay positive and hope that pristiq will be the answer to my problems.
"I am calmer when I am on it, I have no sex drive, I am more tired during that time. I get really depressed during my period these past few months while taking prozac."
"Prozac seems to be affecting my mood in a way that I don't like, particularly during my period."
"I've been feeling more down than usual, especially when I'm on my period, even though I'm taking Prozac."
"I'm experiencing heightened depression during my period, and I'm wondering if it's related to the Prozac."
"I'm noticing a pattern of increased depression during my period, which is unusual for me, and I think the Prozac might be contributing."
"I feel like the Prozac is making my period symptoms worse, especially the emotional ones."
"I get cramps, bloating, lower left back pain, old injury inflammation and diarrhea. The mental is self doubt, isolation, thoughts of end of life, paranoia, feeling unloveable, overwhelmed by simple tasks, start several projects I can’t finish and disasterbation."
"I'm constantly battling physical discomfort – cramps, bloating, back pain, and digestive issues – but the mental struggle is even harder. It's a constant cycle of self-doubt, isolation, morbid thoughts, paranoia, and feeling completely worthless."
"My body is a battlefield. I'm dealing with pain, inflammation, and digestive problems, but it's the emotional turmoil that really takes its toll. I feel disconnected, lost in a maze of anxieties, and convinced that I'm beyond help."
"The physical symptoms are bad enough – cramps, bloating, pain – but the real struggle is in my mind. I'm overwhelmed with self-doubt, paranoia, and the constant fear of being unlovable."
"It's a vicious cycle of pain and despair. My body betrays me with cramps, bloating, and inflammation, while my mind is consumed by self-doubt, isolation, and the overwhelming feeling of being trapped."
"I'm drowning in a sea of pain and uncertainty. My body is riddled with physical discomfort, and my mind is a dark place of self-doubt, paranoia, and a constant struggle to cope."
anxious spiraling tornado
Endişelerimin bir kasırga gibi beni yuttuğu hissiyle dolmuş hissediyorum.
Duygularım kontrolsüz bir şekilde dönüyor ve beni içine çekiyor.
"Zihnim, bir hortumun şiddetiyle kontrolsüz bir şekilde dönüyor."
"Sanki düşüncelerim etrafımda dönen bir kasırga gibi, beni durmaksızın sürüklüyor."
"Kontrolsüz bir şekilde dönen endişelerim, beni uçurup götürecek bir hortuma benziyor."
which stage of the cycle I’m at rn lmao
"I'm wondering which stage of the cycle I'm in right now, haha"
"What stage of the cycle am I in, I'm curious lol"
"I can't remember what stage of the cycle I'm in, I'm so lost"
"I have no idea what stage of the cycle I'm at rn, lol"
"Am I in the luteal phase or the follicular phase, I have no clue, lmao"
I feel annoying for complaining about this every month to my boyfriend... I feel like he takes it less serious every time I get like this... I FEEL SO ANNOYING. Like I just want to be NORMAL. I don't have to feel happy all the time but I want to not feel depressed half of my adult life.
I feel so pathetic for complaining about the same things over and over again.
It's like he's getting tired of hearing my struggles and doesn't even try to understand anymore.
"I hate feeling like a burden, like I'm constantly bringing him down."
"I just want to be happy and carefree, but I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity."
"Maybe I'm just too sensitive and overreacting, but I can't help but feel like something's wrong."
"I'm paranoid that no one like me, I try to get into discussions but my thoughts are always 'No one wants to hear you', 'you would talk too much', 'youre weird'. I'm worried about what everyone will think of me. Been feeling like this for a while and with my period 2 days away I feel like I'm spiraling and I want to go home and get under the blankets and never come out."
"I'm so scared of being judged, I feel like everyone thinks I'm strange and annoying."
"I hate this feeling of being invisible, like my thoughts don't matter and nobody cares what I have to say."
"My anxiety is through the roof, I'm constantly overthinking everything and worrying about what people will think of me."
"I just want to disappear, I feel so overwhelmed and I just want to hide away from the world."
"It's like my own mind is against me, telling me I'm not good enough and that I should just stay silent."
"I want to take a hammer to my fiance's computer... Just isolate myself completely. I don't want friends, family, or love. I just want to be me."
"I'm so tired of everything, I just want to disappear."
I just want to shut everything out and be alone with my thoughts.
"I feel like I need to escape all of this, just for a little while."
"I need some time to myself, away from everyone and everything."
I'm feeling overwhelmed and I just need to get away.
I've been stuck in luteal even though I seem to have gone back to a normalish cycle. I had one period 3 weeks after stopping and was expecting the relief when it arrived only to have symptoms intensify and get hit with the worst depression and anxiety of my life.
"I'm so frustrated because I was hoping to be out of the luteal phase, but my symptoms are actually worse than ever."
It's really hard to deal with the roller coaster of emotions and physical symptoms that come with my cycle.
"The relief I felt when my period arrived was short-lived, as the depression and anxiety only got worse."
"I'm starting to feel like this luteal phase is never going to end, which is really scary."
"It's so confusing because I thought I was finally back to normal, but now I'm struggling more than ever."
my wife F35 has been experiencing severe PMDD symptoms since a few years. It has gotten especially worse since the birth of our second child 2 years ago.
"My wife's PMDD symptoms have been really bad for a while now, but they've gotten much worse since we had our second baby."
"Since our youngest was born, my wife's been struggling more with her PMDD. It's been a tough couple of years."
"I don't know how my wife manages with her PMDD, especially since our second child was born. It's definitely gotten tougher."
"The PMDD has been hard on my wife for years, but it's definitely been worse since we had our second baby."
"It's been a struggle for my wife, she's been dealing with PMDD for a while now, and it's gotten worse since the baby was born."
"I feel like the world is ending, everything pisses me off, I am unnecessarily mean and reactive to basic things, etc."
I'm in a really bad mood and taking it out on everyone around me.
"I'm feeling so overwhelmed and stressed, I can't even handle the simplest things."
"Everything feels like a huge deal right now, and I'm being way too sensitive to everything."
"I'm at my breaking point, and I don't know how to deal with it."
I just want to crawl under a rock and disappear until I feel better.
I feel anger and numb all in one
I am filled with a strange mix of rage and apathy.
"It's like my emotions are frozen, except for this burning anger."
"I can't shake the feeling of being numb, but it's also making me furious."
"This anger is so intense, but I feel completely detached from it."
"I'm just a shell, but this anger is the only thing that feels real."
I look like an old hag who doesn’t moisturize and hasn’t slept in days.
"I'm starting to look like a zombie, I haven't had a decent night's sleep in ages."
"I look so haggard, like I've been through a war, and not the good kind."
"My skin is drier than the Sahara Desert, I need a major moisture boost."
"I feel like I'm aging in fast-forward, I look like I'm 10 years older than I actually am."
"I look like I haven't seen a mirror in months, I need to get myself together."
I finally went to the ER last night because my doctor didn't know what to do with me anymore... I waited 12 hours in the ER hoping to see the psychiatrist on call but what I got instead was an old white doctor telling me that I'm probably depressed...
"I went to the ER after my doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, and all I got was a lecture about being depressed."
"After waiting 12 hours in the ER, I saw a doctor who told me I was probably depressed, even though I went for a different issue."
"My doctor couldn't help me, so I went to the ER, but the doctor there just told me I was depressed."
"I finally went to the ER because my doctor was stumped, but the doctor there didn't even bother trying to figure it out - just told me I was depressed."
"I waited for hours in the ER hoping for help, but all I got was a judgmental diagnosis of depression."
"I have pretty severe PMDD and it keeps getting worse with age. ...it is debilitating me, ...I'm able to talk myself out of any self harm, which is good don't get me wrong but it doesn't do anything to actually de-escalate me. It really interferes with my life, my mental health, my relationships..."
"PMDD is seriously impacting my life, and it's getting harder to manage as I get older."
"I feel like I'm constantly struggling with PMDD, and it's getting worse, making it harder to function."
"My PMDD is so intense that I'm barely able to cope, and it's making me feel hopeless."
"It's a constant battle to deal with my PMDD, and it's taking a toll on my mental and emotional health."
"The effects of PMDD are getting more severe, and I'm worried about how it's affecting my overall well-being."
I’ve been losing it with my kids and then having to deal with the shame after the rage passes... I keep imagining what will happen when the four cousins eventually get into some annoying fight and I enter in a rage or if I get mad at something my BIL says and lose it.
I'm at my wit's end with the kids and it just feels so embarrassing when the anger subsides.
"I'm really struggling to keep my cool with the kids, and I can't even imagine what I'll do when the cousins all get into a fight and I lose it."
"I feel like I'm on a short fuse lately, and I worry about what will happen if I go off on my brother-in-law or if something the kids do sets me off."
"I'm so overwhelmed with the kids and my temper is getting the best of me, it's terrifying to think about what might happen when we're all together."
"I'm trying my best to control myself, but I'm afraid I'm going to lose it completely at some point and there will be major consequences."
"I gained weight, became unmotivated, depressed, enraged. Constant meltdowns, unable to do anything. I hate my boyfriend, I can't enjoy sex, I can't get anything done, I fear I'll never be able to go back to go to school, that I'll just terrorize my partner till he leaves me."
"My entire life feels like a black hole, sucking in every ounce of happiness I ever had."
I can't even recognize myself anymore. It's like I'm a stranger trapped in my own body.
"Every day feels like an uphill battle against my own mind and body, and I'm losing."
"I'm so consumed by these negative emotions that I can't see a way out. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark, endless tunnel."
"I just want to be happy again, but it feels like that's impossible now. I don't know who I am anymore, and I'm terrified of what the future holds."
wake up one day and feel intense guilt and paranoia that your friends and colleagues despise you or want you fired... you just can’t shake the feeling you’re an irritating human being who says and does awful things... this consistent irrational anxiety... I have panic attacks sometimes. It’s hard to rationalise it and it’s so intrusive and all consuming
"I've been feeling this crippling guilt and paranoia lately, like everyone around me secretly hates me or wants me gone. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, convinced that everyone thinks I'm a terrible person."
"There are times when I feel so anxious and paranoid, convinced that my friends and coworkers are secretly plotting against me. I just can't shake this feeling that I'm constantly doing or saying the wrong thing."

"My libido is nonexistent on this medication, and my anxiety, depression, and PMDD symptoms have returned with a vengeance."
I am trying to just flow with the waves of hormones rather than fight against it and try to be at my best when I can't be. What if we looked at luteal as the time we are supposed to take a step back and feel all the hard feelings?
"I think it's okay to not be at my best all the time, especially during luteal phase, when our hormones are naturally lower."
"Maybe we should embrace the ebb and flow of our hormones instead of fighting against it, allowing ourselves to feel the lows as well as the highs."
"Instead of trying to be 'on' all the time, what if we accepted that luteal phase is a time for rest and reflection?"
"Perhaps the luteal phase isn't a time to be pushing ourselves, but rather a time to listen to our bodies and allow ourselves to experience the emotions that come with it."
"It's almost like luteal phase is a reminder that it's okay to not be perfect, and that sometimes the best thing we can do is surrender to the moment."
when I’m showering and causally start thinking that I’m a waste of space and nothing will ever be right again
I sometimes catch myself feeling hopeless and useless while I'm in the shower.

"it manifests the most in my relationship (trust issues, doubting the relationship, doubting my feelings, being very nasty and mean, etc)... I become extremely stressed and feel like my whole world is crashing down on me and there’s no way out. OCD seems to get pretty bad, I go on a cleaning rampage, the placement of the paper towels will literally bother me. Then of course on top of all of that the suicidal ideations start."

I need to invest in some sort of anti-gravity field or something. I was trying to reach for a cookie and knocked over the whole jar. It's a good thing I love cookies.
I feel normal only a week out of the month. The rest of the month... I think I don’t even need to explain how horrible they are. I've been sleepy 24/7 since last Wednesday... it takes so much effort to even do basic living tasks.

I'm feeling really down and overwhelmed with everything. I just want to curl up in bed and disappear for a while.

"Uykuya dalmaya çalışırken, anksiyeteyle felç olmuştum. Burada ve orada küçük işler yapıyordum, ancak içimdeki anksiyete ve öz nefret beni tüketiyordu."

PMDD holds my brain hostage and makes me feel like something is cognitively wrong with me. It’s always so difficult to communicate my thoughts and remember small things when any other time it would be easy for me. There’s this cloud that just prevents me from thinking and it sucks.

"I know I need to work on myself, but it's so hard when I feel so exhausted and stressed all the time."
I'm wondering for those of you who treat your PMDD effectively (or even somewhat effectively) what works for you that isn’t the pill?
I'm curious what other options are available for managing PMDD that don't involve medication.
"For those who've found ways to handle PMDD without medication, what techniques have been most helpful?"
Are there any natural or alternative approaches that have proven effective in dealing with PMDD?

"I'm worried about all these symptoms, but still no period.  Could the repeated UTIs be messing with my cycle?"

"I don't know what's going on, but I've been having a lot of UTIs and now I have blood in my urine.  I'm scared it might be affecting my cycle."

"My 'hell week' pattern starts with a familiar suicidal ideation, followed by debilitating insomnia - i become so physically anxious and restless that i can't relax my body enough to sleep no matter how tired i am. Then the 2/3 days before my period i become so paranoid and delusional i used to worry i was schizophrenic."
"My body starts to feel like it's falling apart during the week before my period, I have no energy to do anything and my mind just races with anxiety."

I want to cry and cry and cry but the antidepressants I’m on just make me feel numb. Every little inconvenience makes me blindingly angry and upset.

how can I reduce my stress when my hormones make everything feel stressful? How can I eat healthier when my cravings are out of this world?

"I've been paying attention, and for a year now, my acid reflux has gotten really bad during Luteal phase and then tapers off and improves during follocular... I also just got my hearing tested.  I'm normal in my left ear, but during luteal I get ringing in my ear (tinnitis) and pain due to pressure and I can't hear much... I haven't talked to my primary care dr about these results yet... Is it the acid that is causing the sleep apnea and the hearing loss/pressure?  or is it something else?  I'm worried though that that appointment will be during a good week and I won't have the symptoms."

"I start to get really depressed, quit exercising, cut everyone off in my life and become a sad lonely couch potato. This leads me to stop eating and severely restrict my calories as a way to punish myself for failing at everything else I’m doing. A few days into this I get the wildest most intense cravings you can imagine and absolutely go insane on everything junk food and not, and I feel completely out of control. This of course leads me to purge and completely hate myself for doing it, but I almost physically can’t make myself stop for anywhere from 1-5 days."

When do you typically see weight gain or weight loss happen?
I'm interested in identifying the periods when weight gain or loss occurs.

"I have tried supplements like vitex, evening primrose oil, mirena, wellbutrin, and probably other things. ... I felt a subtle push in the opposite direction. It wasn’t like I was in high spirits or feeling amazing, but I was also not feeling super shitty or easily irritated or depressed. "

I feel like I'm going nowhere.
I'm stuck in a cycle that I can't break.
I feel like I'm in a dead end job.
exhausted with muscle soreness & migraines
I'm completely worn out from sore muscles and a pounding headache.
"My body is aching and my head is throbbing, I just want to sleep."
This muscle soreness and migraine are making it impossible to function.
"I feel like I'm dragging myself through molasses, my muscles are killing me and I've got a splitting headache."
"I'm so exhausted, I can barely move because of the muscle soreness and the migraine is making me feel terrible."
"symptoms I experience throughout the month that are manageable, suddenly become exacerbated and extremely difficult to manage so I become what feels as though a completely different."
I feel like a completely different person when my usually manageable symptoms suddenly become unbearable.
My manageable symptoms escalate to the point where I feel like a different person.
"The change in my symptoms is so drastic, I feel like I'm living in a different body."
"It's like a switch flips, and my symptoms become so intense I feel like I've become someone else."
The sudden shift in the severity of my symptoms leaves me feeling like a completely different individual.
"i’ve been dealing with PMDD for 3 years, and finally got diagnosed earlier this year. i’ve delt with it for so long and i’m so tired. i feel like i’m a burden on them as well. everything just feels like it’s too much. i get so depressed a week before my period starts, and it doesn’t go away when my period ends. i end up feeling like the only way to end this… well.. i’m so much better than i was 3 years ago, but so much worse in so many different aspects. i’ve lost friends, my appetite has changed. i’ve lost so much weight and my mental health just keeps declining. there’s only so much weekly therapy sessions can do. there’s only so much my boyfriend can handle. i’m just really exhausted."
I'm really struggling with the impact of PMDD on my life. It feels like I'm constantly battling against something I can't control.
The emotional roller coaster of PMDD has taken a toll on me. I feel like I'm losing myself in the process.
I'm so tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me. I just want to be able to function normally again.
It's hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel when the darkness of PMDD feels so overwhelming.
"I'm trying to stay positive, but it's difficult when every month feels like a battle against my own body and mind."
"I struggled to eat something „normal“ and could eat candy for dinner. ...I became a sugar/food junkie. Without the sugar, my anxiety even went away 😓😭😭"
My body craved sweets so badly that I would happily eat candy for dinner.
I was so addicted to sugar that I couldn't imagine eating anything else.
"The thought of a 'normal' meal made me nauseous, all I wanted was sugar."
"My anxiety would disappear when I ate sugar, it was like a drug."
"I couldn't control my sugar cravings, it felt like an out-of-body experience."

"The man's history of domestic violence, stemming from his untreated mental illness, left his wife fearing for her safety."

"I'm feeling hopeless and like I want to give up, is this part of my normal cycle or is something else going on?"
"I'm exhausted and emotional, is this PMS or is something else making me feel this way?"
"This feeling of dread and despair is so heavy, I can't tell if it's just my mood or something more serious."
"Everything feels so overwhelming and I feel like I'm going to break down, is this just my hormones or is there something else I need to address?"
I feel like this one was so much more rage filled
This one definitely had more rage than the others.
This one really made me feel angry.
"This one was filled with so much anger, it was almost overwhelming."
This one just made me want to scream.
I think this one is the most rage-inducing out of all of them.
I went insane a couple months ago...anger denial and mood swings. I’m talking mountains and trenches not hills and valleys.
"My emotions have been all over the place, it's like I'm on a rollercoaster of feelings."
"I've been experiencing intense highs and lows, it's almost like a switch flips in my head."
"The anger, denial, and mood swings are overwhelming, it's like a storm raging inside me."
"I feel like I'm on the edge of a volcano, ready to erupt at any moment."
"The intensity of my emotions is unlike anything I've ever experienced, it's like a tidal wave crashing over me."
I have excruciating period pain and also fatigue and depression the second half of my cycle... the rage that comes out due to PMDD is probably as a result of repressed rage... my body has been in a constant flight or fight mode due to my traumatic childhood.
"My period pain is so bad, and then I also feel exhausted and depressed, especially in the second half of my cycle. I think the anger I get from PMDD comes from all the anger I've kept inside."
"I experience intense pain during my period, along with fatigue and depression, particularly during the latter half of my cycle. I believe the rage associated with PMDD stems from suppressed anger that I haven't been able to express."

"I'm struggling with excruciating period pain, fatigue, and depression, especially in the second half of my cycle. I think the anger I feel with PMDD is because of the trauma I experienced in my childhood."
I started getting PMDD type symptoms when I began seeking help for the trauma that gave me PTSD
The therapy sessions I started for my trauma triggered PMDD-like symptoms.
"As I began addressing the trauma that caused my PTSD, I started experiencing PMDD symptoms."
"My PTSD treatment inadvertently triggered PMDD symptoms, which was unexpected."
Seeking help for my PTSD led to the emergence of PMDD-like symptoms.
The process of healing from trauma brought about the onset of PMDD-like symptoms.
"I went through a period of severe emotional trauma and I went from normal pms to severe, excruciating, debilitating, horrible, terrible, PMDD"
"I went through a really rough patch, and my usual PMS symptoms turned into something way worse."
"My emotional state was a complete wreck, and my normal premenstrual symptoms turned into something absolutely debilitating."
"I experienced extreme emotional distress, and what used to be mild PMS transformed into a brutal experience."
"My mental health plummeted, and my typical PMS symptoms became excruciatingly painful and debilitating."
"I went through a period of immense emotional turmoil, and my normal PMS symptoms turned into something unbearable."
naturopaths I went to had absolutely no clue about PMDD.. one even put me on progesterone cream… later figured out I’m progesterone intolerant..
"I consulted a couple of naturopaths, but they seemed to have no idea what PMDD was."
"The naturopaths I saw were completely clueless about PMDD, one even prescribed progesterone cream, which I later discovered I couldn't tolerate."
"It was frustrating to find out that the naturopaths I went to knew nothing about PMDD, and one of them even gave me progesterone cream that I was intolerant to."
"The lack of knowledge about PMDD among the naturopaths I saw was astounding, one even recommended progesterone cream, which I later learned I couldn't handle."
"I was disappointed to learn that the naturopaths I consulted were uninformed about PMDD, one of them even put me on a progesterone cream, which I later realized I had a negative reaction to."
"I never even really had PMS before going through two traumatic events back to back, then went into what I suspect is full blown PMDD."
I had no idea what PMDD was until I experienced two major life stressors in a row.
I didn't even know what PMS was until I went through a period of intense emotional upheaval.
"Before the traumatic events, I never really struggled with my menstrual cycle."
It was only after the back-to-back traumas that I realized how severely my mood was affected by my period.
"I suspect I've always had PMDD, but the traumas triggered the full blown symptoms."

I have CPTSD and whenever I get sick with a cold or flu (or even something as small as falling or stubbing my toe) I have a very strong emotional response.
"I'm so sensitive to physical discomfort, even a minor injury can trigger a huge emotional response."
My CPTSD makes me react very strongly to illness or even minor physical pain.
"It's like my body is constantly on high alert, even the smallest things can set off a panic."

My emotional responses are so heightened that even a simple cold can feel like a major crisis.
"I have ADHD and was undiagnosed for my whole life until I was 22. It led to a whole life of anxiety disorders, insomnia, struggles in school and university, and a really low self esteem because I couldn't keep up with everyone else."
"I was constantly struggling with my attention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity, but nobody ever suspected I had ADHD."
"It was a constant battle to stay focused and organized, and I felt like I was always lagging behind everyone else."
"The lack of diagnosis and support left me feeling lost, overwhelmed, and deeply insecure."
"I never realized why I was so different, why I had such a hard time with school, or why I always felt like I was failing."
The constant pressure to fit in and succeed only fueled my anxiety and made me feel even more inadequate.
"I also heavily suffer from PMDD and its curious that it be connected to PTSD, which I also have, but after years of bodily and mentally conditioning of fight or flight mode, I have serious doubts that processing repressed trauma will change the body’s biochemistry or sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations."
"I've been dealing with PMDD for a long time, and it's fascinating that it might be linked to my PTSD. It's been a constant struggle to manage the fight-or-flight response, so I'm not convinced that simply processing trauma will magically fix my body's hormonal reactions."
"The connection between PMDD and PTSD is intriguing, but I'm not optimistic that simply addressing past trauma will solve the underlying biochemical issues. My body has been in survival mode for so long, it's deeply ingrained."
"My PMDD is severe, and it's interesting that it could be related to my PTSD. However, after years of constantly being on high alert, I'm not sure how much unpacking the past can actually change my body's hormonal sensitivity."
"It's no coincidence that PMDD and PTSD are linked, but I'm skeptical about whether addressing trauma alone can reverse the physiological effects of years of stress. My body has become highly reactive, and I'm not sure that therapy alone can change that."
"I'm not holding my breath for a quick fix for PMDD, especially given its possible link to PTSD.  Years of constant stress have taken a toll on my body, and I'm not convinced that simply talking about my past trauma will rewire my hormonal responses."
"I would notice that the same emotional stress triggers for me would come up every couple of cycles. For me this was a deep feeling of abandonment/ being very alone, no self worth and hopelessness."
"I realized that the same emotional triggers would reappear regularly, making me feel deeply abandoned, alone, worthless, and hopeless."
"Every few cycles, I'd experience the same intense emotions of abandonment, loneliness, and a lack of self-worth, leading to a feeling of hopelessness."
"It was like clockwork, the same emotional triggers would resurface, leaving me feeling utterly abandoned, alone, and without any value, drowning in despair."
"I noticed a recurring pattern where the same emotional triggers would bring up feelings of abandonment, loneliness, lack of self-worth, and a deep sense of hopelessness."
"The same emotional stressors would consistently come up, leaving me feeling completely alone, abandoned, worthless, and filled with despair."
ever since I started going to therapy for my CPTSD... I get most of my flashbacks the two weeks before my period too… it sucks cause they make me feel even more anxious and stressed
"I've been noticing a lot more flashbacks lately, especially in the weeks leading up to my period."
"It's like my CPTSD symptoms are amplified right before my period, which makes everything feel so much harder."
"The anxiety and stress I feel during those flashbacks is just overwhelming, it's like I'm reliving everything all over again."
"It's so frustrating that my body is making my mental health worse, it's like I have no control over it."
"I'm really hoping my therapist can help me find ways to manage these flashbacks, especially during those difficult weeks."

I'm drowning in work this week and I feel so bad about the bad architecture I sent to the customer.
It's been a super stressful week and it's so frustrating that I can't seem to escape this awful draft I sent out.
"I'm going through a really tough time right now, I sent a really bad draft to the client and now I can't think about anything else."
"I'm in a terrible situation right now, my work is going terribly and I'm so upset about the bad draft I sent to the customer."
"I started to notice my depression,anxiety,ocd,and temper would get way more prevalent during my period"
"My mood swings, anxiety, and obsessive thoughts would always get worse right before my period."
"I felt like my emotions were completely out of control, especially during that time of the month."
It's like my mental health took a nosedive every time I got my period.
"The anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms would always be amplified during my cycle."
"I was constantly battling these emotional ups and downs, particularly when I was menstruating."
"I dread it and hope to make it through alive, literally, but I know what is coming towards me."
"I'm scared of what's coming, but I have to face it head-on."
"It's terrifying, but I have to push through this somehow."
"This is a dangerous situation, but I'll try my best to survive."
"I know what's coming, and it's terrifying, but I'll do everything I can to make it through."
"I'm not looking forward to what's coming, but I have to be ready for it."
I’m just frustrated that women have been suffering from them for years and yet the best advice doctors can give is literally not helpful to the majority of women and can even cause more problems for them. I’m tired of people saying cramps are normal. Why is it normal for me to not be able to do anything for a week every month? Sorry for the rant currently missing out on vacation because of a poorly timed period and feeling very sad/angry about it.
"I don't understand why we have to put up with this every month, it's not normal to be in so much pain."
"It's so frustrating that there's no real solution for this, it feels like we're just expected to suffer."
"I'm so sick of hearing that cramps are just 'normal,' it's not normal to be completely incapacitated for days."
"It's not fair that I have to miss out on things because of my period, it feels like I'm constantly being punished."
"I just want to feel like I have control over my own body, but it feels like I'm at the mercy of my hormones."
I start to doubt all my decisions... No light. Just all consuming darkness. ...It's the loneliest state one can be in I would argue.
"I'm overwhelmed with uncertainty about everything I've done. It's like a heavy fog, smothering any hope."
"Every choice I've made feels wrong, like I'm trapped in a void with no escape."
"This feeling of isolation is crushing, it's like being trapped in a black hole."
"I'm drowning in self-doubt, every thought is consumed by darkness, leaving me completely alone."
"It's this agonizing sense of being utterly lost, completely alone, with no path forward."
"I feel crazy. I’ve cried more in the past few weeks than I have in years, I feel a dark sense of looming doom, I feel like I can’t think straight, I’m getting no sleep no matter how much I try, I’m having hot flashes, nausea, and vomiting, I feel passively suicidal and intrusive thoughts, I have noticed I’m talking fast and without a filter, and my anxiety is either through the roof or I feel loopy like I’m on drugs"
I'm in a state of complete emotional turmoil.
It feels like my body and mind are betraying me.
I'm overwhelmed with a sense of hopelessness and dread.
"My thoughts are racing, and I can't seem to focus."
I'm struggling to cope with the overwhelming amount of stress I'm experiencing.
"I did not sleep the entire week, and the lack of sleep worsened my emotional state immensely. I just started lexapro in hope that I find a bit of relief for the anxiety and depression"
"I'm exhausted, I haven't slept properly in days, and I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed by everything."
"I've been feeling so anxious and depressed lately, and the lack of sleep is making it even worse. I'm hoping this medication will help."
"I'm at my wit's end, the sleep deprivation is pushing me to the brink. I'm desperately hoping this new medication will provide some relief."
"I'm completely drained, I haven't gotten a wink of sleep all week, and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I'm putting my trust in this medication to help."
"My anxiety and depression have been through the roof lately, and the sleeplessness is making it impossible to cope. I'm hoping this medication will be the turning point."
"I'm so anxious and stormy. It's something I try to control and hide but it feels like a losing game, they've already made their minds up about me. I'm a couple days away from my period and my anxiety is at a 10."
"I feel like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment. It's like I'm trapped inside my own head, and I can't escape the overwhelming emotions."
"My thoughts are racing a million miles a minute, and I can't seem to catch my breath. It's like my body is trying to warn me of something, but I don't know what."
"I just want to crawl into bed and disappear from the world. I feel so vulnerable and exposed, like everyone can see my inner turmoil."
"It's exhausting trying to put on a brave face when I feel like I'm falling apart inside. I just want to let it all out, but I'm afraid of what people will think."
"The pressure is building, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I'm at my breaking point, and I don't know how much longer I can hold it together."
Nothing helps to calm me down cuz I get pleasure from literally nothing. Nothing can soothe it. It's like u just gotta let it pass but it takes DAYS. Wtf is this insanity. I can't do anything.
"I'm so agitated, nothing can bring me peace.  I literally find joy in nothing. It's like there's a storm raging inside me and I have to wait for it to pass, but it takes forever."
"I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't find any solace in anything, even the things that usually make me happy. It's like I'm trapped in this state of unrest and I don't know how to escape."
"This overwhelming feeling is driving me insane. I've tried everything to calm down, but nothing works. I'm just stuck in this endless loop of anxiety."
It's like my mind is constantly on overdrive and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I'm exhausted but I can't seem to shut it off.  It's like a constant state of fight or flight.
"I feel like I'm living in a nightmare. Nothing seems real, and everything is overwhelming. I can't do anything to escape this feeling of dread."
I had a bad pmdd episode where I was super depressed around the time of my period and had my first occurrence of ROCD in my relationship... I am worried for myself and worried I won’t get better. I am worried I won’t find love. I need help asap. Feeling hopeless rn.
"I feel like I'm drowning in this depression, it's so overwhelming."
I'm terrified that I'm going to lose my mind and my relationship.
"The anxiety is crushing me, I can't even think straight."
"I'm so scared of being alone, I don't know how I'll cope."
"This feeling of hopelessness is unbearable, I just want it to end."
"Reflecting on them, striving to meet them, then recognizing how I’ve fallen short, adds a layer of guilt and shame to an already-burdensome experience when the luteal phase rolls around. I feel like I’m to blame for not cutting out the caffeine completely. For just walking instead of running. Like, I was more conscientious, but I was not *perfect*, so I deserve this."
"The guilt and shame I feel during my luteal phase is overwhelming, especially when I think about all the things I could have done differently, like completely cutting out caffeine."
"It's like I'm punishing myself for not being perfect, for not being able to stick to my goals completely, even though I was trying my best."
"Even though I know I'm doing the best I can, the luteal phase makes me feel like I'm failing, like I'm not good enough, and it's my fault."
"I just want to be able to fully enjoy my life without the constant burden of guilt and shame that comes with the luteal phase, but I feel like it's my own doing."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting against myself, trying to meet these unrealistic expectations, and when I don't, the luteal phase amplifies all the negative feelings."
"Now I feel suicidal, my vision is blurry, and I still cant put together sentences correctly. Before covid my pmdd symptoms were sucidial ideation, paranoia, hopelessness, chronically fatigued, migranes, and a bunch of other stuff."
"I'm feeling so overwhelmed and hopeless, I can't even string a sentence together."
"My head feels like it's going to explode, and I just want to curl up and disappear."
"I'm exhausted all the time, and the constant paranoia is making me feel trapped."
"I feel like I'm losing my mind, and I don't know how to get out of this dark place."
"I just want to feel normal again, but everything feels so overwhelming."
"I feel so bloated and my depression is really bad, like.. suicidal ideation bad."
"I feel so heavy and my mood is really low, it's like I'm drowning in despair."
"I'm exhausted and my anxiety is through the roof, I can barely function."
"I feel so empty and my hopelessness is overwhelming, like I'm just going through the motions."
"My body feels like lead and my self-esteem is at an all-time low, I just want to disappear."
"I feel so lost and my self-harm urges are really strong, I need help."
I wake up covered in sweat!! I literally wake up feeling like I jumped into a swimming pool fully clothed
"I had the weirdest dream last night, I was swimming in a pool with my clothes on!"
"I must have been having a nightmare, I woke up in a cold sweat and my heart was racing!"
"My sleep has been so restless lately, I'm waking up drenched in sweat and feeling exhausted."
"I think I need to invest in some new pajamas, these ones are too hot and I keep waking up feeling like I've been swimming."
"I swear I'm going to start having nightmares about swimming pools, I keep waking up feeling like I'm drowning!"
"I'm on like day 2 of my period. Sleep is wack. I think im in love but likeeeee I also don't want anyone to see this. I feel like the friend I have that also has PMDD doesn't get it/I forgot to bring it up. Im giving myself grace but I kinda wanna bury myself when I reflect on this month. Everything gets worse with PMDD. CPTSD especially. Which doesn't help that I've been struggling with some very buried childhood trauma. Regression has been coming up so fucking much. Im embarrassed asf but not bc ???? Why do I needa feel the shame? I wanna be around someone that makes me happy without doing much. wanna create everything yet nothing is satisfying. I wanna get back into some things I couldn't do while im burn out. I wanna do nothing at all. I wanna change everything about myself and nothing at all. I'm just 🥴. I'm still semi debating giving up. Im still kinda not ok with having this shit come in like a wrevking ball, I forget, then remember then guilt and shame kinda does away but I'm still embarrassed. I needa look into a full Hysterectomy bc this isn't it."
"I feel so lost and confused right now. I'm trying to be kind to myself, but I just want to hide away from the world."
This month has been a total rollercoaster. I'm struggling with my mental health and feeling overwhelmed by everything.
I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm going crazy. I just want to feel happy and at peace.
I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not in control of my own body. I wish I could just turn off my emotions.
"I'm trying to be positive, but I'm also really scared about the future. I just want to feel like I'm on the right path."
I am extremely tired for 10 to 14 days each month.
I feel exhausted for at least a week every month.
I'm constantly drained for a significant portion of each month.
My energy levels plummet for about two weeks every cycle.
I'm utterly fatigued for a solid 10 to 14 days out of the month.
"For a good chunk of each month, I'm completely wiped out."
I have been feeling incredibly empty depressed and anxious every month during the week before my period.
"I've been experiencing intense feelings of emptiness, depression, and anxiety in the week leading up to my period."
"The week before my period is always a struggle with overwhelming feelings of emptiness, sadness, and worry."
"Every month, the week before my period is marked by an unbearable sense of emptiness, depression, and anxiety."
"I feel incredibly empty, depressed, and anxious every month during the week before my period, it's a real struggle."
"The week before my period is always a time of intense emotional turmoil, I feel empty, depressed, and anxious."
"I feel stifled and depressed. When I go outside to relieve those feelings, I am overstimulated and exhausted. I am never, ever comfortable during this time. It is fucking miserable. I am lonely by myself and overwhelmed by socializing."
"I feel like I'm caught in a constant loop of feeling bad. I try to escape, but it just leads to more stress."
It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling suffocated and then feeling overloaded when I try to do anything about it.
"I'm exhausted from just trying to exist, and it's making me feel more isolated and alone."
There's no winning. I'm miserable when I'm by myself and I'm miserable when I'm around people.
This constant back-and-forth between feeling trapped and overwhelmed is completely draining.
"I thought about my lack of love life, my deep desire for human connection especially around this time, and my profound yearning for someone who I can never be with. I want to delete him. I want an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind type of event to happen to me, so I can forget all about him. I long for that connection and intimacy. I long to feel worthy of love and relationships, maybe even marriage someday. Struggling with fluctuating self esteem doesn't help either."
"I feel so lonely, especially during this time of year. I wish I could just forget about him and move on."
"My heart aches for someone to share my life with, someone who truly understands me. But it feels impossible."
"I can't help but think about him, and it makes me feel so empty inside. I just want to erase all the memories."
"I'm tired of being alone. I crave connection and intimacy, but I doubt I'll ever find it."
I'm struggling with my self-worth and it makes it hard to even imagine a future where I'm loved and happy.
"Everything is annoying me, everything is bothering me, nothing is just right."
"I'm so irritable, everything is getting on my nerves."
"Nothing seems to be going my way, everything is just aggravating."
"Everything feels off, nothing is working out how I want it to."
"I'm so frustrated, I can't stand anything right now."
"Everything is just a pain, I can't find any peace."
I get irritable - I have PTSD flashbacks during my luteal phase which makes me even more irritable.
"I'm so easily frustrated lately, and I think it's because of the hormonal shifts."
"I'm feeling really short-tempered, and I think it's related to my cycle."
"My mood has been all over the place, and I'm convinced it's because of my luteal phase."
"I'm having trouble controlling my emotions, and it's making me feel really stressed."
"I'm getting overwhelmed by the smallest things, and I think it's all tied back to my hormones."
I am selfish and gross. I hate myself.
I'm so disgusted with myself.
I feel like a terrible person.
I can't stand who I've become.
"I just want to be better, but I don't know how."
I feel like I'm a burden to everyone.
I feel like a pit that can eat anything. I start blowout fights with my boyfriend which have almost had us break up over things I’m insecure about... I feel so low about myself I just wish I was fucking dead. I drink too much when I feel this way because it helps until it doesn’t. I’m in a loop I can’t escape.
"I feel like a bottomless pit of negativity, constantly dragging everyone around me down."
"My insecurities are like a monster that I can't seem to control, and they're pushing away the only person who truly cares."
"I'm trapped in a cycle of self-destruction, fueled by alcohol and fueled by my own self-loathing."
"It's like I'm living in a dark cloud of despair, and I can't see any way out."
"I feel so broken and lost, like I'm just a shell of the person I used to be."
"I have PMDD, which also causes me pretty intense body dysmorphia"
"I've been diagnosed with PMDD, and one of the symptoms is severe body dysmorphia."
"My PMDD makes me feel really bad about my body, it's like body dysmorphia."
"The body dysmorphia I experience is really intense, and it's all because of my PMDD."
"PMDD causes a lot of mental health issues for me, one of the biggest is body dysmorphia."
"I struggle with body dysmorphia, which is a direct result of my PMDD."
I actually almost checked myself into an inpatient mental health facility the other day because my OCD and PTSD were fighting with me and winning.
My anxiety has been so bad lately that I've been seriously considering seeking professional help.
I've been struggling with my mental health for a while now and it's really starting to affect my daily life.
I feel like I'm constantly on edge and I can't seem to shake this feeling of dread.
I'm exhausted from constantly battling my inner demons and I just want to feel normal again.
It's so frustrating to feel like I'm losing control of my own mind.
"I often worry that life will never get better. I feel so heavy, don’t want to socialize, don’t want to do chores, etc. The exhaustion is suffocating. I feel like I’m always just getting by on fumes. I have no interest in being social. I don’t have any sex drive. I have zero zest for life. I just want to be alone in my own little world where I can recharge on my own terms."
I'm so tired of feeling like this.  I just want to sleep for a week straight.
"I feel like I'm constantly pushing a boulder uphill, and it never gets any lighter."
Everything feels like a chore. Even the things I used to enjoy.
My mind is just a swirling mess of anxieties and doubts.
I'm so disconnected from myself and the world around me. I feel like a ghost in my own life.
I don’t have a lot of time where my brain feels normal. I don’t trust my creative pursuits during ovulation and my lutheal phase. I only have like one week where my anxiety isn’t ruining my life.
"My brain feels like it's on fire most of the time, it's hard to focus."
"I feel like I'm constantly in a state of fight or flight, and I can't seem to relax."
"It feels like my emotions are on a rollercoaster, and I don't know how to get off."
I don't even want to try anything creative when my hormones are all over the place.
"I feel like I'm living in a fog, and I can't seem to think straight."
"I just feel like I want to jump out of my own skin. Like my skin is crawling with anger, anxiety, sadness. Rage. I feel so apathetic and down... Currently feeling slightly paranoid about people and thinking they are *trying* to get to me... Just feeling horrible, almost like when you're coming down off of drugs or something."
"I'm so overwhelmed with emotions, I just want to escape myself."
"It's like my body is filled with a fire, burning with anger, anxiety, and sadness."
I can't shake this feeling of apathy and despair.  Everything feels heavy.
"I feel like I'm on edge, constantly watching for danger, like someone is out to get me."
"This intense feeling of discomfort, like I'm coming down from a bad trip, is just unbearable."
Don’t leave your husband and buy a tiny house in the mountains
Leave your husband and go live in a cabin in the woods.
Forget about your old life and buy a small sailboat.
Just run away and start a new life on a tropical island.
Drop everything and move to a remote village.
Don't waste any more time and start living your dream.
"Mood drops, irritable, back and stomach pain. I feel like before I didnt even used to notice ovulation and now I can feel a total shift in myself."
"I'm feeling really out of sorts lately, like something's totally off balance."
"I'm so moody and irritable, it's like I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions."
It's almost like I'm experiencing a whole new level of awareness of my body.
"My body feels totally different, like it's going through some kind of transformation."
"I used to be oblivious to the changes happening inside me, but now I feel everything."
"I'm so tired. Feel like I'm constantly in a state of PMDD. I had my third injection around one month ago and this get awful like end it all awful. I'm now on estrogen gel and micronised proestrogene and feel awful as well, anxious, irritable, tired and tearful all the time."
"I feel like my body is constantly betraying me, and it's making me feel so hopeless."
"The side effects are so intense, I can barely function. It's like my body is waging war on itself."
I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. I just want to feel normal again.
It's a constant battle against my hormones and emotions. I feel like I'm losing control.
This whole experience is making me feel so isolated and alone. I wish someone understood what I'm going through.
"I wake up and my stomach is turningggg. I feel like I have the slight urge to pass out or throw up. I have brain fog and anxiety, and I also get acid reflux."
"I'm feeling so nauseous and dizzy, it's like my body is rebelling against itself."
"My head feels fuzzy and my stomach is doing flips, I just want to lie down."
"I have this weird feeling of nausea and anxiety, and I can't seem to shake it."
"My stomach is churning and I feel like I might faint, I'm definitely not feeling my best."
"I'm having a rough morning, my stomach is acting up and I feel like I'm going to be sick."
I CANT STOP CRYINGGGGGGGG I CANT ATOP CRYING IM ACTUALLY GOING TO FUCKING LOSE MY MIND IM INSANEEEE IM INSANE IM INSANE IM INSANE
"I'm so overwhelmed with sadness, I can't seem to stop crying."
"My emotions are completely out of control, I feel like I'm going to lose it."
"This is too much for me to handle, I'm breaking down."
"I'm feeling so incredibly sad and hopeless, I just want it to stop."
"I can't cope with all of this, I'm losing my mind."
"I get seriously angry and moody... When I get the cramps I just feel cursed, I wanna kill everyone and I get soo moody."
I feel like a completely different person when I'm on my period.
It's like my body is possessed by a demon during my period.
"I can't even think straight when I'm cramping, I just want to crawl into a hole and disappear."
"My mood swings are so extreme during my period, I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster."
"I don't know why I get so angry and irritable during my period, it's like a switch flips."
"Hi, I’m an artist and PMDD has made me extremely miserable for many years."
"I've been struggling with PMDD for a long time, and it's really been taking a toll on my mental health."
My life has been consumed by the debilitating symptoms of PMDD for years now.
"I'm an artist, but PMDD has made it almost impossible for me to create and enjoy life."
The constant ups and downs of PMDD have made me feel like a completely different person.
"I've been to countless doctors and tried every treatment imaginable, but PMDD still controls my life."
I'm on the 14 day PMDD plan
I'm trying out the 14-day PMDD plan to see if it helps.
My doctor put me on a 14-day PMDD plan to manage my symptoms.
"This is my second week on the 14-day PMDD plan, and I'm already seeing some improvements."
I'm hoping this 14-day PMDD plan will provide some relief from my symptoms.
"The 14-day PMDD plan is a lot to handle, but I'm determined to see it through."
I was struggling with my thoughts and mood the past week and it got really bad this morning. Then an hour after my episode I started to bleed and my mood started to come up again. It’s so abrupt and weird how fast my mood switches up like that
"My mental health has been up and down lately, and this morning was a low point. Then, out of nowhere, I started bleeding, and strangely enough, my mood started to improve."
"The past week has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me. This morning I hit a real low, but then something unexpected happened and my mood began to lift."
"I've been feeling really down and overwhelmed lately. This morning was particularly bad, but then something physical happened that strangely made me feel better."
"It's been a difficult week for me mentally, and this morning things really went downhill. But then, an hour later, something happened that seemed to shift my mood completely."
"I've been battling with my emotions and it felt like I was in a dark place this morning. Then, something completely unexpected happened and it was like a switch flipped in my head."
I get symptoms for over a week.
I've been feeling under the weather for more than a week now.
These symptoms have been bothering me for over seven days.
I've been experiencing these symptoms for the past week and a bit.
This illness has lasted for over a week.
I've been feeling this way for more than seven days.
Recently I've been wondering if that's linked to a irregular/ missed ovulation... my latest cycle was 50 days and i really had no physical symptoms that anything was coming.
"I've been having longer cycles lately, and I'm wondering if I might be ovulating irregularly."
"My last cycle was so long, I'm not sure if I ovulated at all."
I'm concerned about my irregular cycles - my last one was 50 days long!
"I haven't had any of my usual pre-period symptoms this month, and my cycle was way longer than normal."
"I'm wondering if my recent long cycle could be a sign of something else, like a missed ovulation."
the added stress I know would do a number on me
I know that extra pressure would really take its toll on me.
I can feel that the extra stress would really wear me down.
I'm sure the added stress would be really bad for me.
I know that additional pressure would really put a strain on me.
I'm certain that the added stress would really have a negative impact on me.
I feel restless
I can't seem to sit still.
I'm feeling antsy and agitated.
I have this urge to move around.
I'm not able to relax or settle down.
I just need to get out and do something.
I feel like the effects linger... Like it takes me a while to get myself out of the hole. I keep looking into it but everything I’ve read just says that it may not be PMDD related but do we actually know??? ... I’m just tired of dealing with this and not knowing when or how or how hard it’s gonna hit me.
"I'm constantly trying to understand what's happening, but it feels like I'm just stuck in this cycle of uncertainty."
"It's exhausting trying to figure it out, especially when it feels like I'm just going in circles."
"I wish I had some answers, but it seems like everything I find just raises more questions."
It's frustrating not knowing how severe it will be or when it will hit me again.
"I just want to be able to predict it, to have some sense of control over it."
Last month I caused a car accident. This month I became paranoid and thought my new friend was trying to poison and rob me. I'm worried something really bad will happen soon.
"I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop."
My anxiety is through the roof. I can't shake the feeling that something terrible is going to happen.
I'm so scared of making another mistake that I'm practically paralyzed with fear.
"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I feel like I'm going crazy."
"I'm having trouble sleeping, and I can't seem to focus on anything else but my fears."
I've been crying non-stop all day with deep waves of painful sadness in my chest... I am simply feeling this way. My chest physically hurts from the sadness. I don't want to eat. I don't want to talk to anyone. I am trying to manage my feelings and keep business as usual but it doesn't matter what I do the feeling doesn't leave.
"I'm overwhelmed with sorrow, it feels like a physical weight on my chest. I can't even bring myself to eat or talk to anyone."
"The sadness is so intense, it's like a constant ache in my chest. I just want to hide away and let the tears flow."
"I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of despair, and no matter how hard I try to swim, I just keep sinking."
"I'm trying to stay strong and act normal, but the sadness keeps pulling me down. It's like a dark cloud that won't go away."
"This sadness feels unbearable, it's like a physical wound that won't stop bleeding. I just want to feel something else, anything else."
non stop crying hate everyone cant do anything. sweating like im 802837472 pounds. i’m truly going insane.
"I'm so overwhelmed with sadness, I can't even function. It feels like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders."
Everything feels hopeless. I'm drowning in despair and I can't seem to find my way out.
I'm at my breaking point. I can't handle this anymore. I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I just want to scream. I just want to disappear. I feel so lost and alone.
This pain is unbearable. I feel like I'm crumbling from the inside out.
I'M SO FUCKING PISSED AND SO FUCKING HURT AND SO FUCKING STRESSED AND SO FUCKING POOR AND MY BOYFRIEND FUCKING HATES ME AND I FUCKING HATE HIM AND IM SO FUCKING FAT AND I FUCKING AM FUCKING CRAZY
"I'm so angry and hurt, everything is going wrong and I feel like I'm falling apart."
"I'm drowning in stress, I'm broke, my relationship is a mess and I hate myself."
I feel like I'm constantly letting everyone down and I can't handle it anymore.
"I feel overwhelmed and hopeless, I just want to disappear."
"I'm so tired of feeling this way, I just want to be happy again."
Today my brain is all over the place. I can't seem to calm down. ... I get a burst of energy that somehow convinces me that I can flip my life around.
"I'm so scattered today, it's like my brain is bouncing around in my head."
My thoughts are racing and I can't seem to focus on anything.
"I feel like I'm all over the map today, one minute I'm excited, the next I'm overwhelmed."
"I'm so restless, I can't sit still for more than a few minutes."
"I keep getting these bursts of energy that make me think I can accomplish anything, but then I crash and burn."
"sick of having to explain myself all the time , just want to be alone , miserable as is"
"I'm tired of justifying my actions, I just need some space to be alone."
"It's exhausting constantly defending myself, I just want to be left alone."
"I'm done explaining myself to everyone, I just want to be alone and miserable."
"I'm so sick of having to explain my reasons, I just want to be by myself."

"I have a complete negative thought spiral and very low self esteem which really affects my ability to perform “adult” stuff...Currently I’m on my period and I can’t even call and schedule a hair appointment because all I can think about is a bad outcome, that my hair will be ruined etc."
I'm so paralyzed by anxiety that I can't even make simple appointments. I imagine all the things that could go wrong and it feels like my brain is stuck on a negative loop.
"I feel like I'm trapped in a downward spiral of negative thoughts and low self-esteem, it makes even the simplest tasks feel impossible."
My self-doubt is so intense right now that it's affecting my ability to function. I can't even call for a basic appointment without overthinking everything.
I'm constantly anticipating the worst and it makes me feel so helpless. It's like my mind is sabotaging me before I even get started.
I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of fear and anxiety. It's hard to get anything done when all I can think about is how things might go wrong.
Last night I just got so angry and paranoid about my relationship and kind of snapped. I apologized immediately after and then started crying
I was feeling really insecure about my relationship last night and ended up saying some things I didn't mean. I felt terrible about it and apologized right away.
My anxiety got the best of me last night and I overreacted about my relationship. I instantly regretted it and started crying.

I was so consumed by my fears about our relationship last night that I snapped at my partner. I was immediately filled with guilt and started crying because I knew I was wrong.

"Yesterday was awful. I woke up angry and upset for no apparent reason. Pissed off at everyone around me. I didn't eat despite feeling hungry because during these 'moods' I often feel like punishing myself by starving. ...By evening it felt like a fog had descended and everything was muffled, and I became completely unresponsive. ...I just felt so lonely and sad that the only thing that seemed to bring some relief was picturing my death."

"Today was just a hard day for me. A random $900 charge from my landlord sent me completely spiraling it seems like and just the despair and rage I felt was unmatched. I’ve been just sobbing all day and had to call out of work bc I can’t function. It feels hopeless bc I’m thinking if even the strongest antidepressants on the market can’t help me, what will?"
I feel completely overwhelmed and defeated today. Everything just feels hopeless and I don't know how to cope.
It feels like the world is against me today. Everything is falling apart and I don't know how to fix it.
This unexpected expense has completely thrown me off my game. I feel like I'm drowning in stress and anxiety.

"I just want to crawl into bed and disappear. I'm so exhausted from fighting these feelings, but it feels like there's no escape."
my PMDD makes me actively suicidal every month. I’ve been sectioned because of it and also am basically on suicide watch at home. My anxiety gets worse (it’s already severe) to the point where I can’t function. All my hope goes. My past haunts me. It’s getting harder and harder to resist my thoughts.
"PMDD is a horrible condition, I feel like I lose myself every month."

We have uteruses too and we can also have crippling PMDD. I was on this reddit looking to see if anyone had had any positive experiences going on T and that helping their PMDD
We are not just bodies; we have complex hormonal cycles that can significantly impact our health and wellbeing.
"It's important to acknowledge that women's health issues, like PMDD, are real and can be debilitating."
I'm looking for information and support from others who have experienced similar challenges.
I'm hopeful that there might be solutions or treatments that can help manage PMDD.
It's frustrating that there's so little understanding and support for women's hormonal health issues.

My cravings are so bad and last for 2-3 days a month. I always know because all of a sudden my only purpose in life is to consume anything cold and fruity. It ruins my mood if I can’t have it. Berry smoothies and sherbets are my main ones. It’s all I can think about.
"I can't concentrate on anything else when this craving hits, all I want is to eat something cold and fruity."
It's like a switch flips and all I care about is finding something cold and fruity to eat.
"These cravings are so intense, I feel like I can't function until I satisfy them."
"I get these intense cravings for cold, fruity things that last for a couple of days every month."

immediately went from happy and content to feeling like jumping out of my fucking skin
I went from feeling great to feeling like I was going to explode.
My mood went from fantastic to completely unbearable in a flash.
I couldn't believe how quickly my joy turned into pure agony.
"One minute I was relaxed, the next I was ready to tear my hair out."
That sudden shift in emotion was like a switch flipped from happiness to sheer panic.
"My coworker cracks his knuckles (every single one) at least 20 times I day, I am not kidding. It’s disgusting and makes me want to crawl out of my own skin."
My coworker's constant tapping on his keyboard drives me absolutely bonkers.
The way she chews gum with her mouth open is seriously the worst.
His incessant humming is the background noise of my nightmares.
I'm pretty sure the guy next to me is doing his taxes by whistling - I can't focus!
My boss's phone calls are like a symphony of awkward coughs and throat clearing - it's so distracting.
I was starting to hate myself because of how annoyed I would get at other people just existing.
I felt like I was becoming a terrible person because I was constantly irritated by others.
I was starting to think there was something wrong with me because I couldn't stand people just being themselves.
My own annoyance at others was making me dislike myself.
I was disgusted with myself for getting so angry at people for doing the most ordinary things.
The way I was reacting to people was making me feel ashamed of myself.
I get into one of those moods
I'm feeling a little down.
I just don't feel like myself today.
I'm not really in the mood for anything.
I feel kind of blah.
I'm in one of my grumpy moods.

"The constant throat clearing was distracting, breaking the flow of the conversation."
"He couldn't help but notice the incessant throat clearing, a sign of nervousness perhaps."

I'm going to lose my mind if I hear that kid's whistle one more time.

I can't believe how inconsiderate my neighbour is letting their kid make so much noise.
"I'm at my wit's end with the noise from my neighbour's kid, I'm about to go crazy."
I hate wearing anything in/on my ears all day. When I'm this sensitive I often try to go home early
I can't stand having things in my ears for hours on end.

I'd rather be home than stuck here with this discomfort.
"I really hate it when my ears get irritated like this, it makes me want to leave."
Everything is wet and heavy. Youre wasting time trying!
"It's pointless to keep going, everything is soaked and weighs a ton."

"Give it up, you're just wasting time. Everything is soaked and it's all too heavy to do anything."
Why are you trying?  Everything is sopping wet and impossible to move.

I don’t think I can EVER go back to working like this
I can't imagine going back to working like this ever again.
"Working like this is just unsustainable, I can't do it anymore."
There's no way I'm going back to working this way.
"I'm done working like this, I need a change."
"This is just not how I want to be working, I need to find a better way."
"a drop in mood and motivation, negative spirals etc."
"Bir anda enerji düşüklüğü ve isteksizlik hissetmek, olumsuz düşüncelerin peş peşe gelmesi gibi..."
"Moralimin ve motivasyonumun düşmesi, her şeyin kötüye gittiği hissiyatı gibi..."
"Aniden keyfimin kaçması, hiçbir şey yapmak istememem, olumsuz bir döngüye girmiş gibi hissetmem..."
"Motivasyonumun azalması, içimde olumsuz bir enerji hissetmem ve bu durumun devam etmesi gibi..."

I am afraid of working my way up and getting a better paying position at my company because what if I can't do the job while I am tired during my 2 weeks of fatigue? What if I make too many mistakes? 
I'm worried about getting promoted because I'm afraid of failing when I'm exhausted and making mistakes.
What if I get a raise and then can't handle the pressure and responsibilities?

The thought of a promotion scares me because I don't want to disappoint my boss or colleagues.
I'm hesitant about moving up because I'm afraid of failing to meet the higher expectations.
"I've seen so, so many stories from people going through chemical menopause who say that it gets (a lot) worse before it gets better and/or that they had PMDD symptoms every day for months after their first shot, and I just...don't think I could handle that. But at the same time, I can barely handle going through this every month. Knowing that it could happen once a month for the next 20+ years is depressing."
"I understand that chemical menopause can be really tough, but I'm worried about how long it could last and the intensity of the symptoms."
"It's hard to imagine going through the worst of PMDD every single day for months, especially after already experiencing its effects."
"The idea of having to deal with this kind of discomfort for decades is just overwhelming, even though I know it could be a temporary solution."

"I'm not sure if I could handle the potential side effects, even if it means getting some relief from my current symptoms."
"Woke up to a panic attack a few days ago...tonight I felt a weird sensation in my throat and the panic hit. My health anxiety gets so bad during the pmdd, one little thing that feels or tastes different can set off my body's alarm."

My health anxiety is so intense during PMDD that even the tiniest things can feel like a huge threat.
"I wish I could just switch off my anxiety, but it feels like my body is determined to keep me in a constant state of panic."
I feel like a goddamn werewolf
I'm feeling like a monster.
I feel so out of control.
I'm completely losing it.
It's like I'm going crazy.
I'm at my breaking point.
"When PMDD symptoms flare up, I feel like I'm not myself, which I find really distressing. It's painful to be disliked or become the reason for a breakup because of something I didn't choose to have."
"The emotional rollercoaster during PMDD makes me feel like a stranger to myself, and that's a truly unsettling experience."
"It's heartbreaking to be judged or blamed for things beyond my control, especially when it's related to something as personal and difficult as PMDD."
"I wish people understood that PMDD is not a choice, and that my actions during flare-ups are not a reflection of my true self."
It's hard enough to cope with PMDD symptoms without having to deal with the added burden of misunderstandings and judgment from others.
"The feeling of being rejected or abandoned due to PMDD is a heavy weight to carry, especially when it's something I can't simply switch off."

"I rarely cry, I get angry instead of sad in most situations. Nothing has even happened I just can’t stop crying. My nose is so blocked I’m having to manually breathe through my mouth, I can’t think of anything that would comfort me right now. Usually I just get depressed, and I go numb for about a week before I bleed. But right now I’ve got hot streams of tears."
"I'm usually the one who stays strong, but this time it's different. I just can't hold it back, it's like a dam breaking."

She longs for a life free from the constant fear and self-doubt that plague her every interaction.
"She desperately seeks validation and acceptance, hoping to find solace in a world that often feels indifferent to her struggles."
"I am very bloated, I've gained weight recently and it makes me look huge and affects my confidence and social anxiety."
"I feel so puffy and uncomfortable, I've put on some pounds lately and it makes me feel self-conscious and anxious about going out."

I'm really struggling with my body image right now. I've gained some weight and it's making me feel bigger than I am and I'm just not feeling confident about myself.
"I wake up feel horrible, weak, tired. ... I have No friends, no job, no motivation for anything, bills to pay & no money. ... I feel good for maybe 3-5 days out of the month and back to being a miserable person. ... Now i just feel miserable, empty, and completely lost in life. Im sick of the pain and mental effect this has on me."
"I'm just existing, not really living. It's like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of feeling down and hopeless."
"I used to think things would get better, but now I'm just numb to it all. It feels like I'm losing myself."
"I'm drowning in debt, and I'm too tired to even try to swim. I just feel like giving up."
"There's a part of me that's still hopeful, but it's getting harder to hold onto that feeling every day."
"I wish I had someone to talk to, someone who could understand what I'm going through."
"i have the hardest time fighting the urge to self harm and relapse... i have suicidal thoughts which get extremely bad to the point i almost found a dealer for heroin, to try and overdose with enough heroin. these thoughts get really bad at this time and even though i know its likely because its PMDD, i have a hard time ignoring them."
"I feel so overwhelmed by these suicidal thoughts that I can barely function, let alone think rationally."
"The urge to self-harm is so strong right now, I'm scared I'm going to give in."
"I know this is probably just the PMDD talking, but it feels so real, so urgent, that I'm terrified."
"It feels like I'm drowning in these dark thoughts, and I don't know how to swim out."
"I just want the pain to stop, even if it means ending it all."

It's so frustrating that I'm trapped in this cycle of intense emotions and I just want to disappear.
I'm so exhausted by this constant fight against my own body and mind.
"The world feels too big and too chaotic right now, and I just want to curl up in bed and disappear."
"I know I should be happy about the cancelled flights, but all I can think about is how much this is going to affect my work."
"I find one of the worst fucking parts of PMDD is intrusive thoughts. Being more sensitive. Everything being fucking uncomfortable and then add in having to be soooo fucking... intentional but graceful with my thoughts  & actions.. Like constant battle of ""should I allow myself to focus on this/give it space vs do I needa distract rn?"" "
The most frustrating aspect of PMDD is the constant battle against intrusive thoughts.
"It's so hard to manage the heightened sensitivity and discomfort that comes with PMDD, especially when you have to be mindful of your words and actions."
Being forced to choose between giving space to my feelings and distracting myself is a daily struggle during PMDD.
The constant need to be intentional and graceful in my thoughts and actions during PMDD feels like an endless battle.
"I hate the way PMDD makes me feel so uncomfortable and sensitive, and then I have to fight with myself to be thoughtful and controlled."

"I have bad side effects with SSRI that caused me to stop it. My preexisting PMDD symptoms have worsened (tearfulness, emotional regulation, SI. My PMDD symptoms are already quite bad right now, I'm thinking 'Well, how much worse can it be, even with BC?'"
I'm worried that the side effects of this medication will make my pre-existing PMDD symptoms unbearable.
"I'm considering going off this medication entirely, but I'm worried about how much worse my PMDD symptoms will become."
I'm not sure if I can handle the side effects of this medication along with my PMDD symptoms.
"It feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the medication causing side effects and my PMDD symptoms already being difficult to manage."
"I'm really struggling with this medication and my PMDD symptoms, it feels like I'm caught in a vicious cycle."

I am really coming to terms with the fact that my increased liability to complain and become more generally disagreeable during luteal is a major pain point for my partner

"I'm trying to find ways to manage my irritability during my luteal phase, because it's really affecting my relationship."
"I feel bad that I become more difficult to deal with during my luteal phase, but I can't seem to help it."

"I lose all of my patience and I'm so easy to say 'Fuck it! I don't give a fuck anymore', then immediately regret it once the dust settles. I hate myself today. I hate PMDD. I hate the impact that it has on our lives."
"I feel like I'm constantly on edge, and it takes so little to make me snap. I just want to throw my hands up and say 'I can't deal with this anymore,' but then I feel terrible about it later."
"It's like I'm not even myself during these times.  I say things I don't mean, and then I'm left feeling ashamed and guilty."
"I know it's not my fault, but it feels like PMDD is taking over my life.  It's impacting my relationships, my work, and even my ability to enjoy myself."
"The anger and frustration just build up inside me until I explode.  It's like a volcano erupting, and then I'm left with the aftermath to clean up."
I'm tired of feeling like this.  I'm tired of the constant rollercoaster of emotions.  I just want to feel normal again.
"I've been dealing with pmdd since my youngest son was born in 2003... I've been battling with major depression, even during the 'normal' days."
"I've been struggling with this condition for years, even before my youngest son was born."
"It feels like I'm constantly battling something, even when I should be feeling okay."
"The depression is so intense, it makes it hard to even function on good days."
"I've tried everything to find relief, but nothing seems to work."
It's a constant struggle to just get through the day.
"I started supplementing to avoid PMDD until my period came... I have all the pre-warning signs and I just _know_ I'm about to menstruate, but..."
"I felt the symptoms coming on, and I knew it was going to be a rough week."
"The fatigue, the mood swings, the cravings – I was dreading the next few days."
"My body was sending me all the signals, and I knew it was about to start."
"I could feel it coming on, the familiar feelings of premenstrual distress."
"I tried everything to avoid the symptoms, but it was inevitable."
I feel like I eat everything in sight and I would like to try and maintain my weight. I've gained 10 pounds since March.
I've been eating a lot lately and I want to start eating healthier.
"I'm trying to control my weight, but I've been indulging a lot."
"I need to get back on track with my diet, I've put on some weight."
"I'm trying to be mindful of what I eat, I've gained some weight recently."
"I need to make healthier choices, I've gained 10 pounds in the past few months."
I have had 2 mental breakdowns where I've hyperventilated on the bathroom floor. I have CPTSD and ADHD so I have bad social anxiety and a massive fear of being out of control. So my stress levels have been elevated 24/7 for almost 3 weeks.
My anxiety has been so bad lately that I've had two panic attacks where I couldn't breathe and ended up on the bathroom floor.
"The combination of CPTSD and ADHD makes me feel like I'm constantly on edge, and I've been having a lot of trouble managing my anxiety."
"It's been really hard to cope with the constant stress and fear, and it feels like I'm always on the verge of a breakdown."
"I'm so afraid of losing control that I've been hyperventilating and having panic attacks, which makes it even harder to function."
"The constant stress is taking a toll on my mental health, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my grip on reality."
"I felt a mix of content and anxiety. The first week mentally, was much different than I imagined it would be...those first few days, I was just very up and down with my emotions. At night, I would get these intense moments of panic...The night sweats were also INTENSE...I would just absolutely lose my mind over things that didn’t warrant it. I remember wondering why TF I did this and telling my husband I was stopping the HRT..."
I was caught between feeling happy and scared.
"The initial phase was a rollercoaster of emotions, far from what I expected."
Those early days were marked by extreme ups and downs.
The panic attacks at night were overwhelming.
"I was completely irrational, reacting to things that didn't deserve such a strong response."
"My thoughts are all over the place, darting back and forth between “you have to get up you can’t let this control you” to “I have no strength left, I don’t care about anything, I hate everyone, I don’t wanna be here anymore.” I end up completely isolating myself and shutting down."
I feel like I'm stuck in this constant battle between fighting for what I want and just giving up completely.
It's exhausting trying to keep pushing myself forward when all I want to do is curl up and disappear.
"I know I should be doing something, but all my energy is drained, and I just can't seem to muster any motivation."
"This feeling of being overwhelmed and hopeless is really taking a toll on me, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing myself."
"I feel like I'm caught in this cycle of trying to regain control, only to be pulled back down into this dark, empty place."
I get inconsolably sad and so enraged that I have broken things. I ripped my cars' rear view mirror off because I forgot my credit card and walmart does not have tap to pay so everyone thinks I'm dumb now.
"I get so frustrated when I forget things, like the other day I lost my keys and ended up having to kick in the door."
"My temper gets the best of me sometimes, like when I spilled coffee on my new laptop and just wanted to throw it across the room."
"I get so embarrassed when I make mistakes, like that time I accidentally called my boss by the wrong name in front of everyone."
"I hate it when things don't go my way, like when I missed my flight because I forgot to check in online."
"It drives me crazy when I can't find something, like the other day I spent an hour looking for my phone and it was in my pocket the whole time."
"I question if I am... I hate this, it's really affecting my mental health. I've considered myself bi since I was 12 and having to question it every 3-4 weeks is hell. I feel only 100% definitely bisexual like after my period finishes."
"I'm so tired of constantly questioning my sexuality, it's making me anxious and stressed."
"I feel like I'm constantly going back and forth on my sexuality, and it's really taking a toll on me."
"I know I'm bi, but I can't help but doubt myself sometimes, and it's making me feel terrible."
"It's like my sexuality changes every few weeks, and it's driving me crazy."
"I wish I could just be confident in my sexuality, but it's so hard when I'm constantly questioning myself."
"I legit had a panic attack and meltdown on the way up the mountain - could not get my heart rate down, was careening very close to a depressive spiral, ugly tears and snot streaming down my face, muttering curse words to the birds and trees around me - the whole shebang. This is ""par for the course"" hell week symptoms for me - doing all this while hiking a mountain? When I'm supposed to be having the time of my life? Not so much. I was in physical, mental, and emotional hell, trapped in my hormonally sensitive body."
"I felt like I was completely losing it, my body and mind were both in a state of complete chaos."
"It was like my whole world was crashing down on me, and I couldn't see a way out."
"I was so overwhelmed with stress and anxiety, it felt like I was going to explode."
"I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear, but I knew I had to keep going."
"My emotions were all over the place, and I couldn't seem to catch my breath."
he's so fucking emotionally unavailable and shut off... when we have issues in the relationship I always have to pry him open and play guessing games as to what's wrong because he is completely incapable of sharing his feelings... Also he has an aversion to sex and touch.
"He's so distant and closed off emotionally, it's like talking to a brick wall."
"I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him, afraid to say the wrong thing."
"He doesn't want to talk about his feelings, and he definitely doesn't want to talk about ours."
"It's exhausting trying to figure out what's going on in his head, it's like he's a complete mystery."
It's like he's built a wall around his heart and refuses to let anyone in.
"I was just diagnosed. I am working on quitting weed (recreational on weekends) and alcohol. Keeping coffee to a minimum, probably going to go Decaf over luteal phase. I take Wellbutrin 300 every day for ADHD. Starting Lexapro 10 during luteal phase."
I'm trying to be healthier and manage my mental health better.
I'm making some changes to my lifestyle to feel better overall.
I'm focusing on my well-being and seeking professional help for my ADHD.
I'm taking steps to improve my mental and physical health through medication and lifestyle changes.
I'm going through a period of adjustment as I try to manage my mental health and substance use.
"I feel like everyone hates me and I can’t keep up with everything I need to do. I feel exhausted but so anxious at the same time. I just feel isolated, like I’m a burden and that no one loves me. I feel like I have no friends and everyone at work hates me."
I feel so lonely and misunderstood. It feels like I’m constantly failing and letting everyone down.
"I just want to disappear. Everything is so overwhelming, and I feel like I’m drowning."
I’m so tired of feeling like a failure. I just want to be happy and loved.
"I feel like a complete mess. I’m struggling to keep it together, and I’m scared of what will happen if I don’t."
I’m so lost and alone. I feel like I’m constantly fighting a losing battle.
"sweat its running off. Hair now frizz, make up almost down face"
"I'm sweating so much, it's running down my face. My hair's frizzy and my makeup is almost completely gone."
"I'm a hot mess! Sweat is dripping, my hair's a frizzy mess, and my makeup is practically gone."
"This heat is intense! I'm dripping sweat, my hair's all frizzy, and my makeup is melting off."
"Ugh, I'm sweating like crazy. My hair is turning into a frizzy mess, and my makeup is practically disappearing."
"I'm feeling the heat! I'm sweating buckets, my hair's getting frizzy, and my makeup is starting to look bad."
I've had a bad day today and have just been sobbing down the phone to my mum... Apparently I have a specific cry that I only do when I'm pre menstrual?!
"I've been feeling really down lately and I've been feeling a bit emotional, it's like I can't even think straight."
"I've been feeling so overwhelmed and stressed, and I just need to vent to someone."
"I've been feeling really sensitive and emotional, and I'm not sure why."
I've been feeling so anxious and I can't seem to shake it.
"I'm so tired of feeling this way, I just want to feel normal again."
I have a sharp chest pain on the right side.
I'm experiencing a sharp pain in my right chest.
My chest is hurting really badly on the right side.
There's a stabbing pain in my chest on the right.
I feel a very intense pain in my right chest area.
The pain in my chest is very concentrated on the right.
I'm a miserable mess. I don't even know myself or explain it myself. I can't tell him what I need because I also don't know what I need!
"I'm lost and confused, I can't even put my feelings into words."
"I'm a jumbled mess, I feel like a stranger to myself."
I'm so lost in my own thoughts and emotions that I can't even articulate them.
"I feel like I'm drowning in my own problems, I can't even figure out how to help myself."
"I'm completely overwhelmed, I need help but I don't even know what I need."
All I wanted to do yesterday was cry and sleep. I had a couple of work appts and something scheduled for my son. I pushed through yesterday to accomplish everything
Yesterday was a really tough day and all I wanted to do was sleep and cry.
I was so exhausted yesterday that all I wanted to do was cry and sleep.
I had a really long day yesterday and all I wanted to do was cry and sleep. 
I had a stressful day yesterday and all I wanted to do was cry and sleep.
I had so much going on yesterday that I just wanted to cry and sleep.
"It's hard to do things in general, I feel lost."
I feel like I'm constantly struggling to get things done.
It feels like there's always something getting in my way.
I just feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do next.
"Everything seems impossible, I don't even know where to begin."
"I'm just lost and confused, I don't know how to make any progress."
"I'm constantly plagued with intrusive thoughts of inadequacy and worthlessness and ideation, and cannot motivate myself to do anything productive."
"I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm constantly failing, which makes it impossible to do anything that matters."
I'm trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts that leave me paralyzed and unable to function.
"My mind is filled with self-doubt and a feeling of being worthless, making it impossible to find the energy to do anything."
"I'm constantly battling with these intrusive thoughts that tell me I'm a failure, and it's exhausting trying to fight them."
"I can't seem to escape the feeling that I'm not good enough and that everything I do is pointless, which makes it impossible to find the motivation to do anything."
I feel like I have zero friends and my family is no help... I felt very sad cuz now I have no plans... I’ve been in bed for the past 3 days in and out of sleep. I’m a nurse so I kinda know I’m messing up but I just feel so tired and weak. Ill haven’t eaten or really drank anything in 3 days but I can’t find the energy to do it.
"I'm completely isolated and exhausted, my body feels like it's shutting down."
"I just want to crawl under the covers and disappear, I have no motivation to do anything."
"I feel so alone and helpless, I just want someone to understand."
"I'm struggling to even take care of myself, I feel like I'm falling apart."
"I'm so overwhelmed with sadness and fatigue, it's hard to even think straight."
"I still have my own struggles, but my now fiancee helps me navigate them."
"I'm still working through my own issues, but my fiancee is incredibly supportive."
"There are still things I struggle with, but having my fiancee by my side makes it easier."
"I still have my own challenges, but my fiancee helps me deal with them in a healthy way."
"My fiancee is a huge help in navigating the tough times, even though I still face my own obstacles."
"I still have my share of challenges, but my fiancee is there to help me face them and work through them."
"I would be like “maybe now I’ll be symptom free” and then no, I wouldn’t be. I actually had a full crying breakdown one month because I’m like - why the FUCK am I working THIS HARD for the most …minuscule results? I don’t eat sugar so I can fucking, what? Have a slightly less ginormous painful period or only get to 5% of a desire to drive a car off the bridge at 200km ph?"
"I felt like I was doing everything right, but the progress was so slow and minimal."
"It felt like I was putting in so much effort, but the results were so small and insignificant."
I was putting in all this effort for absolutely nothing.
I was exhausted and frustrated by the lack of progress.
"It felt like I was working so hard, but it wasn't making any difference."
"I didn’t want to be alive anymore. I then felt so numb - it’s a feeling I cannot explain but I just feel like I did not have the strength to do this anymore. I’m tired of suffering and struggling. Tired of feeling so ugly and alone. Tired of not having enough money. Tired of feeling like there is no hope for my future. Tired of the fact that no matter how hard I try, I still cannot get ahead in life. Dealing with PMDD and extremely heavy periods each month is just the cherry on top of the cake."
I'm at my breaking point. I feel like I'm drowning in despair and I just can't keep swimming.
"I'm exhausted from fighting this constant battle. I feel like I'm losing, and I don't know how much more I can take."
"My spirit is crushed. I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and it's crushing me."
"I'm desperate for a way out. I just want the pain to stop, but I can't see a way to make it happen."
"I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not enough. I feel like a failure, and I don't know how to change that."
"I cannot handle this forever. I’m dying. This makes my life so unlivable. Constantly angry, sad, tired or just in pain… It actually feels like my uterus has a neck and someone is strangling it."
I'm at my breaking point. I can't keep going like this.
This is unbearable. I feel like I'm drowning.
"It's like a constant, nagging pain that never goes away."
I'm exhausted. Every day is a struggle.
I'm losing myself. I don't know who I am anymore.
"I have no ADHD meds to be found. I know how to treat my OCD, but I’m too exhausted and fatigued to do any exposure. I tend to feel like I’m sick from my luteal phase through when I menstruate. It’s awful."
"I'm so drained, I can't even muster the energy to do my usual self-care routines."
"The exhaustion is so bad that I can barely function, let alone focus on my mental health."
"I'm completely wiped out, and the last thing I want to do is anything that requires effort."
I'm just so exhausted that I can't even bring myself to do the things that normally help me.
The fatigue is so overwhelming that I feel like I'm barely holding it together.
"sitting here with a nervous knot in my stomach about what I need to get done before I leave, how bad I’ll miss my babies, and don’t forget to eat"
"I'm feeling anxious about everything I need to accomplish before I go, and I'm going to miss my children terribly.  Oh, and I need to remember to eat."
"My stomach is in knots thinking about all the things on my to-do list before I leave, the fact that I'm going to miss my kids so much, and  don't forget to eat!"
"I'm a nervous wreck about getting everything done before I go, and I know I'm going to miss my babies like crazy, but I also need to remember to eat."
"My mind is racing with all the things I have to do before I leave, and the thought of being away from my children is heartbreaking, but I can't forget to eat!"
"I'm a bundle of nerves about what I need to do before I leave, I'm going to miss my babies terribly, and I have to remember to eat."
I just had an amazing two weeks of feeling great and then suddenly im ovulating and the torture starts again
"The last two weeks have been fantastic, but now the monthly torture is back."
"I was feeling so good for two weeks, but now the ovulation symptoms have kicked in and I'm miserable again."
"I've been on a high for the past two weeks, but it seems like my body is determined to remind me that it's still on a cycle."
"Two weeks of feeling amazing, and then boom, ovulation hits and the pain starts all over again."
"It's like a cruel joke. I had two great weeks, and now my body is making me pay for it."
"Ive had some very bad PMDD and have been going through some of the worst symptoms. Irritability, depression, stress, the works."
"I've been having a really tough time with PMDD lately, the symptoms have been unbearable."
"The irritability, depression, and stress from PMDD have been taking a toll on me."
"These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult with PMDD, I've been struggling with the symptoms."
"PMDD has been really hard on me recently, I've been experiencing severe irritability, depression, and stress."
"The symptoms of PMDD have been so intense lately, it's been a real struggle to cope."
"If the mountain seems too big today, then climb the hill instead. If the morning brings you softness, it’s OK to stay in bed. If a shower stings like needles, and a bath feels like you’ve drowned, If you haven’t washed your hair in days, don’t throw away your crown. It’s OK to take a moment for an anxious, fractured mind, The world will not stop turning while you get realigned."
"If you feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities, take a break and focus on a smaller task."
"When you feel exhausted and drained, listen to your body and prioritize rest."
"If the pressure of life is making you feel stressed and unkempt, don't be afraid to take a step back and focus on self-care."
"It's alright to pause and take care of your mental health, even if it means missing out on something else."
"Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being and put your mental health first."
I'm not okay. I angry cried while he was in the bathroom getting ready. It made me so goddamn angry this morning
I'm so frustrated right now. I just can't believe he did that.
He really hurt my feelings this morning. I was so upset that I cried.
It's not fair. He makes me so angry and then acts like nothing happened.
I can't believe how disrespectful he is. I'm so tired of this.
I'm feeling really emotional right now. I just need some time to myself.
"it is DYSPHORIC, extremely difficult to live with and not taken seriously enough"
It's a constant struggle to be heard and understood when you're constantly facing such emotional distress.
It's painful to experience this feeling of disconnect and not receive the support you need.
"Living with this emotional turmoil, it feels like the world doesn't acknowledge or validate your pain."
This sense of hopelessness makes it incredibly hard to thrive and maintain a sense of well-being.
It's frustrating to feel unheard and undervalued in the midst of such deep emotional struggle.
"I feel so bad, seeing them attacked and downvoted so harshly. It makes me not want to speak up about my experiences, especially trying to access healthcare where I’m constantly misgendered. I suffer from PMDD."
"I hate seeing people get bullied online, especially when they’re just trying to share their experiences."
"It's so disheartening to see people attacked for speaking up about their experiences, it makes me feel like I can’t share mine."
"It’s incredibly frustrating to see people get downvoted for their opinions, even if they are personal and sensitive."
"I'm really tired of the constant misgendering I face when trying to access healthcare, it makes me feel unheard and unsafe."
"I just want to feel safe and supported when I share my personal experiences, but the negativity online makes it hard to feel that way."
"I feel super emotional, I feel really anxious, My lower back hurts ALOT!!"
I'm feeling a lot of stress and my body is aching.
I'm overwhelmed with emotions and my back is killing me.
"I'm a mess, I can't stop worrying and my back is in agony."
I'm so stressed out I feel like I'm going to explode and my back pain is unbearable.
I'm on edge and my lower back is in such pain I can barely move.
I'm going to have to face all of this alone again. It's shit. I wish I had anyone in my life who would stick by me through this.
I'm so tired of dealing with everything on my own.
This is just another thing I have to handle by myself.
"I feel so isolated, like no one really understands what I'm going through."
I'm starting to lose hope that anyone will ever be there for me.
It feels like I'm always the one who's left holding the bag.
feeling anxiety and irritability
I'm feeling really anxious and irritable today.
I'm struggling with anxiety and irritability right now.
This anxiety and irritability is making it hard to focus.
I need to find ways to manage this anxiety and irritability.
I'm hoping this anxiety and irritability will pass soon.
"been diagnosed with PMDD since 14...I'm looking for advice or suggestions from ladies of similar age...I didn't mind Ocella, but shortly after stopping I realized how much my libido had been affected while on it. I'm quite enjoying having that back and maybe it's because I'm older but either way I don't want to lose that again."
Wanting to kms. Feeling hopeless and discouraged. Intrusive thoughts of kms. Crying spells. I just want to die. My existence is a burden to myself.
I'm so tired of feeling like this. I just want to end it all.
The pain is too much. I can't see a way out.
My life feels like it's falling apart. I don't know what to do anymore.
I feel like a failure. I've let everyone down.
I'm surrounded by darkness. I can't see the light.
I have this condition. Realizing why I was afraid to tell him helped me understand that he wanted autonomy over his journey in the same way I wanted autonomy over mine.
I realized that his need for independence was just as strong as mine.
"He needed to find his own way, just as I did."
We both had the same desire for freedom.
He was driven by the same kind of personal growth I was.
We were both trying to discover who we were.
"I didn't learn about PMDD until about 6 months ago. He was a bad alcoholic and I made a few mistakes I'm not proud of, which I'm sure only fueled his drinking. In more recent months tho, I'm learning CBD helps PMDD more THC."
"I only recently learned about PMDD, and I'm still trying to figure out how to manage it."
"It's been really hard dealing with PMDD, especially on top of everything else going on."
I'm trying to be more mindful of my mental health and the impact of my actions on others.
"I'm hoping that CBD will help me manage my PMDD symptoms, but it's a work in progress."
I'm doing my best to learn more about PMDD and find ways to cope with it.
I feel like I have lost the woman my man fell in love with and has knowns for years... I absolutely know that I am not the same person before PMDD took over.
"I feel like I'm losing myself, the person he fell in love with."
"It's like I'm a stranger in my own body, a shadow of the woman he knew."
"This PMDD is changing me, making me someone I don't recognize, someone he might not even love anymore."
"I'm scared he's going to leave, that he won't love this new, different me."
"I just want to be the woman he fell in love with again, the one he knew and cherished."
Sobbing too. I'm in hell week.
"I can't believe how much I'm crying, it's like I'm going through hell."
"This week has been so rough, I feel like I'm going insane."
"Everything is just awful, I feel like I'm living in a nightmare."
"I can't even express how bad this week has been, it's the worst."
"This week has been so stressful, I'm at my breaking point."
I felt so fucking alone!!
"I'm so utterly alone, it hurts."
I feel like I'm completely isolated from everyone.
This feeling of loneliness is unbearable.
I just want someone to understand how alone I feel.
I've never felt this isolated and alone before.
took a period of trial and error
It was a learning process that involved a lot of experimentation.
I had to go through a lot of failures before I succeeded.
It took a lot of effort and some mistakes to get things right.
I learned a lot from my mistakes.
I had to try different things until I found what worked.
Prozac for a PMDD sufferer works almost immediately and can be taken in the 15 day hell window and adjusted as needed. I think that's awesome and that it's amazing how unique PMDD actually is.
"Prozac is a life-saver for PMDD, it kicks in right away and can be adjusted as you need it throughout that awful two-week period."
"I'm so grateful for Prozac, it's a game-changer for PMDD and makes those tough days so much more manageable."
"It's amazing how quickly Prozac works for PMDD, it's like a switch flips and I feel so much better."
"It's incredible how Prozac can be adjusted during that PMDD window, it's truly personalized medicine."
"Prozac is a testament to how unique and complex PMDD is, it's such a specific and effective treatment."
it took a period of trial and error. We settled on Prozac
We experimented with different approaches before finding the right solution.
It was a long process of exploration and adjustment until we found the right fit.
We tried many different options before finally discovering the one that worked.
"Through a series of tests and adjustments, we landed on the best course of action."
It was a journey of exploration and refinement until we arrived at the ideal outcome.
I feel like my PMDD is pretty well managed with it
My PMDD symptoms have been significantly reduced since I started using this.
This treatment has been very effective in controlling my PMDD.
I'm feeling much better since I've been taking this medication for my PMDD.
My PMDD is much more manageable now thanks to this.
I've found a good way to manage my PMDD with this.
if I try to take it outside my luteal phase it makes me feel horrid and like I am getting serotonin poisoning
"If I try to do that outside of the luteal phase, I feel like I'm getting serotonin poisoning."
"It makes me feel awful when I attempt it during any other phase, like I'm going to have a serotonin overdose."
"It's like my body is rejecting it outside of the luteal phase, and I feel terrible, like I'm going to get a serotonin overload."
"I can't take it outside of my luteal phase, it makes me feel so bad, like I'm getting serotonin poisoning."
I get this horrible feeling like serotonin poisoning whenever I try to do it outside of the luteal phase.
"I am switching from my current SSRI Lexapro to Zoloft in the hopes it will help my PMDD, because Lexapro did nothing."
I'm trying Zoloft because Lexapro didn't help my PMDD at all.
"I'm hoping Zoloft will work for my PMDD, Lexapro was useless."
I'm switching to Zoloft because Lexapro wasn't effective for my PMDD.
"Zoloft is my new hope for managing my PMDD, Lexapro did nothing for me."
I'm making the change to Zoloft because Lexapro had no effect on my PMDD.
"Welbutrin gave me panic attacks. I take Prozac and Venlafaxine, and the combo works pretty well for me."
"I've tried a lot of different medications, but this combination of Prozac and Venlafaxine seems to be the best for me."
"I used to have a lot of anxiety, but since I started taking Prozac and Venlafaxine, I feel much better."
"I was really struggling with depression and anxiety, but now I'm feeling much more stable thanks to Prozac and Venlafaxine."
"I've been on a lot of different antidepressants, but this combo of Prozac and Venlafaxine has been the most effective for me."
I'm happy to finally have a medication combination that works for me - Prozac and Venlafaxine have made a huge difference in my life.
"Anytime I experience even a little bit of frustration it turns into breaking things, throwing things, hurting myself, ... I’ve even looked in the mirror when I get into these episodes and my face doesn’t look the same. My eyes don’t look right. ... I’ve put a scarf around my neck and tried to choke myself during these episodes. I’ve grabbed scissors and knives and have tried to hurt myself with them."
"Ben en ufak bir hayal kırıklığı yaşadığımda bile kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, eşyaları kırıyorum, fırlatıyorum, kendime zarar veriyorum..."
"Bu öfke nöbetleri sırasında aynaya baktığımda kendimi tanıyamaz hale geliyorum, gözlerim bile garip görünüyor."
Bir keresinde kendimi boğmak için boynuma bir eşarp sardım.
Bu nöbetler sırasında makas ve bıçak alıp kendime zarar vermeye çalıştım.
"Beni bu kadar öfkelendiren şeyin ne olduğunu bilmiyorum, ama kendime zarar vermeden duramam."
I’ve been suffering with PMDD for a while. The last few years have been very hard... I am diagnosed with PMDD. The last year has been a gradual slope into utter exhaustion.
"I've been struggling with PMDD for a long time, it's been really tough."
"The past few years have been a blur of exhaustion and pain, I'm diagnosed with PMDD."

"It's so infuriating. They're essentially saying I should just deal with this on my own, even though it's impacting my physical and mental health."

"My PMDD symptoms appeared around the same time I began experiencing perimenopause, likely due to the hormonal changes associated with it."

"I feel like I'm constantly battling against this darkness, and it's making it difficult to form genuine relationships."
"Every month, even if I tell myself it's the hormones and it will pass, I feel like I am a different person. Everything agitates me, I get a lot of flashbacks from bad past events in my life and my bpd symptoms act up. I start thinking that nobody cares about me and I would be better off dead. I start resenting people for what they've done to me and I just feel like I become such a pessimistic and evil person. I start acting mean to others for no reason."
"Every month, I feel like a different person, even though I know it's just the hormones."
"I'm always haunted by the memories of my past trauma, and it feels like I'm never going to escape it."
"My BPD symptoms make it so hard to see the good in the world, and I end up feeling like a terrible person."
I get so caught up in my own negativity that I end up pushing away the people who care about me.
"Sometimes, I feel like I'm just going through the motions, like I'm not even in control of my own body."
"I can’t get out of bed, im so depressed and anxious, ive been arguing with my friends due to paranoia, im making my mum come home early from work to help me but i just don’t know how to cope being sober."
"I feel like I'm trapped in my own head, everything feels overwhelming and I just can't seem to handle it."
"The anxiety is making me feel so isolated, I can't even talk to my friends without getting into an argument."
"I'm so exhausted from constantly fighting these feelings, I just want to sleep and escape it all."
"It's like I'm drowning in my own thoughts, and I can't seem to find a way to surface."
"I know I need to stay sober, but right now I feel like I'm losing control and I'm scared."
"• Crying non stop for 4 days • So overwhelmed the sound of my dogs barking made me feel violent • Thoughts of severe self harm • So much sweating • Telling my boyfriend he should just leave because who wants to live with someone who goes through this every month. • I couldn’t leave the house, I was like frozen with a weird fear. • Was at emergency for 7 hours CONVINCED I had a Kidney infection, it was my cramps they had travelled from my theighs to my stomach. And because I was hunched over for days I had blocked gas too, is this a thing? • The tiredness with the weak muscles? Why?"
I felt like I was going to explode from the inside out.
I was in so much pain I couldn't even think straight.
Every part of my body felt like it was betraying me.
"I just wanted to disappear, to not exist anymore."
I felt like I was losing control of my own mind and body.
"I’ve felt so depressed and anxious I can’t handle it... I feel like everyone hates me, I’m alone, have no friends etc. I’m on the verge of tears rn for no reason I fucking hate this so much."
I'm so overwhelmed by sadness and worry that I feel like I'm going to break down.
"The feeling of isolation and loneliness is crushing me, it's like I'm drowning in despair."
"I'm just exhausted from constantly battling these negative thoughts, I just want it all to stop."
"It's so frustrating, I can't even explain how much this is all getting to me, I just feel hopeless."
"I just feel like I'm stuck in a loop of negativity, I can't see any way out of this dark place."
"feeling like i am greasy, noticeably getting a bit cranky and moody with my dad. ... become satan. ... incredibly high strung and not really getting along with my dad anymore. ... why am i such an asshole that is CERTAIN that i am being hunted down on my period?"
"I'm feeling so irritable and on edge, like I'm turning into a monster, especially when I'm around my dad."
"My hormones are raging, and I can't help but snap at everyone, especially my dad."
"I feel like I'm transforming into a different person, becoming increasingly grumpy and difficult to be around."
"This period is making me feel like a completely different person, and I'm taking it out on my dad."
"My temper is getting shorter, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing control, especially when I'm around my dad."
"I blew up my life, threw temper tantrums, gave up on everything, wanted to end myself, had a wicked migraine, sweated through my sheets three nights in a row, felt nauseous as fuck, felt beyond disassociated, couldn’t and wouldn’t leave the bed, isolated…"
"I felt like I was spiraling out of control, every aspect of my life crumbling around me."
"The pain was all-consuming, physical and emotional, making me want to shut down completely."
"Everything felt pointless, hopeless, and I just wanted to disappear."
"It felt like my body was betraying me, filled with agony and exhaustion."
"I was trapped in a cycle of despair, unable to see a way out."
I often feel so bad and feel so so ugly and worthless and horrible after my period. I’m so irritated all the time and even angry for no reason... I often feel better right after my period starts but I don’t feel good for long... I’m kind of reckless...
"My period makes me feel like a completely different person, like a shadow of myself."
"The days leading up to my period are the worst, I feel like I'm losing my mind."
"I know I shouldn't let my period affect me so much, but I can't help it, it feels like I'm under a spell."
"I feel so much better when my period is over, but the relief doesn't last long enough."
"I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster during my period, it's hard to keep up."
I try my best to prepare myself for my PMDD every month but nothing works. I just want to go away peacefully. I need someone to help me die. Please. I’m in so much pain.
"I feel so hopeless, I can't even see a way out of this pain."
"Every month is a struggle, and I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting."
I'm trapped in this cycle of agony and I just want it to stop.
"This pain is unbearable, and I'm so desperate for relief."
"I'm reaching out for help, but I feel like I'm drowning in despair."
I struggle with anything proestorgen based. I let her know I've had a bad few months and have felt like PMDD most of the time. I'm so sad :( honestly feel so lost. I'm terrified of doing PMDD with no treatment again
"I'm really struggling with the emotional ups and downs lately, it feels like PMDD has been a constant companion."
"I feel so overwhelmed by these intense emotions, I just don't know what to do."
"It's scary to think about going through this without any help, I just want to feel normal again."
"I'm scared of the emotional roller coaster, it's really taking a toll on me."
"I feel like I'm losing myself in this emotional turmoil, I need to find a way to manage it."
I have PMDD and IBS. Is there anything that can help PMDD during studies?
"I'm struggling with PMDD and IBS, and it's making studying really difficult."
I'm wondering if there are any tips or treatments that might help manage my PMDD symptoms while I'm studying.
I'm looking for ways to cope with PMDD while I'm trying to focus on my studies.
"Is there anything that can help with the symptoms of PMDD, particularly while I'm trying to concentrate on studying?"
Do you know of any strategies for managing PMDD symptoms during periods of intense study?
I feel so hungry like I’ve been starved for days and eat so much... I start crying over anything and everything... I am SO MEAN to myself for about a week to the point where I start thinking id be better off dead... I’ll have insomnia for a couple of nights and only be able to sleep for a few hours... my back will start hurting badly.
I feel like I'm losing control and my emotions are all over the place.
"It's like my body is betraying me, everything hurts and I can't seem to stop."
"I just want to curl up in a ball and disappear, I feel so exhausted and overwhelmed."
"I feel so hopeless and helpless, like nothing will ever get better."
"I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster of emotions, one minute I'm happy, the next I'm crying."
i've been on it for around 2 weeks.
I've been working on this project for about two weeks.
It's been about two weeks since I started this.
I've been focused on this task for the past couple of weeks.
I've been dedicated to this for the last two weeks.
I've been putting in a lot of effort on this for the past two weeks.
"I've been feeling so lonely recently and I hate the job, the people, and the city I'm in right now... I've been stressing about job hunting after my stint right now... The past 2 weeks have been so hard mentally, and my period isn't showing any signs of coming yet. I've been so clingy to my partner recently because of it but I also need to give him space... I feel so lost right now!"
I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now. It feels like everything is crashing down on me.
This whole job search is making me feel so anxious. I just want to find something stable and fulfilling.
It's hard to feel positive when everything feels so chaotic and uncertain.
I feel like I'm constantly on edge and I just need to find some peace of mind.
I wish I could just hit the reset button and start over.
"I felt an overwhelming grief, as if I had just lost someone. I was crying for no reason and felt like the world was ending. I almost quit my job and walked out because I felt so bad"
"I was so heartbroken, it felt like I was in mourning."
"The weight of sadness was crushing me, I couldn't function."
I was completely overwhelmed by a sense of loss and despair.
"My emotions felt like they were spiraling out of control, I couldn't stop the tears."
"It was like a dark cloud had settled over me, I couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel."
"I was losing hope of finding a hormonal treatment that would work for me. With my previous gyno, I remember having had a really good experience with a combination of SSRIs (paroxetine, specifically) and drospirenone + ethinyl estradiol bc - aside, of course, from the weekly migraines and risk of stroke that the birth control put me in. The antidepressant alone made me more miserable, so I had to stop everything altogether. These past two years have been absolute hell."
I was desperate for a hormonal treatment that would finally work for me.
I'd lost all hope of finding a hormonal treatment that would be effective for my condition.
I was starting to feel hopeless about finding a hormonal treatment that would actually work for me.
I was at my wit's end trying to find a hormonal treatment that would be effective.
I was getting increasingly discouraged in my search for a hormonal treatment that would provide relief.
"Thursday mid day I'm snacking on candy...and don't want to do anything but sit on the couch and eat even more candy. Today is my day off, but getting myself to do anything is a task and of course that creates horrible, intrusive thoughts about how far, lazy, boring, and pathetic I am."
"I'm so unmotivated today, even though it's my day off, I just want to veg out on the couch and eat junk food."
"My brain is telling me to be productive, but my body just wants to stay on the couch and eat all the snacks."
"I'm feeling so lazy and unproductive today, I can't even muster the energy to do anything but eat candy and watch TV."
"I'm really struggling with feeling lazy and unproductive, and it's making me feel bad about myself."
"I'm stuck in this vicious cycle of feeling guilty for not being productive, so I eat to feel better, and then I feel worse for eating."
"I have severe depression and anxiety, massive mood swings, fighting with anyone and everyone."
"I'm constantly on edge, feeling like I'm walking on eggshells."
It's a constant struggle to keep my emotions in check.
I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of negativity.
I'm exhausted from constantly fighting with myself and others.
My mental health is a constant source of stress and worry.
"I just get mad at him for it because my brain tells me he doesn't mean it or that he is just saying it so I'll be happy. ...my hormonal acne is the worst its ever been EVER, so that doesn't help."
"I know he doesn't mean to hurt me, but it still makes me angry when he says things like that."
"It's frustrating because he's always trying to make me feel better, but sometimes his words just make things worse."
"My emotions are all over the place right now, especially with this acne, and I'm not sure how to deal with it."
"He's just trying to be supportive, but I feel like he's patronizing me sometimes."
I wish he would just listen to me instead of trying to fix everything.
I don't recognise my own face. My self-esteem is low & I feel so lonely. I've had a cry today too.
I feel like I'm losing myself. I don't even know who I am anymore.
I'm struggling to find my place in the world. I don't feel connected to anyone.
I've been feeling really lost and alone lately. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere.
It's hard to be happy when you don't even recognize yourself. I just want to feel good about who I am.
I'm tired of feeling this way. I just want to feel loved and accepted.
"I feel so bloated, like I gain 6 lbs of water weight and I feel so blah."
"I'm so full, I feel like I could burst."
"I feel so heavy and sluggish, I just want to lie down."
"I'm so bloated, I can't even button my pants."
"I just ate way too much, I feel so uncomfortable."
"I'm so tired and I just want to sleep, I have no energy at all."
I am so tired of PMDD stealing my sleep. ... I basically just…. Can’t sleep. I’m surviving off of 2-4 hours if I’m extremely lucky 5. ... Sometimes I fall asleep and wake up at 2:30 and just can’t go back to bed. ... I spend about half the month like this.
"PMDD has been making it nearly impossible for me to get a decent night's sleep. I'm lucky if I manage 3-4 hours, and even then, I wake up exhausted."
"It's like PMDD is actively trying to deprive me of sleep. Some nights I'll fall asleep, only to wake up at 2 am and be unable to go back to sleep."
The fatigue from PMDD is so bad that it's really affecting my daily life. I'm constantly tired and struggling to stay awake.
"I feel like I'm constantly battling with PMDD for sleep. It's like a tug-of-war, and I'm losing."
I'm so exhausted from PMDD that I can barely function during the day. It feels like I'm living on fumes.
I am pathetic and barely functioning adult..... I feel never good enough. All the time.
"I feel like a complete failure, I just can't seem to get anything right."
I'm constantly struggling and I'm so tired of feeling like a disappointment.
"I try so hard, but I always feel like I'm falling short."
I'm drowning in self-doubt and I don't know how to escape.
"I'm just a mess, I wish I could just disappear."
I'm tired of letting PMDD step over me every month
I'm so done with PMDD controlling my life every month.
I'm not going to let PMDD dictate my life anymore.
PMDD has been holding me back for too long.
I'm ready to fight back against PMDD and take control.
I refuse to let PMDD ruin my life any longer.
I feel like shit and think I’m a terrible girlfriend. All because I couldn’t control my emotions... I’m just an emotional wreck rn.
"I'm so overwhelmed with feelings right now, it's making me feel like I'm failing at everything."
"I hate that I can't keep my emotions in check, it makes me feel like I'm constantly letting everyone down."
"I just want to be able to handle my feelings better, I feel like I'm letting my emotions control me."
"I feel like I'm falling apart, I can't even function right now."
"I'm so sorry, I know I'm not being the best girlfriend right now, I'm just a mess."
I haven't had such drastic mood swings ever in my LIFE.
I've never experienced such extreme shifts in emotions.
My mood has been incredibly erratic lately.
These mood swings are the most intense I've ever felt.
I can't remember ever feeling this emotionally unstable.
I've never felt such a wild rollercoaster of emotions.
"With my body dysmorphia it used to give me such anxiety and anguish to see my chest size increase it was HORRIBLE. So for me, I'm willing to endure cramps rather than having extra panic attacks."
"My body dysmorphia made me so uncomfortable with my changing body, I'd rather deal with cramps than the anxiety and anguish of seeing my chest size increase."
"I used to feel such intense distress and anxiety over my chest size that it was a truly terrible experience, so I'd rather deal with the discomfort of cramps than face that again."
"The anxiety and anguish I felt about my body changed made it so horrible, I'd rather endure cramps than face it again."
"I was so anxious and distressed about my chest size increasing that it was a truly awful experience.  So, for me, cramps are a better option than the extra panic attacks I'd experience."
"Because of my body dysmorphia, I used to feel so much anxiety and anguish over my chest size that I would rather deal with the discomfort of cramps than face that again."
My body feels achey and my belly swells like I’m 6 months pregnant. I feel physically and mentally horrible
"I'm feeling so run down, my body aches and I'm bloated like I swallowed a watermelon."
"I feel like I'm coming down with something, my muscles are sore and my stomach is a balloon."
"Everything hurts, my head is pounding and I feel like I'm going to explode."
I'm completely exhausted and I can't seem to shake this awful feeling of being sick.
My body feels like it's made of lead and I haven't had the energy to even think straight.
"I always feel insane... I have the worst mood swings, anger, anxiety, and depression a week before, during, and a week after my cycle... This is so exhausting and I feel like I never get a break."
"I'm constantly on edge before, during, and after my period, like a rollercoaster of emotions."
"My mood swings are so bad, I feel like I'm going crazy every month."
"The emotional rollercoaster of my cycle is unbearable, I just want a break."
"It's like my body is against me, with these intense mood swings and anxiety."
"I feel like a prisoner in my own body during my cycle, trapped in a cycle of exhaustion and despair."
I'm trying literally anything to feel less angry all the time.
I'm doing everything I can to calm myself down.
I'm desperate to find a way to control my anger.
I'm willing to try anything to stop feeling so angry all the time.
I'm trying every trick in the book to manage my anger.
I'm at my wit's end trying to find a way to deal with my anger.
"Whenever I see an old lady, I think 'She survived THIS shit? No way, I'm not going to make it.'"
"Whenever I see someone older than me, I wonder how they made it this far."
"Every time I see someone with a long life, I think about all the challenges they've overcome."
"I often look at people who are older and think, 'How did they make it through all of that?'"
Seeing people who have lived long lives makes me realize how resilient humans can be.
Sometimes I think about the things I've been through and wonder how I'll ever make it to that age.
"I keep being like hyper anxious, i feel like im going insane... I fear so much atm. I fear going insane so much when the doom/paranoia starts. I have also DPDR disorder which gets worse at times. I fear i will just start seeing things that are scary."
"I'm so terrified of losing control, of slipping into madness. It feels like everything is getting worse, and I can't shake this feeling that something terrible is going to happen."
"The anxiety is crippling, I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking. It's like a dark cloud hanging over me, and I can't seem to escape it."
"The fear is constant, gnawing at the edges of my mind. I'm terrified of the hallucinations, the paranoia, the sheer terror that washes over me in waves."
"My DPDR makes everything feel unreal, like I'm living in a nightmare. I'm trapped in my own head, surrounded by my fears and anxieties."
"It's like I'm constantly on edge, bracing myself for the next attack. I'm exhausted from fighting these thoughts, but I can't seem to stop them."
"I'm mad, angry, sensitive, crying, embarrassed...my main problem rn is getting my period in the next week or sooner."
"I'm so frustrated right now, everything feels so overwhelming."
"I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster, going from happy to angry in a second."
I just want to curl up in bed and disappear for a while.
"I'm feeling so out of control, like I can't even manage my own emotions."
I wish I could just press a button and make this feeling go away.
I had a massive breakdown (panic attack so severe I lost my vision and started convulsing) and ended up in the ER for paranoid delusions and hallucinations
"I had a complete mental collapse, I was seeing things and couldn't control my body, and they had to take me to the hospital."
"My anxiety got so bad I couldn't see and was having seizures, I was convinced everyone was out to get me."
"I went into a full-blown panic attack, I was hallucinating and my body wouldn't stop shaking, and they rushed me to the hospital."
"I lost it completely, I couldn't tell what was real and my body was spasming, I had to be taken to the emergency room."
"My mind was racing, I couldn't see straight and I was having involuntary movements, the doctors thought I was having a psychotic episode."
I'm so so sad exhausted I feel yucky my head hurts my eyes are so red and puffy and it's so hot.
"I feel terrible, everything hurts and I just want to crawl back into bed."
"I'm so sick and tired, I just want to go home and sleep."
"My body is aching, my head is pounding, and I just feel awful."
"I'm exhausted, my head is throbbing, and I feel like I'm coming down with something."
"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I feel miserable and I just want to feel better."
my anxiety is SO BAD today- I’m on day 10 and kinda in the middle of my follicular phase and I’ve been having so many headaches and nightmares and THE WORST anxiety! I also keep seeing black and feeling lightheaded when I’m stood up

"I’m feeling so dizzy and lightheaded, I’m worried I might faint."
"I’m so anxious I’m seeing black spots and feeling faint, this is awful."
struggling with PMS / PMDD phase way too long
PMS / PMDD symptoms are really getting me down this month.
I've been feeling awful for weeks because of PMS / PMDD.
"This PMS / PMDD phase just won't end, I'm so tired of it."
I feel like I'm stuck in this PMS / PMDD cycle.
I can't seem to shake this PMS / PMDD feeling.
I do have an increase in my health anxiety before my period so I’m getting increasingly worried.
"My period is coming soon and my health anxiety is getting worse, it’s really concerning me."
"I'm feeling more and more anxious about my health as my period approaches, it’s getting out of control."
"I've been experiencing heightened health anxiety leading up to my period, I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed."
My health anxiety always spikes before my period and this time it’s becoming a major issue.
"I’m worried about my health, especially since my period is coming soon and my anxiety is getting worse."
I’m a big hypochondriac and i think i just want some security in knowing this potentially isn’t just a me thing.
I'm always worried about being sick and it's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.
"I'm a bit of a worrier, especially when it comes to my health, and I find it reassuring to know others feel the same."
"I tend to overthink things, especially when it comes to my health, and it's helpful to know I'm not the only one who does."
"I get anxious about getting sick, so it's good to know I'm not alone in this feeling."
"I'm always looking for reassurance when it comes to my health, and finding out others share similar anxieties helps."
"I was extremely cranky, low energy, and a lot of depression symptoms. I couldn’t clean do laundry or take care of myself."
"I felt so down and out, I couldn't even muster the energy to get out of bed."
"My depression was so bad, I couldn't even manage the simplest tasks."
"The fatigue and sadness were overwhelming, I couldn't even take care of myself."
"I was completely drained and unmotivated, I couldn't bring myself to do anything."

"I feel great for a week after my period ends, but the rest of the month is tough."
"The week after my period is the only time I feel good, the rest is just awful."
"I usually have one good week out of the month, right after my period, then it's downhill from there."
"The only good week I get is the one right after my period, the rest is just misery."
My period is so bad that the week after it's over is the only good week I get in the whole month.
"I want to be alone. I want to be alone at my home. ... I kinda lock myself up in bed jail for a few days because I can't handle human interactions, I have ruined so many friendships because of this as I stop hanging out with them and completely ghost them during this phase."
"I need some time to myself, away from everyone."
I feel overwhelmed by social interaction and need some time to recharge.
I get really introverted sometimes and just need to be alone for a while.
"I'm not good at dealing with people when I'm feeling this way, so I need to isolate myself for a bit."
"I know I'm pushing people away, but I can't help it when I'm in this state."
i do well for a few weeks and then it’s like taking 10 steps back. the amount of effort and progress i made feels like for nothing and i’m a failure... it’s been 2 years of mental torture. i genuinely feels like i’m a different person altogether?... i don’t know how to communicate that to people who don’t deal with this?
I'm so tired of feeling like I'm constantly going backwards. It's exhausting.
It's like I'm stuck in a cycle of progress and regression. I can't seem to break free.
"I put in so much effort, but it feels like I'm always starting over. It's disheartening."
"Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped in a mental prison, unable to escape the pain."
"I wish I could just explain what it's like to live with this, but words fail me."
"i have ADHD, suspected autism, OCD, anxiety, PTSD and celiac disease. i feel as though literally all of these conditions contribute to making my PMDD worse in some way."
"I've been diagnosed with so many different conditions, it's hard to separate which ones are impacting my PMDD the most."
"My PMDD symptoms feel amplified by the anxiety, OCD, and PTSD I struggle with."
"It's like my PMDD is a magnifying glass for all my other conditions, making everything feel so much worse."
"It's exhausting trying to manage all these diagnoses, especially when they all seem to feed off of each other."
"I'm not sure if it's the ADHD, the autism, or the celiac disease, but something about them all makes my PMDD so much harder to deal with."
"I have the worst anxiety and panic right now, it’s PMDD"
"I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious right now, it's probably the PMDD."
"My anxiety and panic are really bad right now, I think it's because of my PMDD."
"I'm having a really tough time with my anxiety and panic right now, it's PMDD."
"This anxiety and panic is so intense, it must be my PMDD."
"I'm struggling so much with anxiety and panic right now, it's definitely the PMDD."
"I feel so isolated and alone in my journey with pmdd & pms. My partner gets angry at me and tells me to “grow up” and “stop acting like a child” when he doesn’t even comprehend how this disables me. I don’t know how to explain that I am not the one in control of the tears... I was considering doing stupid things (I won’t, I promise) and talk to someone and just release some of my anguish."
"I feel so misunderstood, like no one truly grasps the debilitating impact of PMDD and PMS."
"It's frustrating when my partner dismisses my struggles as childish behavior, failing to understand the powerlessness I feel during these times."
"The emotional turmoil is so overwhelming, I find myself wanting to lash out, but I know I need to find a healthier way to cope."
"I long for someone to listen without judgment, someone who can validate my pain and offer support during these challenging times."
"I'm desperate for understanding and validation, not criticism or dismissal. I need someone to see the real me, the me that is struggling with these invisible illnesses."
"I get to feel like it's the end of the world and also that I don't exist every month... I dissociate and cry at the sound of a teams ping... I feel like I'm fighting against my own body. I love my body, I love that I can lift more the first two days of my period I love how alive I feel when I'm ovulating I don't want to miss out on that but damn PMDD sucks!!!"
"I hate the roller coaster of emotions that my period brings, but I also wouldn't trade it for anything."
"The physical and emotional pain of PMDD is real, but it doesn't diminish the joy of feeling my body's power at other times."
It's a constant battle between appreciating my body and feeling completely disconnected from it.
"I'm so grateful for the strength I experience during ovulation, but the dark days of PMDD make it all the more intense."
"I'm tired of feeling like I'm losing myself every month, but I know I'm not alone in this fight."
feels like used me and villainized me...crushingly lonely and I just want this period of detachment to get over quickly because I am in so much pain and feel so betrayed.
"I feel so used and betrayed, like I was made the villain in their story."
"This crushing loneliness is unbearable, I just want to move on from this feeling of detachment."
"The pain is so intense, I feel like I've been stabbed in the back."
It's like they took everything I gave them and turned it against me.
I'm drowning in this feeling of betrayal and I just want to escape.
I’m DEEP DEEP deep down in it. My husband doesn’t care anymore I’ve ruined everything. I’m not okay and no one cares about me. I feel so lonely I have NO ONE!!! I’m seriously not wanting to go on. It’s scary!!!! 
I feel so lost and hopeless. I've made a mess of things and I don't know how to fix it.
I'm so alone and no one seems to understand what I'm going through.
I'm in so much pain and I just want it all to stop.
I'm so scared and I don't know what to do.
I feel like I'm drowning and I can't catch my breath.
I feel extremely unhinged. ... I just feel mentally awful today. ... I was seething so hard I was literally having a heat flash. ... Not feeling like I want to rip out of my own skin. It’s exhausting.
"I'm feeling so out of control, like everything is unraveling."

"I'm overwhelmed by negative thoughts, and I'm just feeling completely drained."
"Everything feels so heavy and overwhelming, I feel like I can barely breathe."
"I'm so frustrated and angry, I feel like I could explode."
"I feel like Grandpa Joe. I also have ADHD and complex PTSD. I think this combo means most prevalent symptom every month is exhaustion. I can function fine after bleeding and before ovulation, sometimes do loads of functioning! But after ovulation I become exhausted and spend a lot of time in bed."
"I'm basically living the Grandpa Joe life - I have ADHD and complex PTSD, so exhaustion is my most common symptom."
"It feels like I'm stuck in a constant cycle of energy and fatigue, thanks to my ADHD and PTSD."

"My ADHD and PTSD make it hard to function, especially after ovulation. The fatigue hits me hard and I just want to sleep."
"I feel like I'm constantly on a rollercoaster of energy levels, with ADHD and PTSD making the ride a bit rough, especially after ovulation."
"I give away my time and effort even if I'm breaking down inside... I also feel very 'at peace with myself', but it's a very scary peace, the peace before the danger. This is because the less I look for myself, the more I can be abused, or giving up on trying to fight for my life in general and try to fight for other's sake... having a suicidal intent, etc."
"I'm so tired of constantly putting everyone else's needs before my own, even when I'm falling apart inside."
"It's like I'm walking on eggshells, constantly afraid of upsetting someone or letting them down."

"I'm so lost and alone, and I don't know how to escape this feeling of being trapped."
"I can get sad and depressed, feel battered, This body and mind are too much to bear."
"I feel so overwhelmed by everything, it's like my body and mind are fighting against each other."
"Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, it's just too much to handle."

"I felt extremely bloated and puffy, with cramps, weight gain, insomnia, and cravings."
"I was experiencing extreme bloating and puffiness, along with cramping, weight gain, insomnia, and cravings."
"This time, the bloating and puffiness were intense, along with cramps, weight gain, insomnia, and cravings."

"Along with the usual bloating and puffiness, I had cramps, weight gain, insomnia, and cravings."

"I'm so exhausted, it feels like I'm wading through molasses."
"Every step is a struggle, like my legs are made of concrete."
"My body feels heavy and sluggish, like I'm carrying the weight of the world."
"I'm completely drained, it's like all my energy has been sapped away."
"My muscles are screaming for a break, I can barely move."
The fact I survived this long is a miracle. Is this a cry for help? Yeah but again this is where we’re at.
"It feels like a miracle I made it this far, but is that just a cry for help? This is where we're at, I guess."
"I'm still here, somehow. Is that a cry for help? I don't know. This is our reality."
"I'm surprised I've lasted this long. Is that a cry for help? It feels like it, but it's the truth."
"I'm barely hanging on, but here I am. Is this a cry for help? Maybe, but it's where we are."
"It's a miracle I'm still standing. Is this a cry for help? Maybe, but it's the truth. This is where we are now."
I feel so good rn!! I have so much energy and actually feel happy?! ... I’m nervous knowing that this feeling is usually only temporary :(
"I'm really enjoying this moment, but I know it won't last forever."
"This happiness feels so real, but I can't shake the feeling that it's going to disappear soon."
"It's amazing to feel this good, but I'm already dreading when it ends."
"I'm so energized and content right now, but I'm afraid it won't last."
"This is the best I've felt in a long time, but I can't help but worry that it won't last."
This illness is so much extra work and financial expense and maintenance.. on top of my day job and it’s alienating because not many people understand
"This illness feels like a second job, with all the extra work, expense, and upkeep."
"It's frustrating that my illness takes up so much time and energy, on top of my regular responsibilities."
"Dealing with this illness is exhausting, not just physically but also financially and emotionally."
It's isolating to feel like no one truly understands the impact this illness has on my life.
"I wish people understood how much this illness impacts my daily life, it's a constant drain."
I was diagnosed with PMDD at 21. I’m typically fine first half of my cycle. Bad the second half. This time the 24 hours before I got my period I was put under extreme stress regarding my job.  Now I can’t sleep without getting into anxiety induced dreams if I sleep At all. This affects every aspect of my life without my control.
"I've been dealing with PMDD since I was 21, and it's a real struggle."
"The second half of my cycle is always the worst with PMDD, and this month has been particularly bad."
The stress at work the day before my period really amplified my PMDD symptoms.
I can't seem to get a good night's sleep because of the anxiety-inducing dreams I have.
"It's frustrating how PMDD impacts so many areas of my life, and I feel like I have no control over it."
"I may tell my partner a million times I’m in pmdd and to leave me alone and he forgets. Tonight he tried to have some serious discussion with me about his feelings and it will turn into a huge fight. I’m sick of fighting and huge upsets. ... Sometimes when cycles are seeming better, I’ll be doing ok and we’ll be talking and forget and suddenly agitation spikes out of nowhere !!!!!"
"My partner knows about my PMDD, but he still forgets and tries to have serious conversations during the tough times. It always ends in a big fight, and I'm just so tired of it."
"I've explained my PMDD to him so many times, but he keeps forgetting. He tries to talk to me when I'm feeling really bad, and it just escalates into an argument. I'm exhausted from all the fighting."
"I've been telling him for months that I have PMDD and to leave me alone during those times. He forgets though, and tonight he tried to have a serious conversation. It's going to end badly."
"It's like he doesn't hear me when I tell him about my PMDD. He keeps trying to talk to me when I'm not okay, and it always leads to a huge fight. I'm at my wit's end."
"I'm so frustrated. My partner knows about my PMDD and how it affects me, but he still forgets. He tries to talk to me about his feelings when I'm at my worst, and it just causes more problems. I'm tired of fighting."
i’m questioning my relationship and how close i feel to my partner
I'm not sure if our connection is as strong as it used to be.
I'm starting to wonder if we're really on the same page anymore.
I'm feeling a bit distant from my partner and it's making me uneasy.
I'm questioning the depth of our bond and whether we're truly compatible.
I'm not sure if we're growing together or drifting apart.
"I'm suddenly really grossed out by men. Like can't even watch them in porn grossed out and the sight of a penis makes me want to vomit. Women, however…I don’t feel like an intense sexual need for them, but I am finding a deep attraction for them during this time."
"I can't stand to look at a man right now, I feel physically repulsed by them. It's weird, I know, but it's like my whole perspective on them has shifted."
"I'm totally turned off by men, they make me feel uncomfortable. I can't even watch them in porn without feeling disgusted."
"It's so strange, but I'm completely repulsed by men. I can't even look at them without feeling sick to my stomach."
"I'm going through this phase where I just can't stand to look at men, it's like they're a different species to me now."
"I'm finding myself really grossed out by men, like the sight of them makes me want to vomit. I don't know what's going on, but it's definitely affecting my sexual desire."
i’m not myself for 2-3 weeks a month and i hate everything about the person i become. and there’s nothing i can do to stop it. i feel irrational and crazy and i lash out at and mistreat everyone i love. i’m in the backseat of my own mind and im powerless to stop it.
"I feel like I'm trapped in my own body, watching myself act in ways I don't recognize, and there's nothing I can do to control it."
"It's like I become a completely different person for weeks at a time, and I despise the thoughts and actions that come from this altered state."
"It's heartbreaking to watch myself lose control and hurt the people I care about most, and I can't bring myself to stop it."
"I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality, and it's terrifying to witness my own transformation into someone I don't want to be."
"It's like my mind is a battlefield, and I'm helpless as I watch my sanity crumble and the darkness take over."
Cried this morning bc my family is hanging out and I’m too stressed and overwhelmed to go. And also I’m convinced that when the voice in my head tells me to veer left imma do it. Also woke up with stomach pain. Everything feels awful and I can’t believe I have to do this tomorrow and the next day forever!!
"I'm so exhausted and anxious, I can't even handle a simple family gathering."
This constant pressure is making me physically ill. I just want to crawl under the covers and disappear.
"I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I need a break, but I don't know how to make it happen."
"The voice in my head is telling me to run away, but I know I can't. I have to keep going."
This isn't sustainable. I need to find a way to manage this stress before it consumes me.
I’ve had PMDD for about 2 years... I need support because i’m not telling absolutely anyone about it.
"I haven't told anyone about this, and it's been so hard to deal with on my own."
It's isolating because I can't talk to anyone about what I'm going through.
"I feel like I'm carrying this burden all alone, and it's getting heavier every day."
"I'm scared to open up about it, but I need someone to understand."
I'm reaching out for help because I can't handle this alone anymore.
I discovered my autism only a few years ago and as I work on unmasking it seems like PMDD symptoms have emerged/gotten worse.
"I've been working on embracing my autism, and it feels like my PMDD symptoms have become more noticeable."
"Since learning about my autism, I've noticed a connection to my PMDD symptoms that I hadn't realized before."
"My autism diagnosis has made me more aware of my body and how it reacts, and now I'm understanding my PMDD better."
"As I've been exploring my autistic traits, I've noticed a potential link to my PMDD, which has been challenging to manage."
"It's been a journey to uncover my autism, and now I'm realizing that it might be connected to my experiences with PMDD."
"Prior to chemical menopause, I had debilitating PMDD symptoms. I tried countless other treatments with no success. Some were before my official PMDD diagnosis and some were after. I tried SNRIs, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, 3 different birth control pills, 3 different IUDs, mood stabilisers, anti-histamines, benzodiazepines, and so many different supplements and lifestyle changes."
"Before I went through chemical menopause, I was struggling with severe PMDD symptoms that really impacted my life."
I exhausted all other treatment options for my PMDD before I finally found relief in chemical menopause.
I was desperate for a solution to my PMDD and tried everything imaginable - from medications to birth control to lifestyle changes.
"Nothing seemed to work for my PMDD, no matter how many different treatments I tried."
"My PMDD symptoms were so severe that I was willing to try anything, but nothing seemed to help until I started chemical menopause."
"I feel like it was a bad idea because after taking 40 mg my anxiety has gotten worse these last 2 days and I’ve been having outbursts of anger, been getting agitated easily and I’ve been crying uncontrollably due to self loathing and I’ve urges to sh, I’ve also been contemplating suicide again."
"I regret taking this medication, I feel so much worse now."
"I'm having intense negative reactions to this, I'm scared."
"I feel so out of control, I can't handle this."
"I feel like this is pushing me over the edge, I need help."
"This is making my mental health worse, I need to stop."
I have pmdd. I had a minera for 9 years before the kids.
"I've been struggling with PMDD for years, it's been especially difficult since I had kids."
"My PMDD has been really hard to deal with, especially after having kids."
"Having kids has made my PMDD so much worse, it's been a real struggle."
"It's been a long nine years dealing with PMDD, and now having kids just adds to the stress."
"My PMDD has been a part of my life for a long time, even before I had kids."
"I am no longer totally dysfunctional for half a month, I feel like it’s efficacy has been waning recently with my symptoms being more severe and I may have to increase dosage, I’m just sick of this disorder and having to do shit to maintain it. Taking meds, sleeping / resting wayyy more during luteal, planning stuff around my cycle. And that doesn’t even cure it, just makes me somewhat functional but I’m still so depressed."
"I'm not completely broken all the time anymore, but the medication seems to be losing its effectiveness and I'm having to up the dosage again."
"It's been a bit better lately, I'm not completely useless for weeks on end, but I still have bad days and the meds don't seem to be working as well anymore."
"I'm making progress, I'm not constantly falling apart, but I'm still feeling so down and I'm not sure if the medication is even helping at this point."
"I'm finally getting some relief from my symptoms, I'm not completely wiped out all the time, but it's a constant battle and I'm exhausted from trying to manage everything."
"I'm feeling a little better these days, not completely lost and broken, but the medication seems to be wearing off and I'm worried about what's going to happen next."
i don’t get my period every month but when i do it hits like a truck. [...] i’m at such a loss because i want to start taking testosterone but i’m also worried how that will play in?
I'm so confused about how testosterone will affect my period.
It's really frustrating because I don't know how my body will react to testosterone.
I'm worried that starting testosterone will mess up my cycle even more.
I'm scared that testosterone will make my period even worse.
"I don't know what to do, I really want to start testosterone but I'm afraid of how it will affect my body."
"I learned I actually have PMDD, no wonder I refused to have my period and stayed on birth control for so long to skip them."
"I've been struggling with PMDD for years, which explains why I've been so resistant to going off birth control."
It finally clicked why I was so adamant about staying on birth control -  I didn't know I had PMDD.
"My doctor finally diagnosed me with PMDD, and now it makes sense why I hated my period so much."
"I'm finally getting the help I need for my PMDD, and I'm no longer afraid of my period."
I'm so relieved to finally understand why I was always so uncomfortable with my cycle -  it was PMDD all along.
"The fatigue is the worst it’s ever been, my skin is TERRIBLE with hormonal acne, the anxiety is awful."
"I feel completely drained, my skin is breaking out like crazy, and I can't shake this feeling of unease."
"I'm so exhausted, my face is a disaster zone, and I'm just overwhelmed with anxiety."
"My energy is at an all-time low, my skin looks awful, and I'm constantly on edge."
"I'm feeling totally wiped out, my skin is a mess, and I'm just anxious all the time."
"I'm so tired, my skin is breaking out everywhere, and I'm just feeling really stressed."
"I only get maybe a week and a half each month without the brain fog, anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, severe breast pain, etc. I'm struggling so much! I'm so worried about how I'm going to get through this."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling these symptoms, and it's exhausting."
"It's so frustrating to have these good days, but then they're quickly overtaken by the bad."
"I just want to feel like myself again, but it seems so far away."
I'm scared that this is going to be my new normal.
"I need to find a way to manage these symptoms, because I can't keep living like this."
"I'm recently sort of reframing my idea around my PMDD as I pursue more permanent treatment options, and I'm coming around to thinking of myself as chronically (maybe cyclically?) ill."
"I'm starting to think of my PMDD as a chronic condition, especially as I explore permanent treatment options."
"My perspective on PMDD is evolving as I seek more long-term solutions, and I'm realizing it might be a chronic, or perhaps cyclical, illness."
"As I delve into permanent treatment options for my PMDD, I'm starting to see it as a chronic, maybe even cyclical, illness."
"I'm shifting my view on my PMDD, seeing it as a chronic (maybe cyclical) illness, as I explore permanent treatment options."
"With my focus on long-term treatment for PMDD, I'm coming to terms with the possibility that it's a chronic, or perhaps cyclical, illness."
I feel so isolated like no one in my circle of friends gets it. I feel judged harshly and like they think I’m actually crazy...I also over think EVERYTHING including stuff that is from the past or scenario’s and judgements I’ve made up from some small interaction.
"I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them, constantly worried about saying or doing the wrong thing."
It's like they're all on a different wavelength and I just can't seem to connect.
I'm so scared of being judged that I end up shutting myself off from them completely.
"I just want to feel understood and accepted for who I am, but it feels like an impossible dream."
"I know I'm not crazy, but the way they look at me makes me feel like I am."
i have not noticed any change in my mood symptoms at all...i noticed little to no change in my PMDD symptoms. it honestly made my PMDD harder to treat with my antidepressant
"I haven't seen any difference in my mood since starting this medication, if anything it's made my PMDD worse."
"My PMDD symptoms haven't gotten any better, they're actually worse since I've been taking this antidepressant."
"I was hoping this would help my PMDD, but I haven't noticed any improvement at all."
"This new treatment hasn't had any impact on my PMDD symptoms, it's actually made things worse."
"My PMDD hasn't changed, but this new antidepressant is actually making it harder to manage."
"i feel worthless. i loved my job so much... i feel so useless and unproductive and worthless... i feel like a useless idiot... i feel so alone a lot these days and its been a particularly brutal pmdd cycle symptom-wise... i just had the worst chills and sweats i felt feverish and had stomach cramps... im paranoid... im just feeling very out of it and sort of dissociative, just so depressed and worthless feeling and im not in danger of harming myself i promise, im just so overwhelmed and feel like i lost what little control i had over my life. i feel like ive failed and lost a job i truly loved and excelled at."
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of disappointment and failure.
"Everything I've worked for feels like it's been washed away, leaving me empty and lost."
This feeling of worthlessness is a heavy weight I can barely carry.
I just want to disappear and forget about everything.
The pain of losing this job is like a gaping wound in my soul.
"I HATE mood swings of any kind, even the good kind. My wildest fantasy is to just be one stable, whole person for a while. That's like paradise for me."
I'm so tired of feeling like I'm constantly on a roller coaster of emotions.
"I just want to feel consistently happy and content, even if it's not always exciting."
It would be amazing to have a steady baseline of emotional well-being.
I long for the days when I don't have to worry about sudden changes in my mood.
Being able to maintain a consistent emotional state would be like a dream come true.
my parents are triggering some PMDD symptoms as they think I’m making this up for attention.
My parents are really invalidating my feelings about this situation.
I feel like my parents are dismissing my emotional needs.
It's frustrating that my parents don't believe me when I say I'm struggling.
My parents are making me feel like I'm overreacting.
I'm feeling really unheard and misunderstood by my parents.
I just had to let that shit out. I am so tired dammit I need a breakkkkkkkk!
"I can't keep this in any longer, I need to vent!"
"I'm at my wit's end, this is just too much!"
I'm about to explode if I don't get a break!
"This is driving me crazy, I need to get away from everything for a while."
"I'm so stressed out, I just need a moment to breathe."
I don't feel like myself recently and don't feel like it is helping as much as when I started. I feel so stuck with this awful illness..
I'm struggling to get better and it feels like I'm stuck in this rut.
This illness has taken over my life and I'm feeling helpless.
I'm not making any progress and it's really disheartening.
I feel like I'm losing myself to this illness and it's scary.
It's been a long time since I felt like myself and I'm starting to lose hope.
the pain is so bad i just want to dIEEEEE
"I can't take this pain anymore, I just want it to stop."
"This pain is unbearable, I just want to disappear."
"Everything hurts so much, I wish I could just fade away."
"The pain is overwhelming, I feel like I'm going to break."
"This agony is too much, I just want to escape it all."
"Every month about a week before my period I get extremely suicidal, I can barely do my job, and u spend most of my day crying. I quite literally cry all day and can’t stop. I’ve even cried on a meeting with my boss. I’m useless. It happens every month. I also usually try to break up with my bf during this period. It feels like my life is crumbling to pieces every week before my period."
"My period is like a dark cloud that hangs over me for a whole week before it arrives. I feel so hopeless and lost during this time, it's almost unbearable."
"Every month, the same thing happens: I become a shell of myself, unable to function, and the only thing I seem to do is cry. It's a horrible cycle."
"The week before my period, I'm a complete mess. My emotions are all over the place, I can't focus, and I feel like I'm going to fall apart. It's like my body is betraying me."
I'm at my absolute worst during that week before my period. It's like my mind is consumed by darkness and despair. I can't even look at myself in the mirror without feeling like a failure.
I feel like I'm losing control of my life every month during this time. I get so overwhelmed with negative emotions that it's hard to even function. My thoughts are consumed by self-hate and despair.
I've been struggling so hard to not only make meals but force myself to eat meals..I can't fucking sleep either. My period insomnia is insane. Being like.. 6 weeks sober from cutting has made everything significantly harder. I'm just tired of people..I'm so stressed. I haven't thought of suicide I just wanna sleep for a long time..
"I feel so overwhelmed by everything right now. It's hard to even eat, and I can't seem to sleep at all."
I'm exhausted both physically and mentally. I just want to curl up and disappear for a while.
"I'm trying so hard to stay strong, but everything feels like it's crashing down on me."
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting against myself. I'm trying to be healthy, but my body and mind just won't cooperate."
I just want to escape all of this for a little while. I'm so tired of being tired.
Every month before my period starts i think about killing myself. I also have body dysmorphia...
I feel so lost and hopeless in the days leading up to my period.
The emotional roller coaster I experience before my period is unbearable.
I hate how my body changes and how I feel during my period.
I feel like I'm losing control of myself before my period starts.
"It's like my body is betraying me, and I feel so alone and trapped."
I'm sobbing over how fat and ugly I am
I feel so terrible about my body.
I hate how I look in the mirror.
I wish I could just disappear.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
I feel like I'll never be happy with how I look.
I’ve had migraines for almost 3 days straight. I cried repeatedly while watching Cars with my 3 year-old yesterday… I’m just so frustrated
"I feel so helpless, I can't even enjoy a movie with my child."
This pain is making me feel like I'm losing my mind.
"I'm so tired of feeling like this, I just want to feel normal again."
"My head feels like it's going to explode, I can't take it anymore."
I hate that my migraines are keeping me from enjoying life.
"I was literally turning into an insane person about ten days before my period. My symptoms were extreme weepiness, anger, irrationality, extreme fatigue, body aches and pain, brain fog, and it would all slowly get worse and worse the closer to my period until I was deep in suicidal ideation and depression and just truly believed life was not worth living."
My PMS symptoms were so severe that I felt like I was losing my mind.
I would experience intense emotional swings and physical discomfort in the days leading up to my period.
"The week before my period, I was a complete emotional wreck, with constant crying, anger, and exhaustion."
"It was like my body was rebelling against me in the days before my period, and I felt completely out of control."
The emotional and physical toll of my PMS was so overwhelming that I would often find myself in a state of despair and hopelessness.
I'm currently taking this tea to help manage my PMDD
I'm trying this new herbal supplement to see if it can help with my premenstrual symptoms.
I've been looking into different ways to cope with my PMDD and I'm giving this tea a shot.
I'm really hoping this tea can help me manage the mood swings I get before my period.
"This tea is supposed to be good for hormonal balance, and I'm hoping it can make my PMDD a bit easier to deal with."
"I've been struggling with PMDD for a while, and I'm trying anything I can to find some relief."
"I feel totally depleted, my brain has a hard time processing, the instant rambling is making me have a hard tune being civil and keeping my composure. I need piece, quiet, and nobody around me. I'm so mentally and physically drained."
"I'm exhausted, both mentally and physically. It's hard to focus and be patient with all the noise."
I need to take a break from everything. My mind is fried and I can't even think straight.
I'm so overwhelmed by everything that I can't even process what's going on.  I need to be alone and have some quiet time.
I feel completely drained.  All the stress is making it hard to be calm and collected.
I'm at my wit's end.  I need to get away from all of this chaos and find some peace.
"I haven’t really noticed improvements in my pmdd, but I’m only now 8 days out from my period so time will tell. I’m having STRONG coffee and white wine cravings this week."
"I'm not sure if the new medication is helping my PMDD yet, but it's only been a week so I'm hoping to see results soon."
"It's too early to tell if the changes I've made to my diet are making a difference for my PMDD, but I'm hoping for the best."
"I'm really craving chocolate and ice cream this week, it must be my PMDD acting up."
"I'm feeling really anxious and irritable this week, it's definitely my PMDD."
"I'm hoping that this week will be better than last week, I was really struggling with my PMDD."
I have unbearably painful periods...I cannot strain my body or get up or do anything that raises my heart rate or my cramps will be excruciating.
I'm in so much pain during my period that even the slightest movement makes it unbearable.
"My cramps are so bad that I can barely move, let alone do anything that requires any effort."
I'm practically bedridden during my period because of the intense pain.
The pain is so severe that I have to limit my activity to avoid making it worse.
"Even just standing up can trigger excruciating cramps, so I'm basically stuck in bed."
do you ever worry which feelings are the real feelings ? Which version is the real version of you ?
Do you ever wonder if the person you show the world is truly who you are inside?
I sometimes question whether my actions are authentic or just a performance.
It's hard to know if my emotions are genuine or just a facade I've created.
"Do you ever feel like you're living a double life, one for yourself and one for everyone else?"
"Sometimes I feel like I'm playing a role, and I'm not sure who I am behind the mask."
I feel pretty good emotionally during my period and ovulation week...I already have no sex drive during the luteal phase
"My mood is really good during my period and ovulation week, but I'm not interested in sex at all during the luteal phase."
"I'm feeling great emotionally during my period and ovulation week, but my libido is totally gone during the luteal phase."
"I have a lot of energy and feel happy during my period and ovulation week, but I have no desire for sex during the luteal phase."
"My mood is really high and I'm feeling good during my period and ovulation week, but I'm not interested in sex at all during the luteal phase."
"I'm feeling really good emotionally during my period and ovulation week, but my sex drive completely disappears during the luteal phase."
I fell asleep while running an experiment and woke up on another planet . The headache was like no other and the fatigue and brain fog was so so so so bad . I literally went to the bathroom and cried for forty mins :( .
"I don't know how long I was out, but it felt like I was transported to another dimension. The disorientation was overwhelming, and my body felt like it was filled with lead."
"It felt like I was dreaming, but the throbbing pain in my head made it painfully real.  I couldn't shake this feeling that something was terribly wrong."
"The exhaustion was unlike anything I've ever felt, it was like my brain was trying to escape from my skull. I just wanted to crawl into bed and disappear."
I'm pretty sure I was hallucinating because I swear I saw a giant purple blob staring at me from the corner of the room. I thought I was going crazy.
I've never felt so utterly lost and alone.  I couldn't even tell if this was real or if I was just trapped in some bizarre nightmare.
"He always has a crisis of his own during hell week to explain why he can’t take care of our kid or clean the house for me while I’m out of commission. When I’m having trouble controlling my emotions, he asks me what’s wrong with me and acts like he’s never heard of PMDD in his life."
He always finds a way to make things harder for me when I need him the most.
He never seems to understand that I'm not always going to be able to handle everything on my own.
"He expects me to be superwoman, but he's never there to support me when I need it."
"He’s always got a reason why he can’t help me, but never offers a solution."
"He acts like I'm the only one who has problems, and he's never there to help me solve them."
"My PMDD this month was worse than usual! Like many PMDD sufferers, at this point I've tried everything under the sun and my PMDD remains with me, and is even worse than ever."
"I'm really struggling with my PMDD this month, it's been so much harder than usual."
I feel like I've tried every possible treatment for PMDD but it's still so bad.
"I'm exhausted from constantly dealing with the effects of PMDD, it feels like it's only getting worse."
"It's frustrating that there's no one-size-fits-all solution for PMDD, I've tried so many things and nothing seems to work."
"It's hard to cope with the severity of my PMDD symptoms this month, I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle."
I feel like I'm gonna faint
"I'm feeling so dizzy, I think I'm going to pass out."
"My head is spinning, I feel like I'm about to collapse."
"I'm getting lightheaded, I can barely stand."
"I feel faint, I need to sit down."
"I'm so weak, I feel like I'm going to lose consciousness."
I'm in between am I having heartburn is this a panic attack or a heart attack? I'm pretty sure it's heartburn mixed with panic I'm trying to remind myself that I do get anxiety when I'm in this phase but I'm also trying to not freak.
"I'm not sure what's happening, is this just anxiety, or something worse?"
"I feel like I'm having a heart attack, but I know I'm prone to panic attacks, so it's hard to tell."
"My chest is tight and I can't breathe, is this just a panic attack or is something serious going on?"
"This feeling is overwhelming, I don't know if it's anxiety, heartburn or something more serious."
"I'm trying to stay calm, but my heart is racing and I feel like I'm going to pass out, I hope it's just anxiety."
I just scream at some strange man in my woods with a gun that he better not be shooting towards my house. And now it’s back to silence sometimes my rage allows me to stand up in situations I normally would run and hide from lol
"I'm not sure what I was thinking, but I guess adrenaline just takes over sometimes."
"It's just so frustrating when people don't respect your space, you know?"
I guess I'm just a little jumpy after what happened last week.
"I'm not really the type to confront people, but sometimes you just have to stand up for yourself."
"Maybe I should just get a bigger dog, I think that would scare away any unwanted visitors."
"feeling disgusting in my skin (feel heavy, greasy and ugly)"
"I feel so gross, like I'm stuck in my own skin."
"I hate how heavy and greasy my skin feels, it makes me feel so ugly."
This feeling of being trapped in my own skin is unbearable.
"I just want to crawl out of my skin, I feel so uncomfortable."
"My skin feels like a second layer of grime, it's so repulsive."
I go through phases of *im going to find what works for my PMDD* and *fuck this I’ll rest in my misery*. I’ve tried multiple and they make me worse. Then I’m like woah I’m more fucked up than I thought if this works for so many people and not me.
"I feel like I'm constantly searching for a solution, but then I just want to give up and accept the pain."
"It's exhausting trying different things, only to find they make everything worse."
"I feel like I'm failing because so many others find relief from these things, but I don't."
"I'm so frustrated that I can't find something that helps, it makes me feel like I'm broken."
"Maybe I'm just doomed to suffer, I don't know what else to do."
"I can barely speak. It's almost like some kind of mental and physical paralysis...it is the saddest part about my disorder because it's something that I can't hide from the outside world. ...I couldn't emote or converse with him normally. I had nothing interesting to say or add, I felt like I was on autopilot...I couldn't help but feel so ashamed of it. ...I'm overly scrutinizing every single interaction we have, I continue to have paranoid thoughts that he wants to leave the relationship..."
"My disorder makes it hard to communicate, it feels like I'm trapped inside my own body."
"The worst part is that I can't hide this struggle from anyone, it's so visible."
"I feel completely disconnected from him, like I'm just going through the motions."
"It's so frustrating that I can't express myself freely, I feel like I'm losing a part of myself."
"I'm constantly worried that he's going to leave because of how I am, it's a constant source of anxiety."
I’ve noticed that my symptoms are now starting to extend through my period until almost the end and this meant I’ve done pretty much nothing all weekend. The amount of screen time I’ve had is insane and now I feel so overstimulated and unable to calm down to sleep. Anxious. Anxiety has been almost bigger than depression this go around and I just don’t know how to deal 😩
"My period symptoms are getting worse, and I haven't been able to do anything this weekend."
"I've been staring at screens all weekend, and now I feel overwhelmed and can't sleep."
"I'm really struggling with anxiety this month, it's been harder than the depression."
The anxiety is so bad I can't even relax enough to sleep. 😩
I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of anxiety and exhaustion.
"I wake up every morning wanting to ball my eyes out and get super reactive if any of them tease me about the slightest thing. I feel crazy. I snapped and walked away from them, and they proceeded to leave me at camp while they all went and got breakfast. I sobbed so hard for like a half an hour. I know I’m highly sensitive right now and irrational, and it makes me feel even more unstable being surrounded by a bunch of clueless men."
"I'm so easily upset right now, I can barely handle a little bit of teasing."
"It feels like everything sets me off, even the smallest thing."
"I'm just so emotional and sensitive, it's hard for me to be around people right now."
"I know I'm overreacting, but I can't help it."
"I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, afraid to say or do the wrong thing."
"I struggle to even speak to people at work, my tone is so harsh and abrupt, my face stone expressionless. I genuinely get so over everything and even work is overwhelming enough."
"I'm so drained, I can barely even talk to my coworkers, let alone do my work."
"Everything just feels so heavy, even small tasks seem like a mountain to climb."
"I'm so emotionally exhausted, I can't even muster up a smile for people."
"It's like my brain is running on fumes, I just can't seem to get myself going."
"I'm just so burnt out, I just want to crawl under a blanket and disappear."
I just went and snipped it off (very unlike me)
"I didn't want to do it, but I just went ahead and did it anyway."
"It's not something I usually do, but I felt I had to."
"That wasn't my style, but I just had to do it."
"I'm not usually so impulsive, but I decided to go for it."
"I'm normally so careful, but I just took the plunge."
I've been trying to overcome the trauma...I've developed my pmdd which is getting more and more severe.
"I'm struggling to deal with the emotional wounds from the past, and now I'm experiencing intense premenstrual symptoms that are worsening."
"The trauma has left me emotionally fragile, and my premenstrual dysphoric disorder is making it harder to function."
"My past experiences have taken a toll on my mental health, and my PMDD is making things much more difficult."
"I'm trying to heal from the trauma, but my PMDD is making it a real uphill battle."
"I'm working on getting better, but the severity of my PMDD is making it a constant challenge."
"I cannot, for some reason, get myself to do them (or much of anything else)"
"I'm just not motivated to do them, or really anything else right now."
"For some reason, I'm finding it incredibly hard to even start on those tasks."
"I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and can't seem to muster the energy to do anything, even the simple things."
"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I just don't have the desire to do them or anything else."
It's like I'm mentally checked out and can't seem to bring myself to do even the smallest tasks.
"I’ve been starting to say that I’m “floating” through life instead. Life doesn’t feel real, it doesn’t feel like I’m actually living. It’s such a weird feeling, it’s like I’m not consciously here. Maybe it’s a part of the brain fog, idk. It’s very “out of body”."
"I feel like I'm just going through the motions, like I'm not really present."
"Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching my life unfold from a distance."
"It's like I'm living in a dream, not fully connected to reality."
"I feel detached from myself, like I'm observing my own life as an outsider."
"It's like my mind is on autopilot, not fully engaged with what's happening around me."
A newer symptom for me is night sweats. I tend to get cold while resting regardless of time of the month (total crap circulation to my extremities.
Geçenlerde fark ettim ki geceleri aşırı terliyorum.
"Uyurken soğuktan uyanıyorum, hele de ayın hangi döneminde olduğum fark etmiyor, kan dolaşımım çok kötü."
Vücudumda özellikle uzuvlarımda kan dolaşımının yavaş olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Gece terlemeleri yeni başıma gelen bir şey, sanırım kan dolaşımımla ilgili."
"Daha önce hiç bu kadar terlememiştim, soğuk havalarda bile ellerim ve ayaklarım buz gibi oluyor."
I need an immediate solution to make my period end quick or stop
I'm looking for a way to make my period end sooner.
I need something to help my period go away faster.
Is there anything I can do to shorten my period?
I'm searching for a fast solution to stop my period.
I'm desperate for a way to make my period end quickly.
"I keep a backscratcher in my purse and my school backpack because it feels like my entire back, armpits, and love handle area get super super itchy around the same time every month. I beg my husband to scratch me as hard as he possibly can. It’s funny… looking back during my time at home, my mom would occasionally make me her personal back scratcher. She definitely showed signs of someone with PMDD, it could be connected."
"My back, armpits, and love handles are always so itchy during that time of the month, I keep a backscratcher in my purse and my backpack because I never know when it'll hit."
"My husband knows exactly what time of the month to grab the backscratcher because my back, armpits, and love handles get so itchy!"
"When I was a kid, my mom would make me scratch her back, so I know how much those itchy feelings suck."
I think my mom may have had PMDD because she would get so itchy around the same time every month.
"It's funny how my mom's itchiness and my own itchy back are so similar, almost like it's genetic!"
"I’ve had clinical depression and anxiety since I was a teen, so I’m worried about getting in my own way in regards to freaking out too much before anything actually happens, if anything is gonna happen at all"
"I've been struggling with mental health issues for years, and I worry I'll sabotage my own progress by overthinking and getting anxious before anything even happens."
"My anxiety and depression make me fear that I'll get in my own head and panic before anything actually goes wrong, if anything is even going to go wrong."
"I'm constantly battling with the fear that I'll let my anxiety get the best of me and freak out before anything happens, even if it's something I'm looking forward to."
"I'm so used to dealing with depression and anxiety that I worry I'll overreact and create unnecessary stress for myself, even if nothing is actually happening."
"The fear of getting overwhelmed by my anxiety is always in the back of my mind, making me hesitant to even try new things because I'm terrified of freaking out."
I have managed my constant crying and SI with meds and therapy but now I just feel apathetic. Don’t want to do anything but rot or sleep
"I've been able to control my self-harm and emotional breakdowns with medication and therapy, but now I feel completely empty and unmotivated."
"I'm finally stable after struggling with my mental health, but now I feel like I've lost all my energy and desire to do anything."
"The meds and therapy have helped me manage my suicidal thoughts and crying fits, but now I just feel numb and detached from everything."
"I've been through a lot lately, but now I just feel like I'm going through the motions and have no real interest in anything."
"I've made progress, but I feel so drained that all I want to do is sleep and forget about everything."
I’m worried that’s there’s something wrong
I'm concerned there might be a problem.
"Something feels off, and I'm worried."
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm afraid there's something amiss.
I'm uneasy because I think something's wrong.
"sometimes I’m fine for a looong time..., anytime my mental health was getting bad at work and felt like I had to quit was due to hormones. Or all the times I went out with friends and had an anxiety attack... two weeks of fun just to prepare for two weeks of mad anxiety and annoyance / despair."
"Sometimes I feel like I’m on top of the world, and then everything just crashes down."
"It's like a roller coaster of emotions, and I never know when I'm going to be on the upswing or the downswing."
It's so frustrating to feel great for a while and then have everything fall apart.
I wish I could just maintain a stable mood for more than a few days.
"It's like my mental health is a ticking time bomb, and I never know when it's going to explode."
"Every time PMDD hits, I just want to leave it all behind and start/join a village and live there self-sufficiently with a bunch of other women...I just really, really get the urge to have a lot of female companions in my luteal phase"
"During my luteal phase, I crave a strong community of women, a place where I feel supported and understood."
"I feel a deep yearning for a simple life, surrounded by nature and a close-knit community of women."
PMDD makes me fantasize about leaving everything behind and starting a new life with a supportive group of women.
"The feeling of isolation during PMDD is unbearable, I just want to be surrounded by women who understand what I'm going through."
"I think a strong female support network is essential, especially when dealing with the emotional challenges of PMDD."
HAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Bunu kesinlikle hak etmiyorum!
Bu nasıl mümkün olabilir?!
"Gerçekten mi, şimdi mi?!"
Bu kadar kötü olamaz!
"Sinirlerim bozuldu, artık dayanamıyorum!"
a lot of times it all feels like my symptoms are all in my head
"I feel like my symptoms are all in my head, even though I know they're not."
"It's so frustrating because I feel like my symptoms are all in my head, but they're real."
"Sometimes I wonder if my symptoms are all in my head, but I know I'm not imagining them."
It's hard to deal with my symptoms when it feels like they're all in my head.
"I'm starting to feel like my symptoms are all in my head, and I'm not sure what to do."
"I'm freaking out. My PMDD symptoms don't magically go away once I start bleeding, they typically last a few days into my 8-10 days of extremely heavy and painful bleeding. ... I'm scared that I will be unable to enjoy myself at all. I am scared that her family will find out what a crazy bitch I can be. I am afraid that I ruin things for everyone. I am scared of being uncomfortable while everyone is enjoying themselves and looking like a wet mop of a person. I am upset that I am going to spend this trip in physical and emotional pain that no one there would understand."
"I feel like I'm going to be miserable the whole trip, and everyone will think I'm crazy."
"I just want to enjoy myself, but I know I'm going to be in so much pain."
My PMDD is ruining this trip for me.
I'm scared I'm going to be a burden on everyone.
"I hate that my body does this to me, I just want to feel normal."
"My face looks puffy, round or chubby. My skin gets oily and shiny. I get dark circles under my eyes, acne along my jaw and neck. I feel so ugly during this time."
"My skin looks so bad, especially around my nose and forehead."
I feel so insecure when my hair is greasy and I have breakouts.
It's hard to look in the mirror when my face feels bloated and my skin feels rough.
I hate the way my face looks when I'm getting acne. My cheeks are always red and blotchy.
My pores are huge and my face looks like a shiny oil slick. I'm really self-conscious about it.
"I feel myself getting ten times more frustrated and emotional over the sexism I encounter in my every day life. Idk, I just feel so much female agony during luteal."
"I'm getting so tired of the constant sexism I face, it's like I'm on a rollercoaster of frustration and anger."
"I don't know why, but the sexism I experience makes me feel so much more emotional and frustrated, especially during my luteal phase."
"The sexism I face daily just feels so much more impactful during my luteal phase, it's like I'm extra sensitive to it."
"It's like my emotions are amplified during my luteal phase, and the sexism I encounter makes me feel ten times more frustrated."
"I'm feeling so much more emotional and frustrated these days, I think it's because of the constant sexism I'm experiencing and maybe because I'm in my luteal phase."
I feel like my body is attacking me when I come down from the peak of ovulation. Feeling suddenly nauseous and have an incoming headache.
"I'm experiencing a wave of unpleasant symptoms as I come down from the ovulation peak, feeling nauseous and a headache brewing."
"My body is rebelling against me after the ovulation surge, I'm feeling queasy and a headache is coming on."
"The sudden drop after ovulation is hitting me hard, I'm feeling nauseous and a headache is looming."
"I feel like my body is punishing me for the ovulation surge, I'm experiencing nausea and a headache is forming."
"The post-ovulation crash is making me feel awful, nausea and a headache are making their presence known."
I feel so freaking hopeless. I get lightheaded before my period. ...pukes before my period like 5 days before. ...wake up with such a high heart rate. ...feel like I'm going to pass out before my period. ...see spots when I wake up before my period. ...can't even stay awake. ...get migraines with aura and I can't see before or just after my period. ...turned my head and all of a sudden the room was moving. I just feel like I never know what's going to happen and when is what's stressing me out. Will I be puking? High HR? Low HR? Dizziness? What I'm assuming is vertigo?? Will I have another migraine where I can't see anything??
I'm constantly worried about what my body will do next.
"It's like my body is betraying me, and I have no control over it."
"I feel so out of control, and it's driving me crazy."
I just want to know what's going to happen so I can prepare for it.
I feel like I'm living in a constant state of uncertainty.
i’m tired of sleeping all the time and eating like shit and having no control over my body and mind and impulses
"I'm feeling so lost and out of control, like I'm just a passenger in my own life."
"I'm exhausted from this constant struggle, this feeling of being stuck in a rut."
"I'm desperate to break free from this cycle of self-destruction, to find some sense of order and purpose."
"This feeling of being trapped within myself, it's driving me crazy."
"I need to find a way to regain control, to reclaim my own life."
"I have ADHD/anxiety as well and struggle a lot with skin picking as a stim or anxiety relief, and when I get these hormonal acne flares I’m just trying to pop cysts that won’t pop, scratching and clawing at my skin, making me look sm worse."
"I have a hard time controlling my urge to pick at my skin, especially when I'm stressed or anxious."
"It's like I can't help but scratch and dig at my skin, even though it only makes things worse."
"I've been trying to find ways to manage my skin picking, but it's really difficult."
"The hormonal acne makes the urge to pick even stronger, and I just end up making my skin look worse."
"I wish I could just stop picking at my skin, but it's such a strong compulsion."
"a week before my period my suicidal ideation is INTENSE. Every day, multiple times a day, and only for that week, I think about how I might end it all, what I’ll say in my goodbye notes, etc."
"Her ay aynı hafta, intihar düşüncelerim çok yoğunlaşıyor."
"Adetimden bir hafta önce, her gün ve gün içinde defalarca intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşuyorum."
"Adet öncesi haftanın her gününde, intihar düşünceleri beynimi kemiriyor, ölümle nasıl yüzleşeceğimi, veda notlarımda ne yazacağımı düşünüyorum."
"Bir hafta boyunca, adetimden önce, intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşmak zorunda kalıyorum, bunu sürekli düşünüyorum, bunu nasıl yapacağımı, ne yazacağımı, hep aynı döngü."
"Adetimden bir hafta önce, intihar düşünceleri beynimi ele geçiriyor, her gün, defalarca, ölümle nasıl yüzleşeceğimi, ne diyeceğimi düşünüyorum."
"I've legit had it since I was like, 11 (though I didn't realize it wasn't normal till I was like 18 and didn't get formally diagnosed till 25)"
"I've been dealing with this for years, honestly since I was a kid."
"It's something I've struggled with for a long time, way longer than I realized."
"I remember noticing it when I was young, but it wasn't until much later that I understood it wasn't typical."
"I didn't get help until I was older, even though I knew something wasn't right for years."
"It wasn't officially diagnosed until recently, but it's something I've been living with for a long time."
my girlfriend is suffering from PMDD and anxiety...she get's very irritated throughout the day and i know it's not her fault but her hormones
"My girlfriend's PMDD symptoms are really difficult to deal with, she gets so easily upset and it's hard to remember it's not her fault."
"It's tough watching my girlfriend struggle with anxiety and PMDD, it's like a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day."
"I try to be patient with my girlfriend when she's dealing with her PMDD and anxiety, I know it's not her fault, it's her hormones."
"It's frustrating seeing my girlfriend get so irritated all the time, I know it's just her PMDD and anxiety, but it's hard not to take it personally sometimes."
"I'm doing my best to support my girlfriend through her PMDD and anxiety, it's a tough time for her, but I'm here for her."
"i was out on divalproex for my PMDD diagnosis. i feel like that doesn’t seem right... the frustration still seems to be there, but the depression and extreme anger have seemed to subside?"
"I'm still having a lot of frustration, but the depression and rage have mostly gone away since I started taking divalproex."
"It's weird how the divalproex seems to be working for the depression and anger, but I'm still feeling frustrated."
"I feel like the divalproex is helping with the depression and anger, but I'm still feeling frustrated."
"It's strange, the divalproex seems to be working for the depression and anger, but the frustration is still there."
"I'm not sure why, but the divalproex seems to be helping with the depression and anger, but the frustration is still there."
I was diagnosed and on treatment for bipolar and depression since 2011...I strongly feel that I have PMDD. He said not now bc I'm stable. However I don't believe I'm bipolar nor have I ever been. I'm just a hormonal bitch every month and need treatment for that.
"I've been on medication for bipolar disorder and depression since 2011, but I don't think that's actually what's wrong with me."
"My doctor thinks I'm bipolar, but I'm convinced it's just my hormones acting up."
"He said I'm 'stable' now, so he won't consider PMDD, but I'm not convinced that's the right diagnosis."
"I'm not bipolar, I'm just a hormonal mess every month and I need treatment for that."
"I've been told I'm bipolar for years, but I think I'm just experiencing severe PMS."
"I still get increased hunger, irritability, depression etc (feels like a 'lighter' version of PMDD) when I come to the end of my pill pack."
I feel like I'm going through a milder version of PMDD when I run out of my medication.
"Even though the symptoms are less intense, I still experience a noticeable dip in my mood and energy levels towards the end of my pill pack."
It's like my body is anticipating the change in medication and I start feeling the effects before I even run out.
"The increased hunger, irritability, and depression are subtle, but they're definitely there when I'm nearing the end of my pills."
"It's like I'm experiencing a mini-version of PMDD, but not as severe as before."
i've been so angry and sensitive ever since i got on the pill and i've just now realized its the pill. I've been blowing up or acting rude towards my boyfriend alot these past two days and i feel so bad because he just means well and i dont want to let these pills affect how i treat people. i feel like i dont have any emotion besides sadness and pure rage from these damn side effects
"I'm feeling so volatile and on edge, it's like a switch flipped inside me after starting the new medication."
"I've been snapping at everyone, even my boyfriend who's just trying to be nice, and it's all because of these side effects."
"It's like I'm constantly on the verge of tears or an explosion, and it's making me feel so awful about how I'm acting."
"I've never been this moody and irritable before, I just feel like a completely different person since I started these pills."
"The emotional rollercoaster is unbearable, I'm swinging between feeling so sad and exploding with anger, it's driving me crazy."
"I can relate to your stories and can cross off the main symptoms (extreme fatigue, needing to sleep more than usual, anger, questioning every friendship, suicidal ideation to name a few)."
"I understand exactly what you're going through, it sounds like you're experiencing some of the same things I have."
"It's tough to deal with these kinds of symptoms, I know I've felt the same way."
"The constant fatigue, the anger, the questioning of everything... it's all too familiar."
"I've been there too, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you're feeling so down."
"It's good to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, it helps to hear others have gone through similar struggles."
my sex drive is virtually non-existent and it takes so much work for me to get turned on
I'm not really interested in sex these days and it takes a lot of effort to get aroused.
My libido is pretty low and it's hard for me to get in the mood.
I'm not feeling very sexual lately and it's a struggle to get turned on.
I've lost my desire for intimacy and it takes a lot of effort to get aroused.
My sex drive is pretty much gone and it takes a lot of work to get excited.
"I find myself wishing he was normal, wishing he could do the things my other two kids can do. I find myself wishing he’d just play like a normal kid instead of playing with the garden hose for 4 hours a day. I get annoyed at him for throwing tantrums when he needs to stop a favorite activity and I get mad at him for taking things from his brothers."
"I long for the days when he was a typical child, engaging in activities that my other children enjoyed."
I yearn for him to participate in ordinary childhood games instead of fixating on the garden hose for hours on end.
It frustrates me when he throws fits when he's asked to discontinue a beloved activity.
His habit of taking belongings from his siblings drives me to anger.
I find myself wishing for the simpler days when his behavior wasn't so challenging.
I'm impulsive with food and I'll eat anything.
"I can't resist a good meal, no matter what it is."
"I have no willpower when it comes to food, I'll try anything."
"I'm a total foodie, I'll eat anything and everything."
"I don't have a picky palate, I'm open to trying anything."
"My stomach rules my mind when it comes to food, I'll eat anything."
"I'm 34 years old and was diagnosed with PMDD about a year ago. I'm finally tracking my cycle and getting myself prepared for luteal phase this month so I know when I'm going to start feeling sad, angry, irritable, and helpless. I've started taking citalopram and I think it's helping, though I don't have as many very high or very low emotions anymore..."
I'm trying to manage my PMDD symptoms by tracking my cycle and knowing what to expect during the luteal phase.
"It's been a real struggle to understand my body and how PMDD affects me, but I'm finally starting to get a handle on it."
I'm hoping the medication will help me feel more stable throughout my cycle and prevent the extreme mood swings I've been experiencing.
"It's been a long road, but I'm feeling more hopeful about managing my PMDD with the help of tracking my cycle and taking medication."
"I'm still learning about my body and what works best for me, but I'm feeling more empowered to take control of my health with this new understanding."
I feel like crying. I cried like 5 times today over stupid things and feeling like I’m a failure now I feel like i’m going to lose my mind anytime someone tries talking to me and thinking about making dinner tonight is overwhelming me.
"I'm so stressed and overwhelmed right now, I feel like I'm going to explode."
"Everything feels pointless, even the simplest tasks feel impossible."
I just want to crawl under the covers and disappear for a while.
"My brain is fried, I can't focus on anything and I feel like I'm going to cry."
"I'm exhausted from dealing with all of this, I just want to be left alone."
I literally get insomnia and like a flu feeling and fatigue
"I feel so exhausted, I can't even sleep at night."
"My body is just so drained, I feel like I'm coming down with something."
I'm so tired I'm practically running on fumes.
"I feel like I'm constantly fighting off a cold, and I just can't seem to get any rest."
"I'm so overwhelmed with stress, it's making me physically ill."
"I've spent the whole past month thinking 'ah I'm feeling severely depressed, my period must be due soon' and I feel like my whole life has been put on hold. I had so many plans, ambitions and fun projects I wanted to do and yet all I can get myself to do is eat, sleep and distract myself with my phone. Everything is overwhelming and I hateeeeee it here, I feel so hopeless and like I'm falling behind on everything :(("
"I feel like I'm stuck in this endless loop of sadness and self-doubt, and it's making it impossible to move forward with my life."
"It's like my brain is constantly telling me I'm not good enough, and it's draining all my energy and motivation."
"I just want to feel like myself again, but I'm so lost in this dark cloud of negativity that I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"I feel so disconnected from my dreams and aspirations, and it's heartbreaking to watch my own life slip away."
"I'm so tired of feeling like I'm failing at everything, and I just want to break free from this cycle of self-destruction."
"My PMDD and PMS are ongoing. My mood isn’t as horrible as usual (no suicidal ideation or anything), but all the physical symptoms are there continuously for two months."
"My PMDD symptoms have been really bad lately, especially the physical ones."
"I'm still struggling with the physical side effects of PMDD, it's been a constant struggle for the past two months."
"I feel like I'm constantly dealing with the physical symptoms of PMDD, it's exhausting."
"I'm so tired of feeling this way, I just want the physical symptoms of PMDD to go away."
"It's been two months of dealing with the physical symptoms of PMDD, I'm starting to feel hopeless."
"every 2 weeks during my luteal phase I end up breaking out into itchy hives all across my chest as well patches on my shoulders, back, and face... I’m so tired of being itchy on top of already wanting to curl up into a ball and cry in frustration and irritability."
"I'm so frustrated and irritable during my luteal phase, and the itchy hives just make it worse."
It's like my body is betraying me during this time – the hives are so uncomfortable and embarrassing.
"The itchy hives make me want to rip my skin off, and the emotional roller coaster is just adding to my misery."
"I'm exhausted from the constant itching, and I feel like I'm going crazy with frustration."
I just want to sleep through the entire luteal phase and hope the hives magically disappear.
"I feel absolutely massive today and I hate how selfish I am when I assume the first thing strangers must think when they see me is, “What an out-of-shape blob.” I recently gained 5-10lbs and I have been out-of-shape since last fall. I’m just feeling really down about myself."
I'm feeling really insecure about my weight gain and I hate how I automatically assume everyone is judging me.
I'm so self-conscious about my body today. I just feel huge and I can't shake the feeling that everyone is staring at me.
It's so frustrating feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm worried about what people think about my weight and it's really bringing me down.
I feel so fat and ugly today. I'm seriously considering just staying home and hiding from the world.
I just can't seem to get over this weight gain. I feel like I'm a completely different person and I hate it.
I try so hard to not take medication. But the emotions and the anxiety and the panic attacks are so heavy and so real and so hard. ... I feel like such a burden. ... I barely have any energy to do anything. ... I’m so scared to take a medication. ... I’ve tried taking medication before and I freaked myself out on them so bad the first couple of days that I put myself into panic modes and couldn’t wait to get them out of my system.
"I'm terrified of the side effects, but I'm also terrified of living like this."
"It's like a vicious cycle – I know medication could help, but I'm so afraid of how it might make me feel."
"I feel like I'm trapped in this body, unable to control my emotions, and I don't know what to do."
"I just want to feel normal again, but I'm so scared of taking the leap."
"I feel like I'm drowning in my own anxiety, and I'm desperate for a lifeline."
I literally use him as a emotional punching bag. It's so bad. I always feel so bad because he doesn't deserve that. Im really working on my rage episodes because I don't want to lose him.
"I'm so angry at him sometimes that I just have to let it all out, even if it hurts him."
"It's terrible, I yell at him and say things I don't mean, I know he doesn't deserve it."
"He's so patient, he just takes it, but I know I need to stop before I actually push him away."
"I need to find a healthier way to deal with my anger, because I love him and I don't want to lose him."
"I'm trying so hard to be better, I don't want to be the person who makes him unhappy."
"I experience when I get my period and wake up feeling so much better the following morning. Like WOAH, I no longer constantly feel attacked by everything?! Maybe everything will be okay and I don't need to die?? ...this huge epiphany that this isn't my fault, PMDD me is not who I really am, and HOW COULD IT NOT BE MORE OBVIOUS TO ME THIS WHOLE PAST WEEK... Like HELLLLOOOOO"
The relief I feel when my period arrives is incredible. It's like a weight has been lifted and I can finally breathe again.
It's amazing how much better I feel the morning after my period starts. It's like the fog has cleared and I can see clearly again.
The feeling of normalcy returning after my period starts is so powerful. It's like I'm finally back to myself again.
I always feel so much lighter and happier after my period starts. It's like a fresh start and a chance to reset.
"The realization that I'm not actually crazy, it's just my PMDD, is so liberating. It's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders."
I feel like my brain is on fire. All I want to do is sleep.
"I'm completely fried, I just need to shut down for a bit."
"My mind is racing, I can't even think straight. All I want is to sleep."
"I'm so exhausted, I can't focus on anything but how much I need to sleep."
"My brain feels like it's going to explode, I just need to get some rest."
"I'm mentally drained, the only thing I can think about is getting some shut-eye."
pmdd is kicking my ass so hard today and the dark thoughts won’t seem to leave. i feel hopeless
"Today, PMDD is hitting me so hard that I can't seem to shake the dark thoughts."
I'm feeling completely overwhelmed by PMDD today and the negativity just won't go away.
"The dark thoughts are consuming me today, and I feel like I can't escape this feeling of hopelessness."
"PMDD is taking a toll on me today, and the dark thoughts are making it impossible to see any light at the end of the tunnel."
"I'm battling a wave of despair today, and the dark thoughts are making me feel completely helpless."
I will become so incredibly emotional... every event that occurs gets twisted into something negative... I will become highly suspicious of him... I will take extreme offense to everything he says... I will interpret his facial expressions or tone of voice in a negative way constantly... I will always think he’s angry or upset / doesn’t love me... I cant feel like this anymore
I am constantly consumed by this negativity and doubt.
His every word and action feels like a personal attack.
My mind is flooded with irrational fears and insecurities.
I feel like I'm losing myself in this cycle of negativity.
I need to break free from this destructive pattern of thinking.
"I have suffered from PMDD since my late teens, and it’s varied from being irritable to full blown suicidal and unable to get out of bed."
"My PMDD has been a constant struggle since my late teens, with symptoms ranging from irritability to severe suicidal thoughts and debilitating fatigue."
"The impact of PMDD on my life has been immense, from experiencing mood swings to feeling completely overwhelmed and unable to function."
"Living with PMDD has been a rollercoaster of emotions, with periods of intense irritability followed by deep despair and an inability to leave my bed."
"PMDD has taken a toll on my mental and physical well-being, causing me to experience extreme mood fluctuations and leaving me feeling completely drained and hopeless."
"The symptoms of PMDD have been incredibly challenging, making me feel incredibly angry and frustrated, and at times, leading to suicidal thoughts and an inability to even get out of bed."
I haven't felt nearly as anxious or full of anger as I usually do...
I'm actually feeling a lot calmer than I normally would.
My usual anxieties and frustrations just aren't there today.
"For once, I'm not overwhelmed with worry or rage."
"I feel surprisingly peaceful and at ease, considering."
It's almost like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
"I feel like I am in a constant battle between wanting to change my behaviours/beat PMDD and learning to accept myself and the disorder. ...I entered a downwards spiral of believing that no one liked me, no one had time for me, and I was a unwanted burden on other people. I felt unseen and ugly. I began to hate myself for feeling this way and letting it get in the way of a fun trip away. ...I felt so angry! Angry at myself for not being well enough to join on the night out and have fun. Angry at PMDD! Angry at my partner for leaving me and jealous of him having fun without me! Such self-sabotage. I took out my anger on my partner who actually gives so much to support me and was utterly burnt out."
I'm struggling to balance the desire to overcome PMDD and the need to accept myself as I am.
It's a constant fight between wanting to change and wanting to accept my limitations.
I feel like I'm caught in a tug-of-war between fighting my disorder and learning to live with it.
"The need to change my behaviour clashes with the need to accept myself, and I'm stuck in the middle."
It's exhausting trying to find a balance between overcoming PMDD and accepting myself.
Girlfriend was hiding the fact that she was having a PMDD episode and was embarrassed since apparently past partners weren’t nice about it.
My girlfriend was embarrassed to tell me about her PMDD because she thought I wouldn't understand.
"She was afraid I'd react badly to her PMDD symptoms, like past partners have."
She felt ashamed to admit she was having a PMDD episode because she'd been judged for it in the past.
"She didn't want to burden me with her PMDD, so she kept it a secret."
It was hard for her to confide in me about her PMDD because she's been hurt by others' reactions.
"I have had moments before that my irritability during luteal has caused me to snap, but this was something new and I am ashamed of my lack of self control… so apologies to the poor driver of a civic at 6:00am yesterday, you were too close to my rear and being a knob, but I doubt you deserved me shouting out my window and flipping the birdie at you. Afterwards I felt like a crazy lady people post videos about. My issue now is the heavy guilt and self-bullying I thought I had escaped this month is actually happening all during menstrual week."
"I'm usually a pretty calm person, but the week before my period, I just lose it sometimes.  I know that's no excuse for how I acted, but I just feel like a completely different person during that time."
"Yesterday, I was driving to work and this guy cut me off.  I was so mad, I yelled at him and flipped him off.  I'm really embarrassed about it, and I feel terrible for making him feel bad."
"I can't believe I lost my temper like that.  It wasn't even a big deal, and I ended up making a scene.  I don't know what came over me, but I'm really disappointed in myself."
"I always feel so out of control during my period.  It's like I'm a completely different person.  I know I shouldn't let my emotions get the best of me, but it's so hard sometimes."
"I'm really struggling with the guilt and shame I'm feeling after yesterday's incident.  I know I shouldn't be so hard on myself, but I just feel like a terrible person."
I have been extremely anxious and suicide ideation
"I've been feeling really down lately, and I've even had thoughts about hurting myself."
"The anxiety has been so bad, I've been thinking about ending it all."
I feel like I'm trapped in a dark place and I can't see a way out.
My mind is racing with negative thoughts and I'm overwhelmed with sadness.
I'm struggling to cope and I feel like I'm losing control.
I can get stuck on one particular thing sometimes... During my last Luther phase someone suggested that I am a bad parent... But it got stuck in my head really bad after I heard what they said to the point I wanted to leave my family or die because I thought I was such a bad mom. And other intrusive thoughts crept in...
Sometimes I get so fixated on something that it consumes me entirely.
"I remember one time when I was really into listening to a certain band, someone said I was neglecting my responsibilities. "
"It's strange how a single comment can have such a powerful impact, especially when it's something negative."
That one comment really got to me and I started to question everything about myself.
"Those negative thoughts kept coming back, making it hard to focus on anything else."
I began with PMDD basically as soon as my second was born but was diagnosed a year and a half ago. I'm so exhausted every day I can barely care for myself let alone my kids.
"I've been struggling with PMDD since my second child was born, but it took over a year for me to get a diagnosis."
It's been so hard managing PMDD and taking care of my kids. I'm constantly exhausted.
"The exhaustion from PMDD is overwhelming. I feel like I can barely function, let alone be the mom I want to be."
"Since my diagnosis, I've been trying to learn how to cope with PMDD and manage my energy levels."
"I feel like I'm in a constant state of fatigue. It's hard to do anything, even the simplest things."
i feel as if it has made my pmdd symptoms come on early (i’m day 14/26 right now) and it feels a lot worse
"I feel like this has triggered my PMDD symptoms, and they're a lot more intense this time."
"This has definitely brought on my PMDD symptoms early, and I'm already feeling so much worse."
"It feels like this has made my PMDD symptoms hit me earlier than usual, and they're really bad this time."
"I'm convinced this has triggered my PMDD early, and it's way worse than usual."
"I'm feeling the effects of this, and my PMDD symptoms are way more intense than they usually are."
"I had a panic attack, depressed, super bad anxiety all the time, complete loss of appetite, tension all the time, throwing up, bad intrusive thoughts, constant crying, and depression. ...anxious thoughts, feeling hopeless, passively suicidal, afraid that I was seriously going crazy, constant crying, and again complete loss of appetite and troubles sleeping along with throwing up. ...my anxiety has spiked and I’m starting to feel the way that I did before... my body is still very anxious and My appetite is completely lost."
"I've been feeling overwhelmed, like I'm drowning in a sea of anxiety and sadness."
"It's a constant struggle to cope with the racing thoughts, the emptiness inside, and the fear that grips my heart."
"My mind is a battlefield, bombarded with intrusive thoughts and worries that never seem to end."
"The weight of despair is heavy on my shoulders, and it feels like I'm slowly slipping away."
"I'm exhausted, both physically and mentally, and the thought of facing another day feels like an insurmountable task."
"I often feel very down, especially without my meds in me but I can’t seem to tell the difference."
"I feel a lot better when I'm on my meds, but I don't always know if it's the medication or just me feeling better naturally."
It's hard to tell if I'm truly feeling better or if it's just the meds working their magic.
I'm not sure if I'm actually improving or if it's just the medication making me feel less down.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm just existing, even when I'm on my meds."
"I'm hoping that one day I'll feel better without needing my meds, but it's hard to tell right now."
"The week before my period, sometimes up to 10 days.... just straight constant suicidal thoughts."
"My premenstrual period is brutal, I'm talking constant suicidal thoughts for up to 10 days."
The week leading up to my period is just awful. All I can think about is ending it all.
"I hate that week before my period, it's like a constant battle against my own mind, filled with suicidal thoughts."
"It's like a dark cloud hangs over me for the 10 days before my period, the suicidal thoughts are unrelenting."
"I can't function properly during that week before my period, the suicidal thoughts are just too intense."
"I looked in the mirror this morning and swore my face wasn't mine. The body dysmorphia is beyond dysmorphia at this point. My face looked like a stranger, but yesterday looked so much like mine. This happens every month when my PMDD is bad or when my period is RIGHT about to come. I HATE this part of PMDD. It feels like nothing I do looks right or good, nothing looks or feels like me."
"My reflection felt so alien, like a stranger staring back at me. It's like my body betrays me, especially when the PMDD hits hard."
"This isn't just body dysmorphia, it's a full-blown identity crisis. One minute I recognize myself, the next I'm staring at a complete stranger."
"My face feels like a mask, a borrowed shell that doesn't belong to me. It's the worst part of my cycle, this feeling of disassociation from my own body."
"It's like my body is playing tricks on me, warping my perception of myself. I feel so detached from my own reflection, it's terrifying."
"I look in the mirror and don't recognize the person staring back. The PMDD makes me feel like I'm trapped in someone else's body, someone I don't know."
"Every 2 weeks, my body goes into constant fight or flight mode and there’s always a pit in my stomach. The adrenaline/cortisol levels are too high and I cannot relax no matter what I do."
I struggle with major sensory overload and extreme meltdowns pre period. & s ideation and depression.
"My pre-period symptoms are really intense, with sensory overload, meltdowns, and suicidal thoughts and depression."
"The week before my period, I experience debilitating sensory overload, emotional breakdowns, and dark thoughts."
"I'm always struggling with the intense physical and emotional changes before my period, including extreme sensory sensitivity, meltdowns, suicidal thoughts, and depression."
"The hormonal shifts leading up to my period trigger a cascade of symptoms like sensory overload, meltdowns, and deep depression."
"My pre-period symptoms are a real struggle, with overwhelming sensory input, emotional breakdowns, and thoughts of self-harm."
"I had a little over a week of pms symptoms (heavy period, migraines, mood swings) ... I felt amazing. Like the first time I’ve had peace. I felt like I could do anything. ... I’ve been super anxious and depressed for 3 days now."
"I was really suffering from PMS symptoms, but once they passed I felt like a new person!"
"It was so rough with the PMS symptoms, but finally feeling back to myself is such a relief."
"The PMS was really dragging me down, but now I feel like I can conquer anything!"
"Those PMS symptoms were brutal, but now I'm feeling energized and optimistic."
"I was feeling so bad from the PMS, but now I feel like I can do anything and everything!"
"i personally am at my worse 2 days before my period, the first two days of my period and then 5 days after"
"My body goes haywire for a whole week around my period, it's brutal."
I feel absolutely awful for a solid week leading up to and following my period.
"I'm basically a zombie for the week surrounding my period, it's the worst."
"It's like a whole week of misery every month, thanks to my period."
"I'm usually in a pretty bad mood for the week around my period, it's just how it is."
I feel how I look and it makes how I feel about ten times worse.
"I hate how I look, and it makes me feel awful."
The way I look makes me feel so much worse about myself.
"My appearance makes me feel terrible, and it just amplifies my negative feelings."
"I can't stand how I look, and it just makes me feel ten times more depressed."
My self-image is so bad that it just makes me feel even worse.
"My family makes me feel awful about myself, saying I'm making up PMDD and it's all in my mind. They don't believe me, even with online links and videos. They're emotionally and physically abusive, and my sister is a bully, making me feel terrible about myself. I feel stuck and want to break all ties with them."
"My family constantly belittles me, telling me I'm exaggerating or making up my medical issues. They refuse to acknowledge my pain and suffering, despite evidence and support from professionals. It's emotionally draining and I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them."
I'm exhausted from trying to prove myself to my family. They dismiss my experiences and make me feel like I'm the problem. Their constant criticism and lack of support have left me feeling hopeless and alone.
"I've been trying to communicate my struggles to my family, but they just shut me down and refuse to listen. They say I'm being dramatic and make me feel like I'm not worthy of their attention or support."
My family's lack of empathy and understanding has created a toxic environment where I feel constantly judged and invalidated. They're quick to blame me for everything and their behavior has caused deep emotional scars.
I'm starting to realize that my family's negativity and disrespect are taking a toll on my mental health. I need to prioritize my well-being and create boundaries to protect myself from their toxic influence.
Yaz killed sex drive and made me extremely depressed and angry (plus I gained so much weight) Slynd made me so impatient and get so annoyed with my boyfriend (even his SMELL changed)
Yaz made me feel terrible and angry and I gained so much weight
Slynd made me feel so impatient and irritable and even my boyfriend's smell bothered me
I hated how Yaz made me feel and it made my relationship so difficult
I felt like I couldn't stand my boyfriend while I was on Slynd
Yaz and Slynd both had terrible side effects and made me so unhappy.
I want to tell pretty much everyone to fuck off.
"I'm so fed up with everyone, I just want them to leave me alone."
"I'm really over people right now, I just want to be left in peace."
"Everyone is getting on my nerves, I'm ready to just tell them to go away."
"I'm so frustrated, I just want to scream at everyone and tell them to leave me alone."
"I'm at my breaking point, I'm done with people and I just want to be by myself."
I was severely depressed and had a plethora of negative symptoms. And during my period I couldn't move because my cramps were so bad and my body hurt. I only had a week out of every month where I felt semi-normal.
"I felt like a prisoner in my own body, trapped by the pain and exhaustion."
The pain was so intense that even the simplest tasks felt impossible.
"There were times I wished I could just disappear, the pain was unbearable."
"It was a constant struggle to function, the depression and physical pain were overwhelming."
"My body felt like a battlefield, ravaged by pain and weakness."
"I’ve been feeling like I want to quit everything in my life... I’ve been crying all weekend, I’ve been so extremely anxious to go to work tomorrow. I’m just exhausted, and I feel like a horrible person to my two year old and husband, like I can’t be fully present for them. I’m just losing hope in life, like I’ll never have the dreams or desires I am trying to be positive for. I feel so fucking trapped and hopeless "
"I feel like I'm drowning in my own life, with no way out."
"It's like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, and I'm just barely holding on."
"Everything feels so pointless, and I'm just going through the motions."
"I feel like I'm failing everyone, including myself."
"I just want to escape, but I don't know where to go or what to do."
"I’ve turned into a vacuum sucking up everything and anything in sight!!! ... I swear I feel like my stomach’s a black hole ... random panic attacks, incomplete sleep, irritability & the urge to jump off a bridge."
"I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of chaos, and I can't seem to catch my breath."
"My mind is racing, and my body is exhausted, but I can't seem to shut it off."
"Everything feels overwhelming, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing control."
"I'm so stressed that I can barely function, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I don't get some help."
"I'm at my wit's end, and I don't know what to do anymore."
I'm normally a very determined and optimistic person but my PMDD just flips that all on its head- I abhor who I become when my illness hits.
"My PMDD makes me feel like a completely different person, someone I don't even recognize."
"The contrast between my usual self and my PMDD self is startling, it's like two completely different people."
"I hate the way my PMDD makes me feel, it's like a completely different person is in control."
"I feel like I'm losing myself when my PMDD hits, I don't even feel like myself."
"My PMDD completely turns my personality on its head, it's like a switch flips and I become someone else."
I would think at times om how the next day is near and that would activate my anxiety/impending doom. It's as if I'm scared of the next day lol.
"I get this feeling of dread knowing that another day is about to start, and it makes me anxious."
The thought of what tomorrow might bring always fills me with a sense of unease and fear.
"Sometimes, I just feel this overwhelming anxiety about the future, like something bad is going to happen."
"It's like I'm scared of what's to come, and it makes me worry about even the next day."
"The approaching future often triggers my anxiety, and it feels like I'm anticipating something terrible."
"- Oversensitive to smells, noises, light. Any change in my environment that I don't like and normally wouldn't care about sends me into a sobbing fit and I can't calm myself down. - Freaking out at any social interaction. Like becoming frustrated with the person I'm talking to immediately and just crying right off the bat. It's almost like I'm angry that I have to interact with them even though I chose to. -Fits of feeling worthless/useless and really insecure. I had body dysmorphia regardless of PMDD, but it gets really scary around my period. Like I am genuinely terrified of how much I hate myself."
"I'm overwhelmed by the simplest things, like a sudden change in temperature or a loud noise. It feels like my body is going haywire and I just can't stop crying."
Social interactions are a huge struggle. I feel like I'm losing control and just want to run away. It's exhausting.
My self-esteem plummets during this time. I start to pick apart everything about myself and feel like I'm not good enough. It's a constant battle.
It's like my body is betraying me. One minute I'm fine and the next I'm a mess of emotions. I don't understand what's happening to me.
"I wish people understood how real this is. It's not just being moody, it's a physical and emotional rollercoaster that I can't control."
"i get closer and closer to actually doing it, planning events with friends knowing it’s the last time ill see them or writing 50 page notes"
"I find myself getting closer to doing it, knowing it's the last time, even if it's just a small thing like planning a dinner with friends or writing down my thoughts."
"The idea of it being the last time makes me want to do it, no matter how big or small the task is, whether it's planning an event with friends or writing a long note."
"I feel compelled to act, to do something, to make the most of every moment, even if it's just a small act like planning an event with friends or writing down my thoughts."
"Knowing it's the last time pushes me to do things I wouldn't normally do, like writing 50 page notes or planning events with friends."
"I feel the urge to do everything I can, to make the most of this moment, even if it's just planning a small event with friends or writing down my thoughts."
"I felt really tired, but I took a nap and then it somehow got away. I also felt really cold sometimes and really hot at other times. ... I started feeling quite clear-minded, and this feeling is still with me this morning. I feel like the PMDD fog is gone."
"I was really struggling with the PMDD symptoms, but after a nap, I felt so much better. It's like a fog lifted."
"The exhaustion was overwhelming, but a short nap helped me feel refreshed. It's like the PMDD fog finally cleared."
"The temperature fluctuations were making me feel miserable, but after a nap, I felt so much clearer. I think the PMDD fog is gone."
"I was experiencing intense mood swings, but after a nap, I felt like myself again. It's like the PMDD fog is finally lifting."
"I couldn't focus at all, but after a nap, I felt like my mind was clear. I think the PMDD fog is gone."
I find that during the day I’m not too bad but my anxiety gets to 100 at night and severely impacts my sleep 😫
"My anxiety is manageable during the day, but it skyrockets at night, making it nearly impossible to sleep."
"I'm able to cope with my anxiety during the day, but as soon as night falls, it completely takes over and ruins my sleep."
"My anxiety levels are relatively low during the day, but they spike at night, leaving me tossing and turning all night."
"I feel fine most of the day, but my anxiety always hits its peak at night, making it impossible to get any rest."
"During the day, my anxiety is manageable, but come nighttime, it becomes overwhelming and wreaks havoc on my sleep."
I was still anxious about the upcoming 'werewolf week'. Well my period arrived tonight completely unexpectedly as I've had no mood/emotional symptoms.
"I was so worried about 'werewolf week' coming, but then my period came totally out of the blue, no PMS symptoms at all."
"I was freaking out about the possibility of getting my period during 'werewolf week', but thankfully it came tonight, without any of the usual mood swings."
"I was stressing about 'werewolf week' and how my period might coincide with it, but I guess it had other plans because it arrived completely unexpectedly tonight."
"I've been on edge about 'werewolf week' for days, but thankfully my period surprised me tonight and arrived without any of the usual hormonal drama."
"I was bracing myself for a rough 'werewolf week' with my period, but it decided to show up tonight completely out of nowhere, without any warning signs."
"I've been noticing the past few months that my symptoms carry through my luteal, period, and most of my follicular phase... my symptoms always die down around the ovulation window and get extremely unbearable around the middle of the luteal phase."
"My body feels completely out of whack during most of my cycle, with symptoms lingering from my luteal phase all the way through my follicular phase."
"I experience a noticeable improvement in my symptoms around ovulation, but they worsen significantly in the middle of the luteal phase."
"It seems like my symptoms are most severe during the second half of my cycle, particularly during the luteal phase."
"My symptoms tend to be manageable during the follicular phase and around ovulation, but they become much worse during the luteal phase."
"I've been tracking my symptoms closely and have noticed a clear pattern - they're generally better during the follicular and ovulation phases, but much worse during the luteal phase."
I am constantly so focused on managing or preparing to manage my symptoms that it's like I don't fully see myself as a person anymore. I haven't noticed the way I look or the way my clothes fit or the way my hair lies on my shoulders for a long time-- I'm too busy trying to stay alive.
"My life is consumed by managing my symptoms, I feel like I've lost sight of who I am."
Being constantly preoccupied with my health has made me forget about basic things like my appearance.
"I'm so focused on surviving that I've stopped noticing the little things, like how my clothes fit or how my hair looks."
"My days are filled with managing my symptoms, I feel like I've forgotten what it's like to simply exist."
"I'm so caught up in my illness that I've lost touch with myself, my body, and my identity."
‘Progesterone drunk’ is an experience - I didn’t realize food doubles the strength.
"I've been feeling so progesterone-drunk lately, and it's even worse after I eat."
It's crazy how food seems to amplify the effects of progesterone.
I didn't know that eating could make the progesterone-drunk feeling so much stronger.
"I've been feeling super emotional and bloated, it's definitely the progesterone."
I'm starting to think that progesterone is the reason I've been craving everything in sight.
"Always fighting with family, boyfriend, panic attacks, depression, etc. I would isolate myself and never socialize with people."
"I was constantly battling with inner demons and external conflicts, leading to a deep sense of isolation."
"The constant negativity in my life, both personal and internal, pushed me further and further away from others."
"Feeling overwhelmed by family drama, relationship problems, and my own mental health struggles, I withdrew from social interaction."
"The constant struggle with my family, my boyfriend, and my own mental health made it impossible for me to connect with anyone."
"It felt like I was always fighting a losing battle, and the only escape was to isolate myself and avoid any contact with the outside world."
"after two years of pretty solid relief from my worst PMDD symptoms (severe depressive thoughts), my medication seems to be losing its efficacy for me"
"After two years of feeling much better, my medication is starting to lose its effectiveness again."
"My medication has been working well for a while, but now it seems like it's not helping as much."
"I've been feeling so much better, but lately my PMDD symptoms are coming back and I'm worried my meds aren't working anymore."
"I've been on this medication for two years and it's been great, but I'm noticing it's not working as well as it used to."
"My PMDD symptoms were so bad, but this medication really helped. Now, I feel like it's not doing as much."
"I thought I was going absolutely mad... I am feeling panic... I don't look like myself and it's jarring and scary. I feel like my skin turns this grayish color, it swells, and my under eyes look like I haven't slept in 3 months. My smile looks fake... it's terrible :("
"I'm terrified, I feel like I'm losing control of my body, it's like I'm not even myself anymore."
"I don't recognize myself in the mirror, it's like I'm looking at a stranger."
"My heart is pounding, I can't catch my breath, I feel like I'm going to faint."
"I feel so vulnerable, like I'm going to break down at any moment."
"This feeling of dread is overwhelming, I don't know what to do."
I've had PMDD for about 5 years and went in today to the gyno clinic to get officially diagnosed so I can get accommodations at work for hell week (and also to consult about severe ovulation pain i have every month). I'm severely disappointed at the nurse practioner I had.
I'm so frustrated with the lack of understanding and support I've encountered regarding my PMDD.
It's disheartening to experience such a lack of knowledge and empathy from medical professionals about a condition that significantly impacts my life.
"I was hoping for more compassion and guidance from the nurse practitioner, but I felt dismissed and unheard."
The experience has left me feeling discouraged and uncertain about finding the right treatment for my PMDD.
It's incredibly frustrating to face barriers and judgment when trying to get the help and accommodations I need for my condition.
I have a COMPLETE LACK OF SELF CONTROL when it comes to buying things. Every random thought I have turns into something I look up online and put in a cart. Many of the (random) things I don’t need actually get purchased and I do NOT have the money.
"I have absolutely zero impulse control, especially when I'm shopping. Every passing thought leads me to an online purchase, and I end up with a cart full of things I didn't need."
"My self-control goes out the window the second I see something I want. It's like a reflex - I have to add it to my cart, even if I know I can't afford it."
"Shopping is my weakness, I have no willpower whatsoever. Every fleeting thought becomes a product I research and buy, even if I don't really need it."
"I have a serious problem with spending money. My brain doesn't stop me from buying things, even though I know I can't afford them."
"I'm terrible with money, I'm constantly buying things I don't need. It's like I can't help myself, I just have to buy it."
"I started noticing more posts about PMDD. I also noticed that its no longer just 'hell week' for a lot of us, and a lot of us are getting sick around ovulation and towards the end of our periods too."
"I'm seeing more and more people talking about PMDD online, and it's not just the week before our periods that's difficult anymore. A lot of us are struggling around ovulation and at the end of our cycles too."
"It seems like there's a growing awareness of PMDD, and it's clear that it's not just a few days of intense emotions. A lot of women experience symptoms throughout their cycle, especially around ovulation and during their periods."
"The amount of content about PMDD online is increasing, and it's becoming clear that the symptoms don't just affect us for a few days before our periods.  Many of us struggle with intense symptoms during ovulation and the last few days of our cycles."
"I'm starting to realize that PMDD is more common than I thought, and it's not just about 'hell week' for everyone. A lot of us are dealing with intense symptoms during ovulation and our periods as well."
"The online conversations about PMDD are growing, and it's becoming clear that it's not just about 'hell week' for a lot of women. The symptoms can be severe during ovulation and the end of our periods too."
"I’m Audhd and already deal with a lot of sensory issues and emotional dysregulation. ...I also struggle greatly with food and eating (I have Arfid) and when I’m stressed or feel any bit of unwell, I simply cannot eat. ...I only just started experiencing pmdd last September, but I feel like it’s exacerbating my other issues & it’s making things like ideation much worse and harder to ignore and my meltdowns more aggressive/violent, frequent and harder to control."
"My existing challenges with sensory overload and emotional regulation are amplified by PMDD, making it even harder to cope with daily life."
"Since starting to experience PMDD, my food sensitivities and emotional dysregulation have become even more intense and difficult to manage."
"PMDD seems to be making my existing issues with anxiety and impulsivity significantly worse, leading to more frequent and intense emotional outbursts."
"The combination of PMDD and my existing food and emotional issues is overwhelming, making it hard to function on a daily basis."
"I feel like PMDD is pushing me to my breaking point, making it incredibly difficult to manage my pre-existing sensory and emotional sensitivities."

"I was relieved to finally get a diagnosis of PMDD, rather than bipolar disorder, after seeing how well intermittent SSRI dosing worked for me."
"The diagnosis of PMDD, rather than bipolar disorder, made sense after seeing how successful intermittent SSRI dosing was for me."
"It became clear that I had PMDD, not bipolar disorder, after I saw how well intermittent SSRI dosing was working."

"intense pain, nausea, chills, fatigue and dizziness... I feel like I’m going to faint, all my limbs feel like they’re going numb and I get a rush over me of heat then the world goes a bit dark for a fraction of a second."
"I feel so weak and dizzy, my vision is blurring, and I'm starting to feel a wave of nausea."
"My head is pounding, my body feels heavy, and I can barely stand up, it feels like I'm going to collapse."
"My stomach is churning, my legs feel like jelly, and I'm having trouble seeing clearly, this feels like a bad episode."

"experiencing basically the full spectrum of PMDD physical symptoms (disruptive fatigue, ravenous all the time, acne, brain fog)"
"I'm dealing with every single awful physical symptom of PMDD – I'm constantly exhausted, starving, breaking out, and can't even think straight."
"The PMDD symptoms are hitting me hard right now – I'm so tired, I can't stop eating, my skin is awful, and my brain feels like mush."
"I feel like I'm experiencing the complete PMDD physical symptom package: crushing fatigue, constant hunger, acne, and brain fog."
"It's like every single PMDD physical symptom is attacking me at once - I'm drained, ravenous, my face is breaking out, and I can't focus at all."
"This PMDD is brutal, I'm exhausted beyond belief, I'm starving all the time, my skin is a mess, and my brain feels like it's in a fog."
"Two weeks before my period, I get the worst mood swings that are typically not normal. I have major crying spells, I lose interest in my normal activities, get angry at the drop of a hat... I'm on day 3 of my period, and mood wise I feel down in the dumps. I'm overthinking a job interview I had, I am feeling unmotivated at work, and I just want to be left alone. I have the urge to cry but I don't want to. I feel that I am in a much better place mentally now being on medication, but it still is hard to cope with these negative feelings. I feel a combination of not looking forward to doing things, being very 'run down', and just overall blah."
My hormones are really messing with me right now. I'm so emotional and I feel like I can't control it.
I'm struggling with the emotional rollercoaster of my period. I feel like I'm on a totally different planet.
"It's like my brain is playing tricks on me. I'm feeling everything so intensely, both good and bad."
I'm so exhausted from all the emotional ups and downs. I just want to curl up in bed and disappear.
"I know I'm not alone in this, but it's so hard to deal with these extreme mood swings. I feel like I'm losing my mind."
I HAVE SOME DISORDER THAT MAKES ME WANT TO JUST LAY DOWN AND CRY ALL THE FUCKING TIME
"I'm so exhausted and overwhelmed, I just want to curl up and disappear."
This constant feeling of hopelessness makes me want to shut down and hide from the world.
There's this invisible force that's pushing me down and making me want to break down.
"Everything feels so heavy and pointless, all I can do is just lay here and cry."
"I'm so tired of fighting this, I just want to give up and let the tears flow."
I am angry and sad and it's the middle of the night and I don't want to fight with my partner
"I feel so overwhelmed right now, I just want to be alone."
"It's not fair, I'm exhausted and I just want to go to sleep."
"I'm trying my best to stay calm, but I don't know how much longer I can hold it in."
I don't understand why we always end up arguing like this.
I feel like I'm always the one who has to apologize first.
"The day I started bleeding I started experiencing panic attacks. I went to the ER and got prescribed hydroxyzine. I still had panic attacks, couldn't eat, sleep, shower I just couldn't function. My period lasted around 10 days and I was experiencing debilitating anxiety. After my period ended, I felt pretty good but that only lasted like a week because now i'm bleeding again and the panic attacks have started up again. I've also lost like 12 pounds due to the inability to eat and stuff."
"The anxiety and panic attacks started when my period began, and it's been a terrible cycle ever since."
"I've been in a constant state of panic and anxiety since my period started, it's affecting my sleep, appetite, and ability to function."
"It's been a nightmare, the panic attacks started with my period and haven't stopped, I can barely eat or sleep, I'm losing weight."
"The anxiety and panic attacks started when my period began, and even though I went to the ER and got medication, it hasn't helped much."
"I'm stuck in this horrible cycle of panic attacks and anxiety, it all started with my period and it's been a struggle ever since."
"I feel frustrated & miserable nonstop. I just want to hide from any responsibility. ...I become convinced my husband hates me (for no reason) & I avoid him. ...Can't stop comparing myself to every woman I see. Crying over my stomach not being as flat as it was when I was 16. Hating myself ...I am just a depressed, insecure shell of a person. I just want to lay in a dark room alone and scroll stupid reels so I don't have to think or feel anything."
"I'm drowning in self-doubt and negativity, I just want to escape from everything."
"I feel so lost and alone, like I'm constantly failing at being happy."
"It feels like I'm stuck in a loop of negative thoughts and emotions, I can't seem to break free."
"I just want to disappear, to be invisible, to not feel this constant pain."
"My mind is a battlefield of insecurities and anxieties, it's exhausting to keep fighting."
I got so tearful and angry... its day 16 in my cycle and you best believe that means our good old friend pmdd is back
"I'm feeling so emotional and irritable, it's that time of the month again."
"Ugh, my hormones are going crazy and I'm on edge. It's day 16 of my cycle, so PMDD is back in full force."
"I'm struggling with intense emotions and mood swings, it's like my body is a ticking time bomb."
"I can feel the PMDD coming on, my patience is wearing thin, and I'm ready to burst."
"I'm just trying to get through this week, but the emotional rollercoaster is back in full swing. It's my cycle, and with it comes PMDD."
"I have repeatedly asked myself why anyone would ever hire someone with my experience or what good I could possibly do for anyone, anywhere. I have been struggling with focusing on reviewing the typical interview questions to get myself in the right headspace because the answers that come to me all basically equate to 'I suck. The end.'"
"I'm constantly battling this feeling that my experience doesn't matter, that I'm just not good enough to contribute in any meaningful way."
It's hard to prepare for interviews when the only honest answers I can think of are self-deprecating and pessimistic.
"I'm stuck in this loop of questioning my own value, wondering if anyone would ever see the worth in what I have to offer."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling a negative self-image, telling myself that I'm not worthy of the opportunities I'm pursuing."
"Every time I sit down to practice interview questions, all I can think about are my flaws and how I'm ultimately not qualified."
I want to afford to wear clothes that don’t make me feel ugly. I want to afford to buy one small thing online on a bad day to make myself feel better.
I want to be able to buy clothes that make me feel good about myself.
I want to be able to treat myself to something nice without feeling guilty.
I want to be able to afford to buy things that make me happy.
I want to have the financial freedom to buy things that make me feel good.
I want to be able to purchase things that boost my confidence and make me feel better about myself.
I also don't groom myself for example brush my hair or dress/want to look good at all. I'm not as self aware about my hygiene and my laundry feels like it's a task that would bury me alive.
"I'm not really into taking care of myself, like showering or putting on nice clothes. It just doesn't feel important to me."
I'm pretty clueless about my hygiene and keeping up with my laundry feels like a huge burden.
I guess you could say I'm not very concerned with my appearance. I rarely brush my hair and I don't really care about looking good.
I'm not the type of person who takes pride in their appearance.  Doing laundry feels like an impossible chore.
"I don't have the energy to put into grooming myself. I just don't care about looking presentable, and laundry is something I'd rather avoid."
"being in the throws of it, I found it offensive and cried"
"I was deeply affected by it and felt hurt, so I cried."
"It really upset me, I couldn't hold back the tears."
I was so overwhelmed by the situation that I found it offensive and couldn't help but cry.
I was caught up in the moment and felt so strongly about it that I cried.
The situation was so upsetting that it made me cry.
"I'm stuck on what could be a good job option to cater to my pmdd. I am so anxious and always have doubt that anything I want to do, my pmdd will get in the way one way or another... I have no energy brain fog, no desire and so on."
I feel like I'm in a rut trying to find a job that works with my PMDD. It's so frustrating knowing that my symptoms could always get in the way.
I'm exhausted trying to figure out a career path that will accommodate my PMDD. I constantly worry about the impact it could have on my ability to succeed.
The thought of job searching makes me anxious. I'm worried that my PMDD will make it impossible for me to find a job I actually enjoy.
I'm struggling to find a job that I can manage with my PMDD. The lack of energy and brain fog makes it really hard to focus and be productive.
I'm feeling overwhelmed by the job search. I'm constantly battling with self-doubt and the fear that my PMDD will hold me back.
I have been trying to get help for years.... My doctor doesn't give a fuck. ...haven't fucking gotten any so what's the fucking point.
"I've been reaching out for help for so long, but it's like nobody cares."
It's been years of struggling and nobody seems to give a damn.
"I'm at my wit's end, I've tried everything and I'm getting nowhere."
"I'm completely exhausted from trying to get help, it's like banging my head against a wall."
"I feel hopeless, it's like nobody even wants to try to understand."
"I am TERRIFIED of the next 7-10 days. I cause so many problems in my relationship during my luteal phase, and I’m worried this is going to be a bad one."
"I feel like a ticking time bomb, waiting for my luteal phase to hit so I can start making a mess of things."
I'm bracing myself for the emotional rollercoaster that's about to begin with my luteal phase.
I'm so anxious about the next week because I know I'm going to be super sensitive and likely say things I don't mean.
"My partner knows to tread lightly during my luteal phase, but I worry that this time might be even worse."
I'm dreading the next few days because I have a history of saying and doing things I regret during my luteal phase.
"I do tend to go straight to, 'well, fuck me, I'm trying like my damn life depends on it, and because I didn't move the car forward enough now you hate me, too'. ... I really jump to- I'm bad, hated, evil, wrong. ... I struggle to change. ... I feel like I fail. ... I'm constantly trying to not offend people or be bad. But I seem to offend and behave in a way that people don't like frequently. ... I isolate as my main PMDD coping mechanism. ... I do get shame for saying no, guilt for not being fun and useful, but at the end of the day it feels better than the alternative."
"I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells, constantly afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing."
"I'm always striving for perfection, but it feels like I'm never good enough."
I have a really hard time accepting that I'm not responsible for everyone else's happiness.
"It feels like I'm constantly battling with my own demons, trying to keep them at bay."
I'm so used to apologizing for everything that it feels like I've lost my voice.
I'm sick of me lashing out and yelling and all the problems during pmdd
I'm so tired of getting angry and upset during my period.
It's frustrating to lose control and yell during PMDD.
I feel like I'm constantly on edge and snapping at everyone during those days.
I wish I could just be myself and not have to deal with all these emotional ups and downs.
It feels like I'm a completely different person during my period.
"I feel like giving up. I'm back to fighting with my partner again, it's hard."
I'm so tired of this constant arguing. I just want to walk away.
This is exhausting. I don't think I can keep doing this.
"It's like we're stuck in a cycle, and I don't know how to break free."
"Every time we try to resolve something, it ends up worse than before."
"I feel like I'm losing myself in this relationship, and it's making me really unhappy."
I have to call in sick so much because of this. Each month call in at least 4 days because of it.
This thing is making me call in sick so often. I've already missed four days this month because of it.
I can't seem to shake this thing. I've had to call in sick at least four days each month because of it.
This is really starting to impact my work. I've been calling in sick at least four days a month because of it.
I'm so tired of feeling this way. I've had to call in sick at least four days this month because of it.
This is just never going to end. I've already called in sick at least four days this month because of it.
sound sensitivity really bad
My ears are really sensitive to sound.
I'm super sensitive to noise.
I have a really low tolerance for loud sounds.
I'm really bothered by even the slightest sounds.
My sound sensitivity is making it hard to concentrate.
he feels like nothing he does makes me happy
"He feels like he's just going through the motions, and nothing he does seems to matter to me."
"He's trying so hard, but it just feels like nothing he does is enough for me."
"He's putting in all this effort, but it doesn't seem like anything he does makes me happy."
"He feels like he's constantly failing to please me, no matter what he does."
He's lost his confidence because he feels like nothing he does makes me happy anymore.
"i feel ugly, my skin looks horrible, i feel bloated, my stomach hurts, i have no energy."
"I'm feeling really self-conscious today, nothing seems to be going right."
"I just feel completely out of sorts, like my body is working against me."
"I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, everything just feels wrong."
"Everything hurts, my head, my stomach, even my skin feels awful."
"I feel exhausted and drained, like I could sleep for a week."
"I no longer battle with myself, no constant worry about scheduling my life around horrific periods and PMDD episodes. I get up in the morning and just...exist. honestly, its kind of wild. Post op, i experienced about a month long 'high'. Euphoria around the immediate change in my brain - not only was i not experiencing PMDD, but my daily anxiety went from a normal 6/10 to a 0-2/10. this was completely unexpected & im constantly surprised at my increased capacity for life. I have had disabling anxiety since i was a teen - its now minor, appropriate and (mostly) manageable. This means i can now focus on healing the trauma i carry instead of constantly adding to it. its crazy how different it is."
"I used to be so consumed by my PMDD and anxiety, but now I feel like I can actually live my life without that constant weight on my shoulders."
"It's incredible how much my brain has changed since surgery. I used to be so anxious all the time, and now it's almost completely gone. I feel like a new person!"
"The relief I feel now is indescribable. I don't have to worry about my PMDD anymore, and I can finally start to address the trauma I've been carrying around for so long."
"Before the surgery, I couldn't imagine a life without constant anxiety and PMDD. Now, I can focus on myself and my healing without those debilitating symptoms."
"It's amazing how much a small change can make such a huge difference in my life. I'm finally free from the debilitating effects of PMDD and anxiety, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds."
"I'm on like my 4th day this month of bawling my eyes out, panic attack, screaming, sad, and I can't think straight."
"I've been crying nonstop for days, and I just can't seem to get a grip on my emotions."
This month has been a total emotional rollercoaster. I'm exhausted from all the crying and anxiety.
I'm feeling so overwhelmed and fragile. It's like my brain is just shutting down.
I can't believe how much I've been struggling lately. It's like I'm stuck in a cycle of sadness and despair.
This emotional turmoil is really taking its toll. I just need a break from all the pain.
"I go from being easy going, positive, clean and take pride in myself and my house... to literally cannot function and my house becomes a mess... simple tasks like drinking a glass of water or having a shower becomes a mountain and I cannot fathom how anyone functions or copes. All I want to do it stay in bed and hide from the world. Doing anything feels like I am struggling through thick sand with my head just above but I might go under soon..."
"I feel like I'm constantly switching between feeling energetic and capable, to feeling completely overwhelmed and exhausted."
"It's like a switch flips, and suddenly the simplest things become impossible, and I just want to disappear."
"I used to love taking care of myself and my home, but now even basic tasks feel like an insurmountable challenge."
The contrast between my usual self and how I feel during these episodes is jarring and disheartening.
"It's like my body and mind are at war, and I'm caught in the middle, unable to function."
"when i first started college 3 years ago, i almost immediately started having panic attacks and became extremely suicidal. my mom started tracking when these events would happen and it mainly was a couple of days before my period or right in the middle of my cycle during ovulation."
"My mental health took a drastic turn when I started college, and it became clear that my period was playing a major role in my anxiety and suicidal thoughts."
"It was a terrifying experience to go through, but having my mom track my cycle helped me understand that my mental health was deeply tied to my hormonal fluctuations."
"The panic attacks and suicidal feelings were overwhelming, especially in the days leading up to my period and during ovulation."
"I felt completely out of control, like my body was betraying me, and it took a lot of courage to seek help and learn how to manage my mental health."
"It was a painful realization, but I finally understood that the extreme emotions I was experiencing weren't just 'me' – they were linked to my menstrual cycle, and there was hope for managing them."
"I’ve known about this diagnosis for a couple years, but I don’t know how I can learn to live with it when it feels like a moving goalpost. The brain fog, I’m quite literally unable to function, walking around aimlessly sometimes, earlier this week, I drove away from my house with no shoes. I can’t finish my tasks at work. At home, it feels like mayhem runs through the rooms."
"I feel like I'm constantly trying to catch up, but the diagnosis just keeps changing."
It's hard to adjust to this new reality when it feels like I'm constantly being thrown curveballs.
"I'm struggling to find a new normal, and it feels like I'm just getting knocked off balance again and again."
"I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's exhausting."
"I just don't know how to cope with the uncertainty, it's like I'm living in a fog."
"Fatigue- feeling 'run-down' to heavy legs collapse in bed tired, Headaches (tension and icepick) to full on migranes, General aches, mainly shoulders legs/pelvis, Hip pain, like wake you up in the night bad, Cramps/back pain tender sides, ovary pain, bloating"
"Her yerim ağrıyor, özellikle omuzlarım, bacaklarım ve kalçalarım."
"Başım çatlıyor, sanki içine buz çakılmış gibi."
"Uyandıktan sonra bile yorgun hissediyorum, sanki tüm enerjim tükenmiş gibi."
"Geçen gece çok kötü kramplar çektim, o kadar kötüydü ki uyandım."
"Sırtım ve yanlarım ağrıyor, sanki kemiklerim kırılıyormuş gibi. "
when the luteal phase comes around i have a devastating “realisation” that every aspect of my life is terrible. i am the worst person on earth and everyone hates me and i am disgusting everything is going wrong and (TW) i no longer wish to be breathing.
"During my luteal phase, I experience an overwhelming sense of despair, believing that every aspect of my life is awful, that I'm the worst person imaginable, and everyone despises me. I feel disgusted by myself, convinced everything is falling apart, and (TW) I even contemplate not wanting to live anymore."
"The luteal phase brings with it a crushing realization that everything in my life is a complete disaster. I feel like the most terrible person, utterly disliked by everyone, and completely repulsive. It feels like every single thing is going wrong, and (TW) the thought of living becomes unbearable."
"The arrival of the luteal phase always triggers a devastating sense of hopelessness. I convince myself that every aspect of my life is terrible, that I'm the worst person on Earth, hated by everyone, and completely disgusting. It feels like everything is spiraling out of control, and (TW) I find myself wishing I could simply cease to exist."
"My luteal phase always brings with it a debilitating wave of self-loathing and despair. I see every aspect of my life as irrevocably broken, feel like the worst person possible, and imagine everyone around me hating me. The feeling of disgust towards myself is overwhelming, everything seems to be going wrong, and (TW) the desire to simply stop existing becomes overwhelming."
"The luteal phase always seems to usher in this devastating feeling of complete and utter inadequacy. I become convinced that I'm the worst person alive, that everyone despises me, and that everything in my life is awful. I feel disgusted by myself, and it feels like everything is falling apart. (TW) The thought of breathing feels like an unbearable burden."
"I thought I'd start a thread of what helps me when experiencing extreme pmdd symptoms, for me, that's extreme low feelings, vulnerability, sensitivity exhaustion"
I wanted to share some things that help me cope with the intense emotional swings I get during PMDD.
I thought it might be helpful to share some strategies I use when I'm really struggling with PMDD.
"I'm feeling very vulnerable and sensitive right now, so I wanted to talk about what helps me during these times."
"I know I'm not alone in dealing with extreme PMDD symptoms, so I hope this thread can be helpful for others too."
"I'm feeling so drained and overwhelmed by my PMDD symptoms, I'm looking for any support I can get."
I wish I knew at least one other woman IRL with PMDD who actually related to me that I could talk to about this
"I feel so alone dealing with PMDD, I wish I knew someone else who understood what I go through."
"It's so hard to explain PMDD to people who haven't experienced it, I just wish I had someone to talk to who truly gets it."
"I'm exhausted from trying to explain PMDD to people who just don't understand, I need someone who's been there."
"I've been feeling so isolated with PMDD, I just want to connect with someone else who understands."
"It's so isolating to deal with PMDD, I'm desperate for someone who knows what I'm going through."
"I loathe my period, it’s apart of me and I am apart of nature. No matter how much of a wreck I feel during the week/s before it starts, I am apart of something bigger."
"I know it's a natural part of life, but I still hate that I have to deal with my period every month."
"It's frustrating, but I try to remember that my period is just a small part of a bigger cycle."
"I hate feeling like a mess during my period, but it's important to remember that I'm not alone."
"I know my body is doing what it's supposed to, but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with the physical and emotional changes."
"Even though I feel like I'm going crazy during my period, I know it's a temporary thing and I'll get through it."
"non-stop 24/7 obsessive thoughts, health anxiety, panic attacks, crying spells, rage, self-harm etc."
"Sürekli aklımda dönen düşünceler, sağlıkla ilgili endişeler, panik ataklar, ağlama nöbetleri, öfke, kendine zarar verme gibi şeyler beni sürekli rahatsız ediyor."
"Duygusal olarak çöküyorum, her an panik atak geçiriyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum ve kendime zarar verme isteği duyuyorum."
"Bir türlü durmayan düşünceler, sağlık kaygıları, panik ataklar ve öfke nöbetleri beni tüketiyor."
"İçimi kemiren düşünceler, sağlık endişeleri, panik ataklar ve öfke patlamaları beni mahvediyor."
"Sürekli endişe, korku ve öfke içinde yaşıyorum, bu durumun beni tükettiğini hissediyorum."
I have never told a man that I’m in a relationship with about PMDD out of fear of not being listened to and told that I’m insane for “making up” something like that. I already struggle with vulnerability in general.
I've been hesitant to discuss PMDD with romantic partners because I fear they won't take me seriously and might even dismiss my experiences as fabricated.
"The idea of opening up about PMDD to a partner makes me nervous, as I've encountered skepticism and disbelief in the past, and I find vulnerability challenging in general."
"I've avoided talking about PMDD with men I'm dating because I'm afraid of being disregarded and accused of exaggerating or making things up, especially since vulnerability isn't my strong suit."
"The fear of being dismissed and labeled as crazy for talking about PMDD prevents me from being open with romantic partners, especially given my general struggle with vulnerability."
"I haven't shared my PMDD experiences with men I'm involved with due to a fear of being dismissed or labeled as insane, coupled with my general difficulty with vulnerability."
I’m in the depths of horrendous PMDD (...) and dealing with executive dysfunction despite taking my adderall this morning. I’ve had such a hard time doing the bare minimum these last couple of weeks and seeing shit like this just irks me.
"I'm having a really rough time with PMDD and can't seem to get anything done, even with my medication."
"This PMDD is making it so hard to function, even with my adderall, and seeing things like this just makes it worse."
"It's been such a struggle to even do the basics lately, and things like this really get under my skin."
"I'm really struggling with executive dysfunction and motivation right now, and this just feels like another unnecessary challenge."
"I'm in the midst of a really tough PMDD episode, and seeing things like this just adds to the frustration of not being able to function properly."
"In SOME luteal phases, I have extreme anxiety to the point it manifests into physical symptoms like tension headaches, dizziness, head buzzing, constant panic attacks throughout the day, extreme and I mean EXTREME fatigue and post exertional malaise after doing anything mildly strenuous."
"My luteal phase anxiety is SO bad sometimes that it's not just mental, it's physical too."
"I get these awful physical symptoms during my luteal phase, like headaches, dizziness, and panic attacks, it's so intense."
"The fatigue I get during my luteal phase is unreal, even just a little exercise makes me feel completely wiped out."
"It's not just anxiety, it's like my body is physically reacting to my hormones during my luteal phase."
The anxiety I experience during my luteal phase is so overwhelming that it causes physical symptoms like headaches and dizziness.
"I feel so deflated, defeated...I feel like giving up...I feel really depressed, I don’t want to talk to anyone, I don’t really feel like doing anything...I felt this awful anxiety and sadness...I feel like I’m always argumentative and angry before my period and I can’t stop it and regret it 5 minutes later...my ovaries were hurting today..."
"I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and hopeless, like everything is too much to handle."
"It's like a dark cloud is following me, and I can't seem to shake it off."
"I just want to crawl under the covers and disappear, I'm so exhausted emotionally."
Everything feels pointless and I can't find any motivation to do anything.
"I feel so out of control, like my emotions are running wild and I can't catch them."
I get suuuuper irritable... then I start feeling like everyone hates me
"I get so easily frustrated, and then I start thinking that nobody likes me."
"When I'm really annoyed, I get this feeling that everyone is against me."
"I get really cranky sometimes, and then I convince myself that everyone is out to get me."
I get so angry that I think everyone is just waiting for a chance to criticize me.
"If I'm in a bad mood, I start to feel like everyone is judging me."
"awful anxiety, depression, question my relationship, my worth, my choices, my childhood trauma haunts me, I think about harming myself, I feel overwhelmed and I’m horribly unpleasant to be around. The physical pain is debilitating for at least 2 days."
"I feel completely lost and like I'm drowning in a sea of negativity, the constant pain is unbearable and makes it hard to function."
"The weight of my past trauma, coupled with my current struggles, makes me feel like I'm on the verge of breaking."
"I can't seem to escape the cycle of self-doubt and despair, it's exhausting and I don't know how much longer I can keep going."
"My anxiety is so intense that it feels like a physical force constricting my chest, making it impossible to breathe."
"I'm struggling to find the strength to keep going, everything feels overwhelming and I'm afraid of what the future holds."
"I had a bad flare up this month.(physically weak, fever-ish, tender breasts, dissociative, superb anxious, depressive mood, self harm thoughts and so on), I still feel feverish time to time, I have elevated anxiety and sudden exhaustion with low mood that comes and goes."
"This month has been really rough, I've been feeling weak, feverish, my breasts are tender, I've been dissociating, super anxious, and depressed, and even having thoughts of self-harm. I still feel feverish sometimes, my anxiety is high, and I have sudden waves of exhaustion and low mood that come and go."
"I've been having a really tough time this month, physically and emotionally. I've been weak, feverish, my breasts are sore, and I've been feeling dissociative, extremely anxious, and depressed.

"I'm going through a really difficult period right now. I've been feeling physically weak, feverish, and my breasts are tender. Mentally, I've been struggling with dissociation, extreme anxiety, depression, and even thoughts of self-harm. I still feel feverish occasionally, my anxiety is high, and I have sudden bouts of exhaustion and low mood."
"This month has been a rollercoaster of physical and emotional discomfort. I've had a bad flare-up, feeling weak, feverish, and my breasts are tender. On top of that, I've been experiencing dissociation, intense anxiety, depression, and even thoughts of self-harm. I still feel feverish sometimes, my anxiety is high, and I have sudden episodes of exhaustion and low mood."

I still feel feverish sometimes, my anxiety is high, and I have sudden periods of exhaustion and low mood that come and go."
"I suffer from borderline personality disorder during my pmdd hell weeks (after that, I have no issues with it). I suffer from severe chronic mdd and severe chronic gad. I'm often physically in so much pain, just standing or being alive hurts every inch of my body."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling a whirlwind of emotions during those intense PMS weeks, but the rest of the time, it's manageable."
"My life feels like a constant struggle with depression and anxiety, and on top of that, my physical pain makes even simple tasks unbearable."
"It's like I'm trapped in a cycle of intense emotional swings during my PMS, but outside of those few weeks, I'm mostly okay."
"I often feel overwhelmed by a combination of severe depression, anxiety, and chronic pain, making it incredibly difficult to function."
"The constant struggle with mental illness and physical pain leaves me feeling exhausted and drained, making it hard to enjoy life."
I have seen that PMDD could be classified as a disability and could qualify for FMLA. But I anticipate repercussions from my boss as she is really passive aggressive. We are allowed mental health days at work but it doesn’t come without judgement. Do you ever miss work due to PMDD?
I'm worried about how my boss will react if I take time off for PMDD.
"It's frustrating that even though we have mental health days, they're not always taken seriously."
"I'm not sure if I should even try to take FMLA leave for PMDD, I'm afraid of the backlash."
I wish there was more understanding and support for people with PMDD in the workplace.
"I feel like I have to hide my PMDD from my boss, which is exhausting."
I’ve had a range of symptoms anxiety depression panic attacks paranoia….. always much worst during luteal phase…. I have uncontrollable intrusive thoughts paranoia that leads to me having panic attacks and exploding my perfectly lovely life…. I cannot stop the paranoid thoughts I’m so suspicious I make things up in my head then accuse him…. I know I’m being ridiculous deep down but I CANNOT control the thoughts and things that come out of my mouth it’s like I’m powerless
"I feel like I'm losing control, the thoughts are coming so fast I can't even keep up with them."
"It's like my brain is betraying me, it's telling me things I know aren't true but I can't stop believing them."
"I feel so trapped in my own head, like I'm watching myself go crazy from the inside."
"It's like a dark cloud following me around, I can't escape the feeling of dread and paranoia."
"I'm so scared of what I might do or say next, I feel like I'm on the edge of a breakdown."
"My uterus feels full during the last 7 days of my cycle... I feel washed out, heavy, tired, tender. It is centred in my uterus. All of my other emotions are in my chest and belly."
"I'm feeling a lot of pressure and discomfort in my lower abdomen, especially during the last week of my cycle."
"The last few days of my cycle have been really tough, I feel exhausted and like there's a weight in my uterus."
"I've been carrying a lot of emotional weight these past few days, and it feels like it's all concentrated in my chest and abdomen."
"My body is definitely feeling the effects of my cycle, it's like everything is centred in my uterus and I'm feeling very heavy and drained."
"This last week of my cycle has been a real rollercoaster, I'm feeling a lot of physical and emotional pressure, and I just want to feel normal again."
Depression and anxiety worsen when I eat healthy foods during luteal. I felt like I can't win. Do I give into luteal carb and fat cravings and gain more weight or eat chicken and veg and risk a full on mental break down with severe ideation?
"My body is telling me to eat unhealthy things, but my mind is screaming at me to stay healthy, and I don't know what to do."
"I feel trapped between my cravings and my need to be healthy, and it's driving me crazy."
"It's like my body is sabotaging my efforts to stay healthy, and I'm starting to feel hopeless."
"I'm constantly battling with my own body and mind, and it's exhausting."
"The luteal phase is like a constant battle between my cravings and my desire to stay healthy, and I feel like I'm losing."
"When I get overly emotional, be it angry or sad, I start to spot or bleed heavier. Even if it's not on my end of my cycle, I'll spot and cramp."
I find that my period gets heavier and I experience spotting when I'm stressed or feeling very emotional.
"Whenever I'm feeling really down or angry, I seem to have more bleeding or spotting, even if I'm not on my period."
"My emotions definitely affect my cycle; if I'm feeling really stressed, I often have more spotting or a heavier flow."
"It's frustrating, but I've noticed that strong emotions, whether it's joy or sadness, can trigger heavier bleeding or spotting."
"I'm not sure why, but when I'm emotionally overwhelmed, I tend to have more cramps and heavier bleeding, even if it's not my period."
I feel so bad! I usually love it when he send me selfies at work. But this week I’m REPULSED when he does
"I’m totally grossed out by the selfies he’s been sending this week, I normally love them!"
"I usually love when he sends me selfies at work, but this week it just feels...icky."
"His selfies are usually so cute, but this week I can’t even look at them without feeling repulsed."
I feel like I’m going to be sick every time I see a new selfie from him this week.
"He sends me selfies all the time and I usually love it, but this week I just feel so repulsed by them."
"I’ve been diagnosed with PMDD for a few years now and haven’t found anything successful yet. I can not take a pill with estrogen in it due to my migraines. I’m currently on Prozac and have been before in the past, but it’s hard to tell if it does anything, especially when the episode gets bad."
"I've tried different medications and therapies, but nothing has been able to completely manage my PMDD symptoms."
"I'm constantly searching for a solution that works for me, but it's frustrating to hit roadblocks like my estrogen allergy."
"It feels like I'm constantly caught in a cycle of trying new things and hoping they'll provide relief, but so far, nothing has been a silver bullet."
"Prozac provides some level of support, but it's not a cure-all, especially when the PMDD symptoms are intense."
"I'm hoping to find a treatment that can effectively address the hormonal fluctuations and mood swings associated with PMDD, but it's a difficult journey."
"I felt so depressed in life. Then I had a fight with my mom where I snapped at her and I feel terrible. My boyfriend, who I would ideally want to talk to is also unavailable at the moment and I just want to cry into my pillow for the next few years. I feel so lonely and miserable."
I'm at my wit's end and I just feel like everything is falling apart.
I'm drowning in sadness and I don't know how to swim back to the surface.
"I'm so exhausted from carrying this weight, I just want to collapse and disappear."
"I'm surrounded by people, but I feel so isolated and alone."
I feel like I'm in freefall and there's no one to catch me.
my mind and body make me feel like a prisoner. I cry uncontrollable; am unmotivated and cant get moving- like during a Pmdd episode but x 2. I feel trapped in my own dysfunctioning mind/body. cant even get myself to clean. see people. 
My mind and body feel like a prison. I'm trapped in my own dysfunction.

I had a major disagreement with him last week. It was a really tough time.
We had a big fight last week. I wasn't feeling myself and said some things I shouldn't have.

I was feeling really vulnerable last week. He took advantage of that and said some really hurtful things.
"Before HRT I had severe pmdd symptoms, but minimal period cramps, I would have bad joint pain and be uncomfortable but I never had to use pain meds when I was on my period. As soon as I started HRT my period pain was absolutely excruciating, never before experienced this level of period pain before, now I have to use the strongest painkillers I have available, and I am still in pain."
"My period pain used to be manageable, even with joint discomfort, but after starting HRT, it's become unbearable, requiring the strongest painkillers."
"Prior to HRT, I never needed pain medication for my period, even with pmdd symptoms, but now the pain is so intense I'm constantly relying on painkillers."

"I used to be able to handle my period pain without medication, but now, thanks to HRT, the pain is so severe I'm forced to use the strongest painkillers available."
Your thoughts are not your own even if they feel real... Write it down and see how you feel after your period started...
"The thoughts you experience may not be entirely your own, even if they feel genuine. Write them down and see how your perspective shifts after your period begins."
"Our thoughts are often influenced by external factors, even if they seem like our own. Capture them in writing and observe how your emotions evolve after your cycle starts."

"I have one week that’s pretty bad and I mostly need space this week, but my partner doesn’t give me enough space, he also makes tongue in cheek jokes or is sarcastic both things are trigger for me and I have told him to not do that this particular week, I also feel that because he too has PtSd from our fights he assumes i’m going to be a bitch and will not answer my calls which makes me even more miserable"
"I'm going through a rough week and need some space to myself, but my partner isn't respecting my boundaries. He's been making jokes and being sarcastic, which really triggers me, and I've asked him to stop this week. It also feels like he's assuming I'll be angry and won't answer his calls because of our past fights, which just makes things worse."
"I'm struggling right now and need time to myself, but my partner keeps making jokes at my expense, which really upsets me. I've asked him to stop, but he doesn't seem to understand how sensitive I am this week. I think he's worried about me getting upset and won't answer his calls, but that's just adding to my stress."
"This week has been really hard for me, and I need some space to deal with everything. My partner doesn't seem to understand that, though. He's being sarcastic and making jokes, which are really triggering for me. I've asked him to stop, but he's not listening. I think he's avoiding me because he's afraid I'll be angry, but that just makes me feel worse."
"I'm going through a rough patch and need some time to myself, but my partner isn't giving me the space I need. He's been making snarky comments and jokes, which really get to me right now. I've asked him to stop, but he doesn't seem to get it. I think he's expecting me to be upset and won't answer his calls, but that's just adding to my frustration."
"I'm in a really fragile place right now and need time alone to process everything. My partner doesn't seem to understand that, though. He's being sarcastic and making jokes, which are really hurtful to me right now. I've asked him to stop, but he's not listening. I think he's avoiding me because he's afraid I'll be angry, but that's just making things worse."
"I have OCD/PMDD/ADHD so I make everything worse. I get insanely stressed when the heat because he is at risk for a stroke. He gets dizzy and clumsy and I have OCD/PMDD/ADHD so I make everything worse. I just think about how killing myself would spare him from me being a frazzled, mean, emotional bitch time bomb 12 days a month. I feel like such a bitch for dismissing him, getting aggravated, losing his present... I just want to fucking die. I've tried explaining to him before that 'mommy's brain has problems and I forget things and need extra quiet time sometimes'."
"I feel so guilty for snapping at him, he doesn't deserve that, but I can't help it when my brain just feels like it's going to explode."
"I wish I could just be normal, like other moms, but I'm not. I'm a mess and I make everything worse."

"It's like I'm trapped in my own mind, a prisoner of my own emotions, and I can't escape the constant feeling of guilt and shame."
"I just want to be a good mom, I want to be a good wife, but I feel like I'm failing at both. I'm just a broken person."
I keep having these intrusive thoughts thoughts like: What if hes dying? What if hes suffering? Am I being selfish? How many more years will I have with him? What will I do when he passes? Will I feel suicidal? I feel sad because I feel like he hates me because of the meds and Im scared he will get sicker and die. I think about losing him and I just want to curl up and die. Im so scared and I cant stop thinking about the worse case scenerio.
"I can't shake this overwhelming feeling of dread, imagining him in pain and the pain I'll feel after he's gone."
"It's like a loop in my head, playing out his decline and my own despair."
"Every little cough, every slight change, it sends me spiraling down this dark path of worry and grief."
"The thought of losing him, of the void it would leave, it's consuming and I can't find a way to escape it."
"I'm so terrified of what the future holds, of the pain I know I'll face, and it feels like I'm already drowning in it."
struggling so much that I’m trying to find reasons to live
I feel so lost and hopeless that I'm searching for a purpose.
The pain is so overwhelming that I'm clinging to any reason to keep going.
I'm fighting so hard against these feelings that I'm desperately searching for a reason to exist.
My life feels so empty right now that I'm trying to find a spark of hope.
"The weight of everything is crushing me, and I'm desperately trying to find a reason to carry on."
"The misogyny is fn outta control... the amount of times I’ve shared an idea, had it get shot down... and then someone else says the SAME idea and it’s GENIUS... and the one time I spoke up for myself indicating I had just suggested that I was told “we’re a team, Katie, credit is unimportant”"
"The sexism in this workplace is so blatant, it’s ridiculous. I’ve had so many of my ideas dismissed, only to see them praised when someone else says the exact same thing."
"I'm so tired of having my contributions ignored, only to have others get credit for my ideas. It's like my voice doesn't even matter."
"It’s incredibly frustrating to see my ideas get rejected, but then the same ideas get praised when someone else says them. It's like my perspective is invisible."
"I've lost count of the number of times I've had my ideas shot down, only to see them adopted and celebrated by someone else. It's like my contributions are being erased."
"The lack of respect for women's voices in this environment is astounding. I’ve had my ideas dismissed, then seen the same ideas praised when someone else suggests them, and when I speak up about it, I'm told to be a team player. It's like my voice doesn't matter."
You know how you overthink during luteal phase? ... It's not those things that keep you trapped. It's your focus on them. ... You matter more than what anyone thinks of you or how anyone perceives you. **You can't wait for anything or anyone to feel better. It has to start with you**. ... Your worst enemy are your thoughts. What if it will work out? What if you just radically believed in yourself?
Your happiness can't be contingent on someone else's approval or actions.
You have to take ownership of your own well-being.
"It's not about waiting for the perfect moment, it's about creating it yourself."
"Stop waiting for permission to feel good, give yourself that permission."
"The power to change your life lies within you, not in external circumstances."
"usually my sleep hygiene is great, I exercise, eat well, propranolol or go nuclear w a benzo and nothing will touch it"
"Genellikle uyku düzenim mükemmeldir, egzersiz yaparım, iyi beslenirim, propranolol kullanırım veya benzo ile 'nukleer' bir yol izlerim, hiçbir şey beni uyutmaz."

"Uyku konusunda genellikle problemim yoktur, egzersiz yaparım, sağlıklı beslenir, propranolol veya benzo kullanırım, uyuyabilirim."
"I have almost all symptoms and share a lot of experiences... Every cycle since the beginning of this year has been a torment and it only seems to get worse. I have 1 good week out of every month. 2 weeks before my period begins, I’m an absolute mess and the week after I’m so exhausted from the mental stress of it all that I have to recover. ... Then 5:30pm came and it was like a switch flipped in my head and I became immobilized. I’m so exhausted despite having 2 cups of coffee and a 45 minute nap. I’ve eaten today and drank water and yet I cannot stop shaking. My eyelids are heavy and I’m experiencing vertigo and all of my negative thoughts started hitting me at once. ... I’m fighting tears and thoughts and it’s taking such a toll. ... My irritability for those full 3 weeks is almost painful, everything pisses me off. ... I’m just so tired of feeling this way. I’m sick of feeling 100% myself and then instantly I’m incapable of daily tasks within the span of a few seconds."
"I'm so tired of this roller coaster ride of emotions, the highs and lows are so extreme."
"It's like my body and mind are constantly at war, and I'm caught in the crossfire."
"It feels like my life is a cycle of pain and exhaustion, and I'm just trying to survive."
"I long for a day where I can function normally, without being overwhelmed by my own body."
"I just want to feel like myself again, but it feels like this is the new normal."
"I just recently went to my gynaecologist because of severe pmdd, which ruined five days to a week of every month...my mood has been really numbed. Usually I feel energetic in the first half of my cycle, this time I’m just feeling isolated and numb...I have cramps 24/7 and the typical period diarrhoea."
"I'm so exhausted from the constant pain and emotional swings, it's hard to even get out of bed sometimes."
"I'm feeling so disconnected from myself and the world around me, it's like I'm just going through the motions."
"I hate that PMDD takes away so much of my life every month, it's like I'm not even myself."
"I just want to feel normal again, I'm so tired of being ruled by my hormones."
"It feels like my body is betraying me, it's so frustrating to feel so powerless over my own health."
a little bit less depressed
I'm feeling a little bit less depressed today.
My mood is slightly better than it was before.
The depression has lifted a bit.
I'm starting to feel a little more hopeful.
I'm not quite as down as I was.
I have high anxiety and haven’t had an irregular period in a long time. It’s been 3 days late from my regular 27 days. I’m on 31 days. I just gives me more anxiety knowing I missed a period more than anything.
"I'm really worried because I haven't missed a period in ages, and now it's 3 days late. My usual cycle is 27 days, and today is day 31."
"I'm feeling very stressed about my period being late. It's been 3 days since my expected date, and I'm on day 31 of my cycle, which is unusual for me."
"I'm anxious because my period is 3 days late. I'm normally regular, with a 27-day cycle, and it's starting to feel strange being on day 31."
"I can't help but feel anxious because my period is late.  It's 3 days past my usual 27-day cycle, and I'm on day 31.  It's been so long since I've had an irregular period."
"It's been 3 days since my expected period, and I'm starting to get really anxious. My usual cycle is 27 days, and today is day 31. I've been so regular lately, and this is just making me feel more stressed."
"mentally ill, sleeping worse, can’t orgasm, just everything in my life has generally declined"
My mental health is really struggling and it's affecting every part of my life.
"I'm having trouble sleeping, I can't seem to enjoy intimacy anymore, and everything feels like it's getting worse."
"My energy is gone, I'm constantly anxious, and even the things I used to love just don't feel the same."
"I'm feeling so overwhelmed and hopeless, I don't know what to do anymore."
"Everything feels so difficult, like I'm constantly swimming upstream."
All my life I suffered from depression and anxiety and it was actually just ADHD!... I just thought something’s not right with me.
"For years I struggled with feeling down and stressed, only to realize it was ADHD all along."
"I spent so much time feeling like I was broken, but now I know it was just a different way of thinking."
"It never occurred to me that my struggles could be explained by ADHD, I just felt like something was wrong with me."
"I always thought I was lazy or unmotivated, but now I know it was just my ADHD getting in the way."
"It’s such a relief to know that my problems weren’t my fault, it was just ADHD making me feel different."
"I feel so down on myself, like I’ll never be able to lose weight again. Especially with PMDD, every month I can’t stop eating, I’m literally in agony when I do it."
I'm so disappointed in myself for not being able to stick to my diet.
"I feel like I'm destined to be overweight, no matter what I do."
"My PMDD makes it impossible to control my cravings, and it's so frustrating."
"I know I need to lose weight, but it feels like an impossible task with my hormones."
"Every month, I'm forced to endure the agony of PMDD cravings, and it makes me feel like I'm failing myself."
I break out so bad... cystic acne under my skin that hurts so bad.
"My skin is breaking out so bad, it's painful."
I'm having a cystic acne breakout and it's really hurting.
"The cystic acne under my skin is so painful, it's driving me crazy."
I'm dealing with a bad breakout of cystic acne and the pain is unbearable.
"This cystic acne breakout is so bad, it's literally making me cry."
"Everytime I get my luteal phase, I’m taken right back to the memories of my assault and want to just die. The smells, moments, images, sounds, and places immediately bring up my trauma and I just want to crawl in a hole and throw up. ... I felt that gross nauseous feeling in my stomach and chest and everything just came back all at once. ... I started my zoloft today but gosh… I don’t know if I can take this for much longer. I just feel so irreparably broken inside that I feel like giving up."
"The physical sensations of my luteal phase trigger a flood of traumatic memories, making me feel overwhelmed and hopeless."

"I've noticed in the last year to year and a half that my daughter, 5 years old, gets so moody around the time that my PMDD symptoms kick in... crying at very small things, easily angered, much more fatigue. I acted when not medicated."
"I've been seeing a pattern lately, especially around the time my PMDD symptoms get bad, where my daughter has been acting out with these strange mood swings, just like she's taking on my symptoms."
I can't help but notice that my 5 year old's mood swings seem to mirror my PMDD.  She's been easily angered and prone to crying over the littlest things just like I do when I'm not medicated.
The correlation between my daughter's behavior and my PMDD symptoms has become almost comical. It's like she's absorbing my irritability and fatigue. 
"For the last year or so, it feels like my daughter has been in tune with my PMDD. Every time my symptoms flare up, she starts acting like a completely different kid. It's like she's channeling my energy."
"My daughter's been so sensitive and moody lately, particularly when my PMDD is really bad. I've even noticed she's starting to exhibit some of the same physical symptoms, like fatigue."
I'm really close to killing myself every week before my period...
I can barely function the week before my period.
My emotions are all over the place in the days leading up to my period.
I get so irritable and anxious that I want to pull my hair out.
The week before my period is like a constant battle with myself.
I feel like I'm going to explode every week before my period.
Last night I had an utter panic attack... Everyday these thoughts come to my mind and I often see the worst case scenarios with everything in life... I wonder if I have a depressive disorder alongside PMDD. But right now I’m in peak PMDD and I just can’t stop crying. ... I’m beginning to think I have anxiety and depressive disorder and possibly ocd contributing to the obsessive thoughts I have.

"I would be up all night, every night before my period, even if I was exhausted."
"My period would always bring with it sleeplessness, no matter how tired I was."
"Sleep was a luxury I couldn't afford in the days leading up to my period, even when I was absolutely drained."

"My body just wouldn't let me sleep in the days leading up to my period, no matter how tired I was."
"i’m still depressed, low energy"
I just feel so drained and unmotivated.
I'm really struggling to find the energy to do anything.
Everything feels overwhelming and I just want to stay in bed.
"I'm so tired, even getting out of bed is a struggle."
"I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, nothing seems to excite me anymore."
"I have regular anxiety, ocd that’s worse when triggered, and depression. I’m in a really bad bout of OCD, depression and general anxiety right now, I’ve had a bad bout 9 months ago and another one previously this year as well as when I was going through puberty."
"I feel like I'm constantly battling these mental health issues, it's exhausting."
"It's like my mind is constantly in overdrive, and I can't seem to switch off."
"I'm just so tired of feeling this way, I wish I could just find some peace."
"I know I'm not alone, but it's still hard to deal with this on my own."
"I really need to find a way to manage this, I can't keep living like this."
it's so disheartening when...silence us too

"It's heartbreaking when we're silenced, when our ideas and perspectives are ignored."
"It's infuriating to be silenced, to be denied the opportunity to speak our minds."
"It's deeply unsettling when silence is used as a weapon, to suppress our thoughts and opinions."
"I track my cycle...I journal my feelings and remind myself it’s hormones and it will pass. I do my best to be kind to myself...At work...the labor-like cramps come in and I feel like I’m going to puke...Then the same mantra that plays each month in my head begins. “Everyone hates you, these aren’t your real friends, you’re worthless, you’re stupid, you’re annoying and boring. Just end it.”...Once I got home I felt so wiped out. I was shaking from anxiety and feeling the grief of my mom’s death that happened over a year ago as if it was day 1...I decided I needed to just write EVERYTHING that was going on in my head. It was running a million miles per hour...I reminded myself: “This is PMDD, you know what it is. You are loved, you miss your mom but it wasn’t your fault. Your hormones are causing this. You’re going to feel better tomorrow.”"
"I know it's just the PMDD, but it feels like everything is falling apart."
"The anxiety and grief feel so overwhelming, but I remind myself it's temporary."
"I try to stay positive and remember that this is just a phase, it won't last forever."
"I'm struggling with intense feelings, but I'm trying to be patient with myself."
"It's hard to see past the pain, but I'm holding onto hope that things will get better."

I have been bedridden for days. The fatigue is bad. This morning i woke up just crying and crying. I fear i will go insane or that i have hallucinations. I feel insanely hot and cold at times. Im sweating so much. Its day 4 and hormones seem to be low at that time? I also feel so nausous.

I feel like my symptoms mimic a personality disorder. I feel like I can actively feel myself switching throughout the course of my cycle but especially throughout the days during my luteal phase.

"My blender's state is a metaphor for my life, I feel like I'm stuck in a messy, hopeless place."
"The dirt on my blender is making me feel like a failure, like I'm just spiraling out of control."
"Looking at my blender reminds me of how I feel about myself, worthless, insignificant, and lost."
"I know it's just a blender, but the messiness and the feeling of being overwhelmed is just too much."
"My thoughts are a tangled mess, just like the sticky remnants of my smoothie in the blender, and I can't seem to get out of this rut."
I forgot emotional trauma. I’m looking to validate those they don’t realize that they may also suffer from PTSD or CPTSD. There is a correlation between trauma and PMDD.

I wish I could just skip those weeks altogether.
"I'm considering talking to a doctor about it, maybe there's something that can help."
I feel like I'm always dealing with something related to my cycle.
I woke up in a fucking spiral. It’s all just despair and envy. Why is it that financial fears are so overwhelming and paralyzing? One thought sparks a fire that my mind just can’t put out.

This constant anxiety is wearing me down. I can't seem to escape the feeling of dread.
It's like I'm drowning in a sea of self-doubt. I feel completely lost and alone.

"Despite the challenges, it was all worth it. The experience helped me understand that it was the hormones, not some deep-seated issue, that were causing the difficulties."

"I can't say I loved the journey, but I wouldn't trade the destination. It's comforting to know that it's the hormones, not some internal issue, that are causing these changes."

"It feels like he's constantly trying to hurt my feelings, even if it's not intentional."
"I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, afraid to say or do the wrong thing."
Every little thing he says or does makes me feel insecure and like our relationship is falling apart.
"I get so defensive and emotional, and I end up blowing things out of proportion."
"I just don't give a fuck. Like my brain does not care. I just care for YouTube videos, podcasts, reddit sometimes, like anything that makes me feel connected to people. Because I don't connect to the people or anything around me for that matter. And online I can find people who I relate to. I guess I should care but nothing in me does right now.

"I don't even know who I am anymore, it's like I'm just a collection of algorithms and internet memes."
I didn’t expect it to be this bad because I was fine without my prescription meds for a few months. I only take them when it’s bad. I only have been diagnosed for under a year. And now I am having huge depression episode and struggle to stay calm and not cry.
"I thought I could manage without the medication for a while, but I guess I underestimated how quickly things could change."
"I've been doing okay without my meds, but this recent episode is really hitting me hard."
I didn't realize how much I relied on my medication until I stopped taking it for a bit.
"I was feeling fine for a while, but now I'm experiencing intense depression and it's hard to cope."
"It's been less than a year since I was diagnosed, and I didn't expect to have such a severe episode so soon."
"uncontrollable irritability and anger and severe debilitating depression, I feel so worthless and damaged, I feel ripped apart inside, I feel as if my already sensitive and emotional heart has been burned alive, I can't go outside without feeling inadequate, like I don't belong in this world. I'm slowly dying inside. I can literally feel it."
"The world feels like a suffocating cage, a constant reminder of my own brokenness."
Every breath I take is a battle against the crushing weight of my own self-loathing.
"I'm drowning in a sea of despair, each wave crashing down on me with the force of a thousand sorrows."
"My insides are a battlefield, a constant struggle between the remnants of hope and the overwhelming tide of pain."

"I can't take it anymore, I'm going to explode."
"I’d have constant SI and destructive thoughts, I’d become completely delusional in my thoughts, I’d sometimes just sob for days in row, I’d struggle to leave the bed, I’d become angry and hot tempered, I’d completely withdraw from my friends and family which is totally not like me"
"I felt so lost and alone, like I was trapped in my own mind."
"The sadness was so overwhelming, I couldn't even bring myself to do the simplest things."
"I was consumed by fear and anxiety, it felt like my whole world was crumbling."
"I had this constant feeling of dread and impending doom, I couldn't shake it."
"It felt like I was living a nightmare, I couldn't even recognize myself anymore."
I feel like I'm being ripped apart from the inside out. I'm fighting.. I'm fighting the low so fucking bad. The thoughts are too intense.
I'm struggling to keep myself together. It feels like everything inside is crumbling.
This is all too much. I'm barely holding on.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. It's exhausting.
The pain is unbearable. I feel like I'm going to break.

"That sudden burst of energy after a long, grueling week is usually a sign, isn't it? Like, my brain just switched to 'go' mode."
I guess that's what they mean when they say 'feeling the relief.' My body just let out a collective sigh.
"It's like a switch flipped. One minute I'm drowning in exhaustion, and the next I'm ready to conquer the world."
It's almost like the pressure just lifted. I feel like I can finally breathe again.
It's incredible how much a little bit of rest can do. I feel like a new person.

"I get extremely depressed, and before someone gets close to me I warn them. I get insecure, needy, and anxious. I even get hypomania. I'm already hypersexual due to trauma but it intensifies."
"I feel like I'm always on edge, and I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me."
"I know I'm not easy to be around, but I'm trying to get better."
"I'm scared of being hurt, so I push people away before they can hurt me."
"I'm not always this way, but when I am it's hard to control."
"I need to find a way to manage my emotions better, but I don't know where to start."
I feel like a switch turns off and I don’t have that deep emotional connection to my partner that I usually do. I don’t feel as empathetic or affectionate I just kind of exist and don’t have the loving emotions that I usually have.
"I've lost that spark, that sense of connection I usually feel with my partner."
"It feels like a wall has come up between us, and I just don't feel the same emotional depth anymore."
"I'm not sure what's going on, but I've become emotionally distant from my partner, and it's worrying me."
"I'm just going through the motions, not really feeling the love and affection I normally do."
"I feel disconnected and empty inside, like something essential is missing in my relationship."
"“the effects of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are life-altering. Those afflicted, according to one estimate, can endure almost four years of disability, cumulatively, over their lives.” “In one study, 72% of respondents with the disorder said they’d had suicidal thoughts in their lifetime. And 34% said they had attempted suicide, compared with 3% of the general population.” “There’s not something wrong with me as an individual. I’m not crazy; this is something that’s legitimately happening to me. It helps to know I’m not alone.”"
"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) can have a devastating impact on people's lives, leading to significant disability and even suicidal thoughts."
"The statistics are sobering: almost four years of disability over a lifetime, 72% experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 34% attempting suicide, compared to 3% of the general population."
"It's important to remember that PMDD is a real, treatable condition, not a sign of weakness or a personal failing."
"For those with PMDD, the emotional and physical toll can be immense, causing significant disruptions to work, relationships, and daily life."
"The stigma surrounding PMDD often leaves sufferers feeling isolated and misunderstood, but knowing that they are not alone can be a powerful source of support."
I sometimes feel apathy towards everyone and everything. It's a general IDGAF. I don't even care if I die.
I feel a deep sense of detachment from the world around me. Nothing seems to matter anymore.
"I'm just going through the motions, existing but not truly living. I don't feel anything, not even sadness."
"I've lost all motivation. There's no point in trying, no point in caring."
"I'm just a ghost in my own life. I don't belong here, I don't feel like I matter."
"Life feels meaningless. I don't have any goals, no aspirations. I'm just drifting."
I eat a lot during luteal and I never questioned it until my partner asked me whether overeating could be bad for my overall regulation
"I tend to eat more during my luteal phase, but it never occurred to me that it could be harmful until my partner brought it up."
"I've always been a big eater during my luteal phase, but it never crossed my mind that it could affect my health."
"My appetite always goes up during my luteal phase, and I never thought twice about it until my partner raised the possibility of it being problematic."
"I'm definitely a heavier eater during my luteal phase, but I never questioned it until my partner made me think about the potential consequences."
"I've always been a big eater during my luteal phase, and it never occurred to me that it could negatively impact my overall health until my partner brought it up."
I'm still fucking fuming. I feel horribly disgusting. What a gross person I have to be. I'm close to tears hearing them in the next room; I'm FURIOUS and feel like I should just kill myself. I feel so horrible and disrespected and like my house isn't my own. I feel genuinely insane and don't know what to do. This luteal hurts on a level I never thought it would hurt before. I'm miserable and hurting and sick and tired of all this.
I'm so angry and upset I feel like I'm going to explode.
"I can't believe they would do this to me, it's just so disrespectful."
"My emotions are all over the place, I'm furious, hurt, and disgusted."
"This whole situation is making me feel completely crazy, I don't know what to do."
"I just want this pain to stop, I feel like I'm drowning in it."

I started to cry and become overwhelmed with grief... I felt completely hopeless and overwhelmed. I started have suicidal ideations more intense then I’ve ever had them during PMDD. I got really scared and was considering contacting Lifeline because I felt a strong desire to attempt. I felt like I wasn’t in my head. Like I was a different person. My mind kept screaming to just go to bed.
"The overwhelming grief, the hopelessness, it was all too much. I felt like a stranger in my own mind, trapped in a darkness I couldn't escape."
"The suicidal thoughts were stronger than ever, a dark tide pulling me under.  I was terrified, lost in a storm of despair."
"The PMDD was pushing me to the brink. I felt like I was losing myself, a stranger in my own body, drowning in a sea of pain."
"My mind was screaming, a desperate plea for escape. The urge to end it all was consuming me, a terrifying and overwhelming force."
"I was spiraling, losing control.  The world felt blurry, the edges of my reality fading.  I just wanted it all to stop."
Hormonal sağlığıma çok zararlı olduğundan ve yaklaşık on yıl sonra bugün yaşadığım semptomların temelini oluşturabileceğinden şüphelenmemi sağlıyor.
Bu hormon dengesizliğine sebep olabilir ve bu da uzun vadede ciddi sağlık sorunlarına yol açabilir.
"Bu durumun, uzun vadede vücudumda büyük hasara yol açacağını düşünüyorum."
Sağlığım için riskli olduğunu ve gelecekte daha ciddi sorunlar yaşamama neden olabileceğini düşünüyorum.
Bu durumun sağlık sorunları açısından uzun vadeli sonuçları olabileceğinden endişeleniyorum.
"Bu durumun on yıl sonra bile sağlık sorunları yaratabileceği düşünüldüğünde, şimdi önlem almak çok önemli."
"'Yine PMDD'deyim', tabii ki döngüm tekrarlıyor"
"Bu ay da PMDD'nin pençesindeyim, aynı döngü tekrar ediyor."
"İşte yine o lanet olası PMDD, aynı döngüden bir türlü kurtulamıyorum."
"Tekrar aynı döngü, yine PMDD'yle boğuşuyorum."
"Bir kez daha PMDD'nin etkisindeyim, bu döngü hiç bitmeyecek mi?"
"Aynı hikaye, aynı döngü, yine PMDD'nin pençelerindeyim."
Kendimi iyi hissediyorum ve bu yüzden gerçekten bunu yapmam gerekiyor?!...ruh halim genellikle gelmeden yaklaşık 7-10 gün önce devreye giriyor ve zaten t eksi 7 gün.
"Bu hissi çok iyi biliyorum, sanki içimde bir şey beni buna doğru itiyor."
"Bu enerjiyi hissetmek harika, artık bunun için hazır hissediyorum."
"Bu hissi çok özlemişim, her şey yoluna girecek gibi."
"Bana bu hissi yaşattığı için kendime minnettarım, artık bunun tadını çıkarabilirim."
"Bu duyguyu hissettiğimde her şey daha kolay geliyor, artık bununla baş edebilirim."
"Çok üzgün ve karamsarım... Çok uzun zamandır neşe hissetmediğimi hissediyorum... Bitmesine yakın bir yerde değilim. İyi hissetmek için çok şey yaptığımı ve hala işe yaramadığını hissettiğimde berbat. Sadece üzgün, endişeli ve en kötüsünü hissettiğimi kabul etmeliyim, çok yorgunum."
"Artık umudumu kaybetmeye başlıyorum, hiç iyileşmeyeceğim gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu kötü his, içimde derinlere işlemiş gibi, ne yaparsam yapayım silinmiyor."
"Tüm çabalarıma rağmen kendimi hala kötü hissediyorum, bu beni umutsuzluğa sürüklüyor."
"Bu sürekli üzüntü ve karamsarlık beni tüketiyor, hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum."
"İyileşmek için ellerimden gelen her şeyi yaptım ama hiçbir sonuç alamadım, bu beni çaresiz hissettiriyor."
Birkaç randevudan sonra nihayet rahmimi ve bayan toplarımı çıkarmam için yeşil ışık verildi.
Sonunda ameliyat için onay aldım.
Uzun süren beklemeden sonra ameliyat tarihi kesinleşti.
Birkaç görüşmeden sonra ameliyat için izin çıktı.
Doktor nihayet ameliyat için onay verdi.
Uzun bir süreçten sonra ameliyat planım kesinleşti.
"pmdd'im yetişiyor, herkesin nasıl yaşamam gerektiği konusunda bir fikri ve önerisi var gibi görünüyor.... Birden fazla kez farklı bc'lerde ve sadece daha kötü hale getiren ilaçlarda olduğumu söyledim, bana daha uygun rutin ve homeopatik bir yol bulmalıyım."
Benimle ilgili fikirleri ve önerileri olan herkes için minnettarım ama pmdd'imle nasıl yaşayacağımı ben bile bilmiyorum.
"Bu pmdd belirtilerini yönetmek çok zor, insanlar sürekli farklı 'çözümler' sunuyor ama hiçbiri işe yaramıyor."
"Doktorlar ilaç önermeye devam ediyor, ama ben doğal yöntemler ve daha sağlıklı bir yaşam tarzı benim için daha etkili olacağına inanıyorum."
Birkaç farklı tedavide bulundum ama hiçbiri pmdd'imin şiddetini azaltmada gerçekten yardımcı olmadı.
"Birkaç kez doktorlara ve terapiste bu durumun ne kadar zor olduğunu anlattım, ancak herkesin bir fikri olması beni yordu."
"Çok fazla güvensizlik, kendinden nefret, kıskançlık ve luteal sırasında ağlama yaşarım."
"Hormonal değişimlerin beni çok fazla güvensizliğe, kendinden nefrete, kıskançlığa ve ağlamaya sürüklediğini düşünüyorum."
"Luteal fazda olduğumda kendimi çok güvensiz, kendimden nefret eden, kıskanç ve aşırı duygusal hissediyorum."
"Bu hormonlar beni mahvediyor! Sanki kendimden nefret ediyorum, çok güvensiz ve kıskanç oluyorum, üstüne üstlük her şeyden ağlıyorum."
"Luteal fazın başlamasıyla birlikte güvensizlik, kendinden nefret, kıskançlık ve ağlama hissiyle boğuşuyorum."
"Bu dönemde kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum; aşırı güvensiz, kendimden nefret eden, kıskanç ve duygusal olarak dengesiz."
"PMDD ve hormonal kaygımla gerçekten uğraşıyorum, işi kaçırmaya başladığım noktaya kadar. Kötüyüm. Bipolarım"
"PMDD ve hormonal değişimler nedeniyle çok zor zamanlar geçiriyorum, işime konsantre olamıyorum."
"Hormonal dalgalanmalar ve PMDD yüzünden kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, işimi bile yapamıyorum."
"Sanki her şey üzerime geliyor, PMDD ve hormonal değişimlerin yol açtığı kaygı ile başa çıkamıyorum."
"Bu PMDD ve hormonal dalgalanmalar beni mahvediyor, kendimi hiçbir işe yaramaz hissediyorum."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, PMDD ve hormonal kaygı yüzünden işime bile gidemiyorum."
Çalışmaya ve her şeyi aşırı düşünmeye çalışıyorum. İşimi bırakıp ortağımı bırakıp her şeye yeniden başlamanın daha iyi olacağını düşünmeye devam ediyorum. Bu her ay saat gibi oluyor.
Her şeyin daha iyi olacağına dair umutlarımı sürekli olarak yeniden değerlendiriyorum.
"Bu his her zaman beni yakalıyor, sanki bir döngüde sıkışıp kaldım."
Her ay aynı düşüncelerle boğuşmak çok yorucu.
"Bu düşünceler işimi, ortağımı ve hayatımı ele geçiriyor."
"Değişiklik yapıp her şeyi yeniden başlatma fikri beni cezbediyor, ancak korkularım engel oluyor."
Adetimden hemen önce nüksettim... Kendimden çok utanıyorum ve gelecek ay bunu tekrar edeceğimden korkuyorum. Bir şekilde kendime daha iyi bakmam gerekiyor ama her şeyi yeniden içselleştirmeye başladım. Ben bir bok parçasıyım ve sadece böyle dürtüleri kontrol edemeyen bir insanım.
"Her ay aynı şey, kendimden tiksinerek geçiyorum. Bu sefer de kendimi kontrol edemediğimi düşününce içimde bir korku oluşuyor."
Bu durumdan ne kadar sıkıldığımı anlatamam. Kendimi kontrol edemediğimi düşününce kendime olan güvenim de sarsılıyor. 
Sanki bir çemberin içindeyim gibi hissediyorum. Kendime hakim olamamaktan ve aynı şeyleri tekrarlamaktan çok yoruldum.
Bedenim benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum. Kontrolsüzce hareket ediyor ve ben sadece izliyorum. Bu durumun beni alt etmeye başlamasından korkuyorum.
Bu durumla başa çıkmanın bir yolunu bulmam gerek.  Kendimi bu kadar kötü hissetmekten ve aynı hataları tekrarlamaktan bıktım.
"Tek başıma oturuyorum, ortağımdan kaçıyorum çünkü bugün ondan nefret ediyorum ve yardım etmiyor."
"Bugün onunla olmak istemiyorum, her şey beni sinir ediyor."
"Bu kadar yakın olmaktan bıktım, biraz zamanımı kendime ayırmam gerek."
"Onunla konuşmak istemiyorum, bugün sadece sessizliğe ihtiyacım var."
"Biraz zaman ve sakinleşmeye ihtiyacım var, bu yüzden yalnız kalıyorum."
Şimdi sadece kendime odaklanmak ve sorunlardan uzaklaşmak istiyorum.
"5 haftalık enerji yok, motivasyon yok, iştah yok, çok fazla hassasiyet (duygusal, ama aynı zamanda ısı, ışık, bazı tatlar vb.)"
"Beş haftalık yorgunluk, enerji düşüklüğü, isteksizlik ve aşırı hassasiyetle boğuşuyorum, sanki vücudum ve ruhum bir savaşın ortasında kalmış gibi."
"Sanki bir kara bulut içine hapsolmuş gibiyim, 5 haftadır enerjim, motivasyonum ve iştahım yok, her şeye aşırı hassasım, hatta en ufak bir ses bile canımı sıkıyor."
"Beş haftalık bir karanlık tünelin içindeymiş gibiyim, enerjim, motivasyonum ve iştahım tamamen kaybolmuş, her şey beni aşırı etkiliyor."
"Bu 5 haftalık süreçte sanki vücudum kendi içinde bir savaş veriyor gibi, enerjim, motivasyonum ve iştahım yok olmuş, her şeye karşı son derece hassasım."
"Beş haftalık bir enerji ve motivasyon kıtlığı yaşıyorum, iştahım tamamen kaybolmuş, her şeye karşı aşırı hassasiyet hissediyorum, sanki bir cam fanus içindeymiş gibi."
"Telefonumun sadece soruna katkıda bulunduğunu hissediyorum. Son zamanlarda aşırı yalnızlık nöbetleri yaşıyorum... Sadece fiziksel olarak çok fazla vergi alıyor. Birçok arkadaşımın kendi hayatlarıyla çok meşgul olduğunu hissediyorum; Diğerleriyle birlikte, kişiliklerimizin artık uyumlu olmadığı noktaya kadar çok değiştik. Beni çok fazla strese sokuyor. Biliyorum, bu yeni yolculuğum için zaman alacak, ancak nasıl bir etki yapacağım."
Telefonun benim için aslında bir yük gibi hissediyorum; Beni sosyalleşmekten ve arkadaşlarımla vakit geçirmekten alıkoyuyor.
"Teknolojinin sürekli olarak bizi dış dünyadan kopardığını, gerçek bağlantıları zorlaştırdığını düşünüyorum."
"Eskiden arkadaşlarımla sürekli görüşürdük, şimdi ise hayatlarımız o kadar farklılaştı ki, bağlantı kurmak çok zor."
"Artık kendimi eski arkadaşlarımın arasında yabancı gibi hissediyorum, sanki yıllardır birbirimizi tanımıyoruz."
"Bu yalnızlık hissi çok yıpratıcı, kendimi kimseye anlatamıyorum ve yalnız kaldığımı hissediyorum."
20'li yaşların başından beri PMDD'm var... Belirtilerim gece ve gündüz farkı oldu.
"PMDD ile hayatım 20'li yaşlarımın başından beri çok değişti, özellikle de gece ve gündüz arasında büyük farklar yaşıyorum."
20'li yaşlarımın başından beri PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum ve gece ve gündüz belirtilerim arasında çok büyük bir fark var.
PMDD'nin belirtileri 20'li yaşlarımın başından beri hayatımı etkiliyor ve gece ile gündüz arasında büyük farklılıklar yaşamaktayım.
"Gece ve gündüz arasında büyük farklılıklar yaşamama rağmen, 20'li yaşlarımın başından beri PMDD ile yaşıyorum."
"20'li yaşlarımın başından beri PMDD belirtileriyle mücadele ediyorum, gece ve gündüz farklı belirtilerle karşılaşıyorum."
"Çok yorgun / düşük enerji hissettim ve tuvalete çok daha fazla gittim (pooping), tuvalete gitmeden önce kramp ve ağrılı bir kafa"
"Çok yorgun hissettim, sanki tüm enerjim tükenmiş gibiydi ve aynı zamanda sürekli tuvalete gitme ihtiyacı duyuyordum."
"Normalden daha fazla tuvalete gitme ihtiyacı hissediyordum, ayrıca başım ağrıyordu ve vücudumda kramplar vardı."
"Yorgun ve halsiz hissediyordum ve bağırsaklarımın hareket etmesi çok sıklaşıyordu, ayrıca tuvalete gitmeden önce kramp ve baş ağrısı da oluyordu."
Kendimi çok yorgun hissettim ve tuvalete gitmeden önce mide krampları ve baş ağrısı da oluyordu.
"Çok yorgun ve düşük enerjiliydim,  tuvalete çok sık gitmem gerekiyordu ve gitmeden önce kramp ve baş ağrısı da çekiyordum."
Beyin sisi neden oldu bilmiyorum ya da uykusuzluktan ya da yorgunluktan fazla mı yoruldum bilmiyorum... Üzüldüm ve bunun için kendimi nasıl affedeceğimi bilmiyorum.
"Bugün hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sanırım beyin sisi çok yoğun. Yorgunluk da bunun üstüne tuz biber oldu."
"Duygusal olarak yıpranmış hissediyorum, sanki zihnimde bir sis var ve hiçbir şey net değil."
"Bedenim yorgun, beynim ise sisli. Ne yaptığımı bile bilmiyorum."
"Bu his çok kötü, kendimi affedemiyorum. Sanki beynim çalışmıyor ve yorgunluktan başka bir şey düşünmek istemiyorum."
"Bir türlü toparlanamıyorum, sanki beynim uykusuzluk ve yorgunluktan donmuş gibi. Kendime kızgınım, bu kadar kötü hissetmek istemiyorum."
"Bugün bacaklarımda, sırtımda ve başımda çok acı çekiyorum ve genel olarak bir yük gibi hissediyorum... Bugün çalışmaktan ve maskelemeden neredeyse sözsüzdüm"
"Bugün kendimi tamamen bitkin hissediyorum, sanki bütün gücümü kaybetmişim gibi."
"Bedenim ağırlaşmış, hareket etmek bile istemiyorum,  her yerim ağrıyor."
"Sanki bir hastalık geçirmiş gibiyim, tüm bedenim yorgun ve ağrılı."
"Kendimi o kadar kötü hissediyorum ki, sanki bir yük altındaymışım gibi."
"Bugün hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece yatağa uzanmak ve dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Süper depresif hissetmek ve beynimi kapatmak istiyorum... alabileceğim herhangi bir dopamin vuruşu arayın, ancak bazen kesinlikle hiçbir şey işe yaramaz. Alışveriş ve porno bağımlılığım da bu süre zarfında vahşidir... Kötü bir yerde olduğumda zihinsel olarak çok fazla porno izliyorum ve en kötü türdeki (cinsel) ilgiyi arıyorum."
"Depresif hissetmek gerçekten çok kötü, hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor gibi hissediyorum. Sadece beynimi kapatmak ve her şeyi unutmak istiyorum."
"Bazen kendimi aşırı derecede kötü hissediyorum, sanki içimdeki tüm enerji çekilmiş gibi. Hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor, sadece biraz rahatlama arıyorum."
"Bazen kendimi o kadar kötü hissediyorum ki, sadece her şeyi bırakıp kaçmak istiyorum. İnsanlar bana yaklaştığında bile,  her şeyi engellemek, dünyadan uzaklaşmak istiyorum."
"Bu durumla başa çıkabilmek için her şeyi denedim, ancak hiçbir şey işe yaramıyor. Sanki kendimle savaş halindeyim ve kaybetmek üzereyim."
"Kendimi boşlukta hissediyorum, sanki hiçbir şeyin anlamı yok. Sadece biraz mutluluk arıyorum, ama bu bile imkansız gibi geliyor."
"Görünüşümle mücadele ediyorum ve bir yeme bozukluğu geliştirdim.... Evden ayrılmak istemediğim noktaya kadar çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum.... Bana geçmişiyle ilgili söylediği şeyleri kendime karşı kullanıyorum, nasıl üçlüler yaptığı gibi, sürekli olarak nasıl yeterince iyi olabileceğimi ve neden benimle birlikte olmak istediğini merak ediyorum."
"Görünüşümle ilgili sorunlarım var ve bu da yeme bozukluğuna yol açtı, kendimi o kadar çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum ki evden çıkmak istemiyorum."
"Kendimle ilgili kötü hissediyorum ve bu da beni yeme bozukluğuna sürükledi, kendimi o kadar çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum ki evden çıkmak istemiyorum."
"Görünüşüm beni çok rahatsız ediyor ve bu da yeme bozukluğuna yol açtı, kendimi o kadar çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum ki evden çıkmak istemiyorum."
"Geçmişinde olan şeyleri bana hatırlatıyor, üçlüleri yaptığı gibi ve sürekli olarak neden benimle birlikte olduğunu ve yeterince iyi olup olmadığımı sorguluyorum."
Geçmişini sürekli bana hatırlatıyor ve bu da beni yeterince iyi olup olmadığımı sorgulatıyor ve neden benimle birlikte olduğunu merak ediyorum.
"Babam rahatsız edici düşüncelerle OKB'ye sahipti ve bir süredir nasıl hissettiği ve kontrolü dışında olan şeyler hakkında benimle konuşuyordu.... o gün tüm kıyafetlerini verdi, ortağına bir not bıraktı ve bunu yapmak için sahile gitti."
Babamın obsesif kompulsif bozukluğundan dolayı yaşadığı zorluklara tanık olmak beni derinden etkiliyordu ve artık bununla mücadele edemediğini hissetmişti.
Annesi onun OKB'siyle sürekli mücadele ettiğini ve son zamanlarda işleri bırakmaya karar verdiğini söyleyerek bu konuda bana açılmıştı.
"O gün, kardeşinin intihar girişiminden sonra kendisini anlamakta zorlandığını ve bunu bir süredir yaşadığını söyledi."
"Ablam, yıllarca travmatik bir olayı atlatamadığını ve kendisini tamamen kontrolsüz hissettiğini anlatarak beni endişelendirdi."
"İş arkadaşım, işindeki baskının artmasıyla birlikte bir süredir kendisini kötü hissettiğini ve durumu düzeltemeyeceğini söyleyerek, herkesi şaşkına çevirmişti."
"Adet sahnemden önceki 3d'de olduğu gibi sürekli hissetmek, kaygıyı eksiyor. Kolayca öfkelenmiş, huysuz, yorgun, mide bulandırıcı ve asabi."
"Sahne öncesinde her zaman aynı hisler, kaygı, huysuzluk, yorgunluk, mide bulantısı, asabiyet... Üstesinden gelmek zor."
"Performans öncesi sürekli aynı gerginlik, mide bulantısı, sinirlilik... Bu hislerle baş etmek çok yorucu."
"Sahneye çıkmadan önce hissettiğim kaygı ve sinirlilik, mide bulantısı ve yorgunluğa dönüşüyor. Bu hislerden kurtulmak imkansız."
"Kaygılarım beni sürekli yorgun, huysuz ve mide bulandırıyor. Sahne öncesi bu hislerle baş etmek zor."
"Her performans öncesi aynı hislerle boğuşuyorum: kaygı, huysuzluk, yorgunluk, mide bulantısı, asabiyet... Bu hisler beni tüketiyor."
"PMDD'nin düzensiz belirtileri yaşadım. Döneminiz boyunca MAJOR anksiyetesi ve panik atakları geçiriyorum. Sadece dönemim bittikten sonra daha iyi hissediyorum. Bunun sadece bir kez gerçekleşmesinden korkuyorum, çünkü semptomlarım dönemimden sonra gitmezse ne olur?"
PMDD'nin neden olduğu yoğun anksiyete ve panik ataklar beni gerçekten korkutuyor.
"Dönemlerimin sonrasında hissettiğim rahatlama, PMDD'nin beni ne kadar etkilediğini gösteriyor."
"PMDD semptomlarımın devamlılığı, günlük hayatımı olumsuz etkiliyor."
Dönemlerim dışında normal hissedebilmek için PMDD tedavisine ihtiyacım olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Semptomlarımın sadece bir dönemle sınırlı kalacağını umuyorum, çünkü devam etmeleri durumunda çok zorlanacağım."
Düşünceler gerçekten çok hızlı gidiyor ve çok fazla fikrim var ve hepsini yapmak istiyorum. Anlam veremiyorum.
"Düşüncelerim sürekli akıyor, her an yeni fikirler geliyor, hepsini hayata geçirmek istiyorum ama nasıl yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Zihnimde bir sürü fikir dolanıyor, her biri bir diğerinden daha cazip, hangisini önce yapacağımı bilemiyorum."
"Aklımda o kadar çok şey var ki, hepsini yapmak isterdim ama kendimi bunalmış hissediyorum."
"Yaratıcılığım sınır tanımıyor, sürekli yeni fikirler üretiyorum, ama hepsini gerçekleştirmek imkansız."
"Düşüncelerim sürekli bir akış halinde, o kadar çok fikrim var ki, nereden başlayacağımı bilemiyorum."
"Kendimi çok dışlanmış hissediyorum. Gece yarısı sindirim sorunlarıyla kusuyordum ve uyuyamıyordum. Adetime kadar 6 günüm var, bu yüzden şu anda benim için gerçekten zor. Beynim çalışmıyor. Kendim değilim... Çok aşağıyım. Birini eğlendirmeyi ya da seks yapmayı hayal edemiyorum."
Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Her şey beni üzüyor ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum.
Bu günlerde çok yalnız ve mutsuz hissediyorum. Sanki dünya sırtımı dönmüş gibi.
Her şeyden bıktım. İstediğim tek şey uyuyabilmek ve bu kötü hislerden kurtulmak.
Sanki her şey benim başıma geliyor. Neden hep ben?
Ağır bir yük hissediyorum. Sanki tüm dünyanın yükünü ben çekiyormuşum gibi.
Bu kısa vadede anti-depresanları kullanmaya aşina değilim.
Kısa vadede anti-depresan kullanımı konusunda deneyimim yok.
Anti-depresanların kısa süreli kullanımıyla ilgili bilgili değilim.
"Bu konuda uzmanlaşmış değilim, ancak kısa vadeli anti-depresan kullanımına aşina değilim."
Kısa vadeli anti-depresan kullanımı hakkında bilgim sınırlı.
"Kısa vadeli anti-depresan kullanımını önermiyorum, çünkü bu konuda yeterince bilgi sahibi değilim."
"Çok rahatsızım, ağlamak istiyorum... çok rahatsızım."
"Çok üzgünüm, kendimi kötü hissediyorum ve sadece ağlamak istiyorum."
"Kendimi gerçekten kötü hissediyorum, ağlamak dışında başka bir şey yapamıyorum."
"Bu kadar kötü hissettiğimde ağlamak istiyorum, kendimi daha iyi hissetmemi sağlayacak tek şey bu."
"Çok yorgunum ve üzgünüm, sadece ağlamak istiyorum."
"Ağlamaktan başka çarem yok, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Her gün maskelemek ve tamamen kopana kadar iyiymişim gibi davranmak için hissettiğim baskı nefes alamıyorum. Kronik endometriozis ağrısı, DEHB ve PMDD ile acı çekiyorum. Bazı günler, nasıl devam edeceğimi bilmeme konusundaki intihar fikrim çok fazla olacak ve kendimi korkutuyorum."
"Her gün bir maske takmak ve iyiymiş gibi yapmak çok yorucu, ruhumu ezmekten vazgeçemiyorum."
"Sürekli olarak kronik endometriozis ağrısı, DEHB ve PMDD'nin acılarıyla boğuşuyorum, bu da beni umutsuzluğa sürüklüyor."
"Bazı günler, nasıl devam edeceğimi bilmeme konusundaki çaresizlik çok fazla geliyor ve kendimi intihar düşüncesine kapılıyorum."
"Benim için her gün bir savaş, hastalıklarımı saklamaya çalışmak ve dışarıdan güçlü görünmek için sürekli bir çaba."
"Bu hastalıklar beni ruhsal olarak yıpratıyor, var olma amacımı sorguluyorum ve bazen sadece her şeyin bitmesini diliyorum."
"Sağ göğsümde bir yumru ve ağrı var. Çarşamba günü bunun için ultrasonum var. Zihnimin en karanlık kısımlarında, umarım kanserdir, böylece bu hayattan kurtulabilirim. Ya da en azından bu kadar acı çekmek için bir çeşit fiziksel sebebi var."
"Sağ göğsümdeki yumru büyüyor, artık ağrı da başladı. Doktor randevusu için günlerdir bekliyorum, ama sanırım tüm bunlar boşuna."
"Bu ağrı artık dayanılmaz hale geldi. İnsanlar bana 'stres' diyorlar, ama bu ağrının bir sebebi olması gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"Doktora gitmekten korkuyorum. Bana kötü bir haber vereceğinden korkuyorum. Aynı zamanda, bana ne olduğuna dair bir açıklama getirmesini istiyorum."
Bu ağrı beni çıldırtıyor. İnsanlar beni anlamıyor. Hayatımın bu kadar acı içinde geçmesi tuhaf.
"Bazen bu ağrının benim için bir anlamı olmasını umuyorum. Sanki kötü bir şeyin, bir hastalığın, daha büyük bir sebebi varmış gibi."
YAŞAMIN ZORUNLU OLDUUNU BEKLEYİN YAŞAMIN KARŞILAŞTIRILMASI SALADIM MI????
"Yaşam zorlu bir yolculuk, bunu kabul etmeliyiz."
"Hayatın karşılaştırmalarla dolu olduğunu biliyorum, ama neden bu kadar üzüldün?"
"Yaşamın iniş çıkışları var, bunlara hazırlıklı olmalıyız."
Hayatın sunduğu zorlukları kabullenmeliyiz.
"Yaşamın zorlukları, onu daha anlamlı hale getiriyor."
"Progesteronu almak zorunda kaldığımda... ilk başta o kadar da kötü değil ama gerçek bir yaşayan zombi gibi, çalışamadı. Sonra tüm sırtım kırılıyormuş gibi şimdiye kadarki en kötü kramplar. Şimdi lutealin sonundayım ve aslında aklımı kaybediyormuşum gibi hissediyorum, oldukça korkutucu."
"Progesteron kullanmaya başladığımda kendimi sürekli yorgun ve uyuşuk hissediyorum, tam bir zombi gibi."
"İlaçların yan etkileri gerçekten çok kötü, bir süre sonra vücudumda garip ağrılar ve kramplar başladı."
"Bu luteal fazda sanki aklım başımdan gitmiş gibi hissediyorum, kontrolsüz bir şekilde duygusal değişimler yaşıyorum."
"Hormonal dengesizliklerin en kötü yanı ruh halindeki ani değişimler ve endişe duygusu, gerçekten dayanılmaz."
"Bu ilaçlarla başa çıkmak zor, yan etkilerden kurtulmak için ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
Şu anda kanamamın 4. günündeyim ve bugün hala çok duygusalım. Onun için bir oyun olduğunu ve zamana ya da genel olarak sadece bana saygı duymadığını fark etmeye başladım. Biraz kızgınım. Biraz üzücü.
"Bu ayın adet döneminde çok zor bir dönemden geçiyorum, çok duygusalım."
"İlişkinin başında onun kadar beni önemsemediğini fark etmeye başladım, gerçekten beni önemsemiyor."
Bazen gerçekten bana saygı duymadığı düşüncesiyle içimde bir öfke birikmeye başlıyor.
"İlişkinin geleceği hakkında endişeliyim, çünkü o benim duygularımı ve ihtiyaçlarımı yeterince önemsemiyor."
Kendimi duygusal olarak çok yorgun hissediyorum ve bu durumun bir çözüme kavuşması için bir şeyler yapmam gerektiğini hissediyorum.
"Bir hafta önce aşağıdaki semptomları yaşıyorum: Akne, Sıcak sifonlar, Sinirlilik, Şiddetli şişkinlik, Çok şişmiş / gergin göğüsler, Eklem ağrısı, Öfke / kısa temperli, Aşırı aşırı düşünceli, Rahatsız edici düşünceler, İştahta değişiklik, Yorgunluk / motivasyonsuz, Anksiyete, Ani gözyaşı / mutsuzluk, Gece yaklaşan kıyamet hissi, Bir göreve yapışamam"
"Son bir hafta içinde kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, akne, sıcak basmaları, sinirlilik gibi belirtilerle boğuşuyorum."
"Geçtiğimiz haftadan beri akne, sıcak basmaları, sinirlilik, şişkinlik, göğüslerde şişlik gibi bir sürü rahatsızlık yaşıyorum."
"Bir hafta önce başlayan akne, sıcak basmaları, sinirlilik, şişkinlik, göğüslerde şişlik, eklem ağrısı, öfke, aşırı düşünceler, iştah değişikliği, yorgunluk, anksiyete, ani gözyaşı, gece kıyamet hissi gibi belirtilerle mücadele ediyorum."
"Bu belirtiler bir hafta önce başladı: akne, sıcak basmaları, sinirlilik, şişkinlik, şişmiş göğüsler, eklem ağrısı, öfke, aşırı düşünceler, iştah değişikliği, yorgunluk, anksiyete, ani gözyaşı, gece kıyamet hissi, bir göreve yapışamamak."

"Döngüsel aşırı pms/pmdd. Son 3 ay 40 yaşından beri dayanılmaz oldu. Hives, bulantı, kramplar... depresyon, ağlama büyüleri, paranoya ve herhangi bir hafif öfke beni her ay bir döngü için atıyor."
"Son 3 aydır hayatım PMS/PMDD ile çekilmez bir hal aldı, 40 yaşından sonra daha da kötüleşti."
"Her ay döngüm başladığında kurdeşenler, bulantı, kramplar, depresyon, ağlama nöbetleri, paranoya ve aşırı sinirlilik beni mahvediyor."
"40 yaşından sonra PMS/PMDD'nin şiddeti dayanılmaz bir hal aldı, her ay aynı döngüye girmekten bıktım."
"Kurdeşenler, bulantı, kramplar ve ruh halimdeki iniş çıkışlar beni her ay aynı döngüye mahkum ediyor."
"Depresyon, ağlama nöbetleri ve paranoya beni her ay PMS/PMDD'nin pençesinde esir alıyor."
"Doğum kontrolünden çıkmak, 2-4 ay sonra tam anlamıyla depresyona ve endişeye geri dönmemi sağladı."
Doğum kontrolünü bıraktıktan sonraki 2-4 ay içinde ruh halimde önemli bir kötüleşme yaşadım.
"Doğum kontrolünden çıkmak, eski depresyon ve kaygı belirtilerimin geri dönmesine neden oldu."
Doğum kontrolünü bırakmak ruhsal sağlığımı olumsuz etkiledi ve 2-4 ay sonra depresif ve endişeli hissetmeye başladım.
Doğum kontrolünü bıraktıktan sonra 2-4 ay içinde duygusal olarak daha dengesiz ve mutsuz hissetmeye başladım.
"Doğum kontrolünü bırakmamın beklenmedik bir sonucu, 2-4 ay sonra artan depresyon ve kaygı seviyelerimdi."
Bir spiralin içine giriyorum. Değer verdiğim her şeyi sabote etmeme yardımcı olacak bir şey arıyorum. Ortağım her ay saçmalıklarımla uğraşmak zorunda ve bundan bıkıyor ve kırgınlaşıyormuş gibi hissediyorum. Her ay işte şıklıyorum ve bırakmak istiyorum ve / veya bir şey için kızgın oluyorum ya da pişman olduğum bir şey söylüyorum.
"Çalışmalarımın beni ne kadar yorup tükettiğini hissediyorum, sanki bir spiralin içine doğru çekiliyor gibiyim."
"Değer verdiğim her şeye zarar veren bir şey arıyorum, kendimi durduramıyorum."
"Ortağım benimle olan bu döngüye katlanmak zorunda, onun sabrını zorluyorum."
"Her ay aynı şeyi tekrarlıyorum, işten ayrılmayı düşünüyorum ya da bir şeylere kızıyorum, bir şeylere pişman oluyorum."
"Bir çıkış yolu bulamıyorum, kendimi bir spiralin içinde sıkışmış gibi hissediyorum."
CPTSD donma tepkim maksimuma kadar aktiftir. Donma tepkisi benim ana ipucum hella anksiyetesi ve ayrışmasıdır. Sadece vücuduma girmeye çalışmak gibi. 7/24 duyusal aşırı yüklenmeye dayanamıyorum. Daha fazla yazabilirim ama yoğun olarak ayrışmaya başlarım. Bu izolasyonu kırmak istesem bile insanlara mesaj atamıyorum veya bir konvonun çoğunu tutamıyorum.
"CPTSD donma tepkim, anksiyete ve ayrışma ile kendini gösteriyor."
Kendimi aşırı yüklenmeden korumak için çok zorluyorum.
"Donma tepkisi, çevremdeki dünyadan kopmamı sağlayan bir savunma mekanizması gibi."
Bu yoğun duyusal aşırı yüklemenin başa çıkması çok zor.
"Sosyal etkileşimlerde bulunmak, duyusal aşırı yükleme nedeniyle çok yorucu."
"7 yıl önce pmdd teşhisi kondu... Hala genel olarak perişanım... Düzenli akneden bahsetmiyorum, yani teknik olarak akne bile değiller... Yorgunum... Bundan çok nefret ediyorum."
7 yıl önce pmdd teşhisi konduktan sonra hala kendimi kötü hissediyorum. 
"Bu pmdd hayatımı mahvediyor, hala bununla mücadele ediyorum. "
Her ay gelen bu semptomları daha fazla kaldırabileceğimden emin değilim. 
Yorgunluğum ve aknemden çok mutsuzum. 
Umarım bir gün pmdd'den kurtulabilirim. 
"O kadar çok insan var ki, mantıksal olarak, muhtemelen ne kadar sıklıkla intihara meyilli olduğumuza veya ölmeye çalıştığımıza göre ölmeli."
"Bu kadar çok insan varken, kendimizi yok etme olasılığımız, hayatta kalma olasılığımızla orantılı olmalı."
"Mantıksal olarak, bu kadar kalabalık bir dünyada, kendimizi yok etme eğilimimizin daha yüksek olması gerekir."
"İstatistiksel olarak, bu kadar çok insanla, intihar oranımızın daha yüksek olması beklenir."
"Bu kadar çok insan varsa, muhtemelen ölüme olan eğilimimiz de daha yüksek olmalı."
"Bu kadar kalabalık bir dünya düşünürsek, intihar oranımızın da daha yüksek olması beklenir."
"Çok çirkin, büyük ve iğrenç hissediyorum. Sadece DIŞARI! Çok fazla yer kaplıyormuşum gibi.... On farklı saç stili ve on beş farklı kıyafet denemek, sadece çirkin, iğrenç, iğrenç hissetmek ve her şeye kızgın olmak çok zor."
Bu kadar çok seçeneğin içinde kaybolmak beni sinirlendiriyor. Sanki bir sürü saçma kıyafet ve saç modeliyle uğraşmak zorunda kalıyorum ve bunun sonucunda da kendimi çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum.
Kendimi çirkin ve iğrenç hissetmek çok sinir bozucu. Bir sürü kıyafet ve saç stili denedim ama hiçbir şey hoşuma gitmiyor.
Sanki hiçbir şey bana uymuyor gibi hissediyorum. Tüm bu saç stilleri ve kıyafetler bana sadece çirkin ve iğrenç hissettiriyor.
Şu anda kendimi çok çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum. Sanki bu kadar çok seçenek arasında kayboluyorum ve hiçbir şey hoşuma gitmiyor.
Bu kadar çok seçeneğin içinde kaybolmak beni gerçekten yoruyor. En sonunda sadece kendimi çirkin ve iğrenç hissediyorum.
"Hem 6 yıl önceki ilk eklemem hem de değiştirmemle travmatize oldum. İyi olduğunu bilsem de ağlamaktan çok utanıyorum. Soğuk algınlığım vardı ve çok terliyordum. Otoparka kustum, eve geldim ve iki saat uyudum. Geri dönüşler yapmaya devam ediyorum ve kendimi çok ihlal edilmiş hissettiğim için kıvrılıp ağlamak istiyorum."
"Kendimi aşırı kötü hissediyorum, bu durum beni çok üzüyor, ağlamaktan kendimi alamadım."
"İnsanlar beni anlamakta zorlanıyor, oysa ben çok acı çekiyorum."
"Geçmişte yaşadığım kötü anılar beni halen etkiliyor, bunu anlatmak çok zor."
"Bir türlü unutamıyorum, sürekli olarak aynı şeyleri yaşıyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu durumu nasıl atlatacağımı bilmiyorum, kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum."
"İlk erkek arkadaşımdan (güvensiz ve biraz fetişist bir kombinasyon) ayrıldığım için yaşlar boyunca kendime işkence ettim, ancak bu kez beni sürekli aradığında hayal edilemez miktarda öfke hissettiğimde, baraj bozuldu ve ertesi sabah ondan ayrıldım."
"Uzun yıllar boyunca eski sevgilimin, güvensiz ve biraz fetişist bir kombinasyon olan, bana yaptığı davranışlar yüzünden kendimi suçladım, ancak bu sefer beni sürekli aradığında, içimde bir öfke dalgası esti ve her şeyi bitirmek için kararlı hale geldim."
"Geçmişte onun güvensiz ve fetişist tavırlarına rağmen, ona karşı hep bir suçluluk hissettim. Ama bu sefer, beni durmadan aradığında, içimde bir yangın başladı ve artık dayanamayacağımı anladım."
"Önceki ilişkim, hem güvensizlik hem de fetişist eğilimlerle doluydu, ve bu yüzden kendimi hep suçlu hissettim. Fakat bu sefer, beni sürekli arayarak rahat bırakmadığında, tüm bunlara dayanamayacağımı fark ettim ve sonunda ayrıldım."
"Eski sevgilim, güvensizliğin ve fetişist eğilimlerin garip bir karışımıydı, ve uzun yıllar boyunca bu ilişkinin bana verdiği zararı kendime mal ettim. Ama bu sefer, beni sürekli arayarak sinirlerimi bozduğunda, artık dayanamayacağımı anladım."
"Onun güvensizliği ve fetişist eğilimleri ilişkimizde hep vardı, ve ben bunu hep onun hatası olarak gördüm. Ancak bu sefer, beni durmadan arayarak rahatsız ettiğinde, artık dayanamayacağımı ve ilişkiyi bitirmem gerektiğini anladım."
Bir şey yapmak neredeyse imkansız geliyor. Tek yapabildiğim telefonuma akılsızca kaydırmak ya da duvara bakmak.
"Yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yokmuş gibi hissediyorum, tamamen çaresizim."
"Her şey çok zor hissediyor, enerjim bile yok."
Yapılacak bir şey olmadığını düşünmek beni gerçekten bunaltıyor.
İstediğim tek şey bir şeyleri değiştirmek ama hiçbir şey yapamıyorum.
"Benim için bir çözüm yokmuş gibi hissediyorum, her şey çok büyük."
"Deli hissediyorum. Dün yemek yiyemediğim için çok üzüldüm ve sonra sindirimim bugün bir enkazdı. Şimdi tüm güvensizliklerimi ve şikayetlerimi bir milyon artırıyor. Normalde mutlu ve ilişki sağlıklı olsa da, dün gece ilişkimi neredeyse iptal ettim. Hepsi PMDD'm çok daha kötü hale geldi. Her zaman bu rahatsız edici düşüncelere sahibim ama bu sefer onları kontrol edemedim ve sadece zonkluyordum."
"Dün geceden beri kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, normalde çok mutluyum ama bugün her şey beni çok üzüyor."
"Dün gece çok kötü bir yemek yedim ve bugün bunun ağır bedelini ödüyorum, ayrıca duygusal olarak da çok kötü bir dönemdeyim."
"Kendimi kontrol edemediğim bir dönemde, güvensizliklerim beni ele geçiriyor ve sanki kendim değilim gibi hissediyorum."
"Bugün hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor, her şey beni sinirlendiriyor ve kendimi çok kötü hissetmeme neden oluyor."
PMDD'm çok kötüleşmiş gibi hissediyorum ve bu da tüm güvensizliklerimi ve olumsuz düşüncelerimi yüzeye çıkarıyor.
"O kadar derin depresyon, endişeli ve sinirli hissettim ki, belki bir iki gün boyunca. Bazen bir hafta kadar.... Bir karakterin kafasından buhar çıktığı için çok sinirleneceği karikatürlerden biri gibi hissettim. Anneme bağırıyordum.... Depresyonun çok derin hissetmesini umursamadım ve yaşayacağım öfkenin bile beni bir şeyleri kıracağım ve kendime zarar vereceğim noktaya göndereceğini hissettim."
"Hayatımın o kadar kötü bir döneminden geçiyordum ki, gerçekten hiçbir şey yapmaktan zevk alamıyordum. Kendimi tamamen boşlukta gibi hissediyordum."
"O kadar stresliydim ki, neredeyse çığlık atıp bir şeyler kırmak istedim. Her şey beni sinirlendirdi, sanki vücudumun içinde bir yangın var gibi."
Kendimi çaresiz ve umutsuz hissediyordum. Sanki dünyanın yükü benim omuzlarıma binmiş gibiydi.
"En yakınlarımla bile iletişim kurmakta zorlanıyordum. Sinirlerim bozulmuş, öfkeli ve aşırı tepkiliydim."
"O kadar kötü hissediyordum ki, sanki kendimden geçmiş gibiydim. Hayatıma, kendime ve çevremdekilere karşı tamamen kayıtsız kalmıştım."
"ruh hali değişikliği (""ama dün çok mutluydun ve çok iyi hissediyordun"") ve yüzüm bile farklı görünüyor"
"Bugün gerçekten farklı hissediyorum, sanki dünki ben değilim."
"Sanki bir anda değiştim, dün neşeliydim bugün ise yorgunum."
"Bir şeylerin ters gittiğini hissediyorum, enerjim tamamen düştü."
"Dün her şey yolundaydı, bugün ise her şey gri görünüyor."
Ruh halimdeki bu ani değişim beni korkutuyor.
"Ben sadece deli ruh hali swings olsun ve normal genç şekilde değil. d!e çok sinir bozucu bir şekilde istiyorum. Şimdi belirtilerim sadece 10 gün boyunca tamamen kenarda olduğum ve çok yorucu olduğu gibi tezahür ediyor gibi görünüyor. Stresli, endişeli ve depresif uyanıyorum ve o zaman neden sadece DWELL olduğunu anlayamıyorum."
"Sadece ruh halim çok dalgalı, normal gençlik gibi değil. Çok sinir bozucu bir şekilde hissediyorum."
"Normal bir genç gibi değil, sürekli bir ruh hali dalgalanması yaşıyorum ve bu durum beni oldukça sinirlendiriyor."
"Ruh halim normal bir gencinki gibi değil, sürekli iniş çıkışlar yaşıyorum ve bu çok sinir bozucu."
"Bu ruh hali değişimleri normal bir gençlik dönemi davranışı değil, beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor."
"Sadece ruh halim çok iniş çıkışlı, normal bir gençlik dönemi gibi değil ve bu durum oldukça rahatsız edici."
Neredeyse iki yıl boyunca adetimi kaybettim. Adetimi yeni aldım ve çok garip olmaya başladı. Şimdi 18 yaşındayım ve bugün tekrar başladım. Bu ay üçüncü kez oluyor.
İki yıldır adet görmemiştim. Yeni başladı ve oldukça garip. 18 yaşındayım ve bugün yine başladı. Bu ay üçüncü kez oluyor.
"Adet görmeyi bırakalı neredeyse iki yıl oldu. Sonunda geri geldi, ama çok farklı. 18 yaşındayım ve bugün yine başladı. Bu ay üçüncü kez oluyor."
"Neredeyse iki yıldır adet görmüyordum, şimdi tekrar başladı ve çok garip. Henüz 18 yaşındayım ve bugün tekrar başladı. Bu ay üçüncü kez."
"Adet görmemiştim, neredeyse iki yıldır. Sonunda başladı ve çok garip. Şimdi 18 yaşındayım ve bugün tekrar başladı. Bu ay üçüncü kez."
İki yıla yakın bir süredir adet görmemiştim. Şimdi yeniden başladı ve çok garip. 18 yaşındayım ve bugün yine başladı. Bu ay üçüncü kez.
"Sadece aşağı ve dışarı ve jump için hazırdım... Şimdi kendimi ne kadar dramatik olduğum konusunda çok kötü hissediyorum, muhtemelen sadece bana daha iyi bakmam gerektiğinde."
"Hayatın bana attığı her şeyi karşılamaya hazırım, ama bu kadar aşırı tepki vermeyi bırakmam gerekiyor."
"Tek istediğim buraya gelmek ve eğlenmek, ama her şeyde abartılı tepkiler veriyorum."
"Sıkıntılarımı atıp kendimi bırakmak istiyorum, ama bu kadar dramatik olmaktan kendimi alamıyorum."
"Her şeyi yoluna koymak ve yol almaya devam etmek istiyorum, ama kendimi ne kadar dramatik olduğumu düşününce moralim bozuluyor."
"Hayatın beni ne kadar zorlarsa zorlasın ben her şeye hazırım, ama bu dramatik tavrımı bırakmam gerek."
"Kendimi, sahip olduğum olumsuz düşünce ve duyguların gerçekten gerçek olmadığına ikna etmekte zorlanıyorum... Olumlu kalmakta ve öfkemi kendime ve partnerime yerleştirmemekte zorlanıyorum."
"Olumsuz düşüncelerimi bastırmakta, her şeyi daha pozitif bir şekilde görmekte çok zorlanıyorum."
"Kendimi sürekli olarak olumsuzluk batağında buluyorum, onlardan kurtulmak için mücadele ediyorum."
"Olumlu düşünmeye çalıştıkça, içimdeki öfke ve olumsuzluk beni ele geçiriyor gibi."
"Öfkemi kontrol altında tutmak, partnerime olan sevgimi ve saygımı korumak için büyük bir çaba harcıyorum."
"Kendimi olumsuz düşüncelerden arındıramadığım zamanlar, partnerime de yansıyor, bu da beni daha da endişelendiriyor."
Kendimden nefret ediyorum. Devam etmek için 0 iyi nedenim var. Yaşadığım her yeri yok ediyorum. Yardıma ihtiyacım var.
Yaşamaya değer hiçbir şey göremiyorum.
Hiçbir umudum kalmadı.
Bütün bunları bırakıp gitmek istiyorum.
Kendimi bu şekilde hissetmemeliyim.
Bana bir yol gösteren biri olmalı.
"Her zaman, toplumun değişmek yerine beni rahatsızlığımla karşılaması gerektiğini düşündüğüm bir dönemim vardır. Ama mesele şu ki, ayın iki haftası boyunca münzevi olmak ve öfkeyi ifade etmek normal toplumla iyi bir şekilde birleşen şeyler değildir."
"Bir zamanlar, toplumsal değişimle değil, kendi içsel rahatsızlıklarımla mücadele etmem gerektiğini düşünüyordum."
"Kendime sürekli olarak 'Beni değiştirmeyecek, sadece beni olduğu gibi kabul edecek bir toplum' diye söylüyordum."
"Yalnızlığın ve öfkenin, bir toplumsal uyum içerisinde yaşamın gerektirdiği şeylerle nasıl bağdaşacağını hiç anlayamadım."
"Bir süre kendimi, toplumun beni anlamak zorunda olduğuna inandırdım, ancak kendi içinde tuttuğum öfkeyi ifade etmek, toplumsal beklentilerle nasıl uyuşabilirdi ki?"
"Beni rahatsız eden şeylerin, toplumun benim için değişmesi gerektiği fikrini beslediğini hissediyordum, ancak kendimi toplumdan izole ederek nasıl uyum sağlayabilirdim?"
"PMDD ile mücadele ettim, en kötü naturopath'ım görmeyi iddia ediyor. Batı tıbbı, doğum kontrolü, kitaplardaki her anti-depresan teklif edildi. Denenmiş doğal ilaçlar, morina karaciğeri yağı, akşam primrose, vitex. Progesteronu düzenlemekte zorlandığım için hepsine tepki gösterdim. Dönemimdeki çılgın şeylerden kendimi konuşturmak, hayatı etkilemek, vb."
"PMDD'nin ne kadar zorlayıcı olduğunu ve deneyimlediğim tüm tedavilerin sonuçsuz kaldığını, doğal çözümlerden batı tıbbına kadar her şeyi denediğimi hissediyorum."
"Doğum kontrolü, anti-depresanlar, doğal ilaçlar... hiçbir şey PMDD'nin etkisini durduramadı. Hayatımı derinden etkiliyor, özellikle de dönemim sırasında."
"Her tedaviyi denedim, ancak PMDD semptomları hala beni kontrol ediyor. Sanki vücudumla bir savaş veriyorum ve kaybediyorum."
"Bu PMDD'nin neden olduğu şiddetli duygu değişimlerine nasıl katlanacağımı bilmiyorum. Her şeyden önce, dönemimde kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"Her şeyini denediğimi hissediyorum, ama hala bir cevap bulamıyorum. Bu PMDD, benim için sürekli bir mücadele."
"Adetimden 10 gün önce semptomlarım başlayacak. Yoğun ruh hali dengesizliği, artan kaygı, aşırı korku, sinirlilik, öfke, yorgunluk, vb."
"Adet dönemimden önceki günlerde kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Sinirli, endişeli ve yorgun oluyorum, sanki her şey beni üzer gibi."
Adet dönemime yaklaşırken kontrolü kaybettiğimi hissediyorum. Sanki duygularım bir düğmeye basılmış gibi değişiyor.
Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum. Sadece adet dönemim geçmesini bekliyorum.
"Bu dönemlerde normalden daha fazla uyuma ihtiyacım var, aksi takdirde işlevsiz hale geliyorum."
"Her ay aynı şeyi yaşıyorum. Adet dönemime yaklaşırken kontrolümü kaybediyorum, sinirli ve gergin oluyorum, her şey beni üzüyor."
"İpimin ucunda olduğumu hissediyorum, pmdd ile dibe vurdum. İlişkimi büyük ölçüde pmdd nedeniyle kaybettim. Dört aydır terör vardı ve bu pmdd turu en kötüsünü hissediyor. İşi kaçırıyorum ve çok derinden acı veren ağlama büyülerine sahibim.. Güçlü intihar arzusunu sarsamıyorum. Bir destek grubu olmadan tamamen yalnızım. ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"PMDD'nin beni tam olarak ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum, hiç bu kadar kötü olmamıştım."
"Her şey çöküyor, bu PMDD turu beni tamamen alt etti."
"İlişkimde, işimde, kendimde her şey mahvoldu. Bu durumdan nasıl çıkacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Bu PMDD atakları çok ağır geçiyor, sanki hayatımın kontrolünü tamamen kaybetmişim gibi hissediyorum."
Kendimi derin bir uçuruma doğru sürükleniyor gibi hissediyorum ve bu PMDD'nin beni oraya götürdüğünü düşünüyorum.
Dün gece banyomun zemininde hıçkırarak partnerime aslında hayatımı sevdiğimi ve ölmek istemediğimi anlatmaya çalışıyorum ama beynim aksini söylüyor.
"Partnerime içtenlikle duygularımı anlatmaya çalışıyorum ama beynim bana engel oluyor, dün gece banyoda hıçkırarak bunu dile getirdim."
"Duygusal çöküş yaşadım, partnerime aslında hayattan zevk aldığımı ve yaşamaya devam etmek istediğimi söylemek istedim ama beynim bana engel oldu."
"Dün gece banyoda partnerime hayatı sevdiğimi söylemeye çalıştım, beynim direniyordu, hıçkırıklarım duygu karmaşasını dışa vuruyordu."
"Partnerimle yaşadığım duygusal karışıklık, dün gece banyoda hıçkırarak hayatı sevdiğimi söylememe yol açtı, beynim ise aksi yönde düşünüyordu."
"Dün gece banyoda, içten duygularımı partnerime anlatmaya çalışırken beynim ters düşüyordu, hıçkırıklarımla hayatı sevdiğimi ve ölmek istemediğimi haykırıyordum."
Her zaman vücudumun beni öldürmeye çalıştığını düşünürüm.
Sürekli olarak vücudumun bana karşı savaştığını hissediyorum.
Vücudumun benimle bir savaş halinde olduğunu düşünüyorum.
Sanki kendi vücudum beni ele geçirmeye çalışıyor.
Vücudumun benim düşmanım olduğunu hissediyorum.
Her gün kendi bedenimle mücadele ediyorum.
bir anahtarın çevirmesi gibi devralan karanlık. Aydan aya bu ay yapmak yorucudur. Bu yıl 35 olacağım ve 5 ve 1 yaşlarında iki kızım olacak ve dua ediyorum ki bunu onlara aktarmıyorum. Bunu onlardan en iyi şekilde maskelemek her ay benden çok şey alıyor.
"Karanlık, bir anahtarın çevirmesi gibi yavaş yavaş üzerime çöküyor."
Her ay aynı şeyi yapmak beni tüketiyor.
"35 yaşına girmek üzereyim ve 5 yaşında ve 1 yaşında iki kızım var, umarım bu yorgunluğu onlara yansıtmadığım."
Kızlarımdan bu durumu en iyi şekilde gizlemek için her ay çok çaba harcıyorum.
"Bu karanlık, yavaş yavaş gelip beni ele geçiriyor gibi hissediyorum."
Çok yorucu.
"Çok yorgunum, biraz dinlenmem gerekiyor."
Bu iş beni çok yoruyor.
"Bugün çok koşturdum, bitap düştüm."
Yorgunluktan gözlerim kapanıyor.
Biraz daha çalışırsam bayılacağım.
O kadar zor ki
Bu iş gerçekten çok zor.
Başaramıyor olmamın nedeni bu kadar zor olması.
Bunu başarmak için çok çaba harcamam gerekecek.
Daha önce hiç bu kadar zor bir şeyle karşılaşmamıştım.
Umarım bu kadar zor olmadığı bir yolunu bulurum.
"Menopoza girdiğimden beri şiddetli depresyon geçiriyorum, bunun için ilaç almama rağmen."
Menopoza girdiğimden beri kendimi çok yorgun ve mutsuz hissediyorum.
Hormonal değişiklikler nedeniyle sürekli ruh halim değişiyor ve bu durum beni çok zorluyor.
İlaçlar bazı semptomları hafifletiyor ama genel olarak depresyonu atlatmamı kolaylaştırmadı.
"Menopozun bu kadar zorlu geçeceğini hiç düşünmemiştim, bu durum beni gerçekten yıktı."
"Bu dönemde kendimi yalnız ve çaresiz hissediyorum, bu durumla başa çıkmak çok zor."
Onları çok fazla hayal kırıklığına uğratıyormuşum gibi hissediyorum.
Onlara karşı çok fazla yükümlülük hissediyorum.
Onları sürekli olarak hayal kırıklığına uğrattığımı düşünüyorum.
Onları hayal kırıklığına uğrattığımı düşünerek kendimi kötü hissediyorum.
Onlara yeterince iyi davranmadığımı hissediyorum.
Onları memnun etmek için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalışıyorum ama yeterince iyi olmadığımı düşünüyorum.
"Sinir bozucu olan, lanet olası sorunun cevabını istediğinde her yerde ortaya çıkan intihar hattıdır."
"Sinir bozucu olan, işe yaramaz bir şekilde sürekli karşımıza çıkan o sinir bozucu problemdir."
Aradığım cevap için sürekli karşımıza çıkan o problem canımı sıkıyor.
"Canımı sıkan o problem, sorunun cevabını bulmak istediğimde her yerde karşımıza çıkıyor."
"Sürekli karşımıza çıkan o can sıkıcı problem, aradığım cevabı bulmamı engelliyor."
"Aradığım cevabı her yerde bulduğumda, o lanet olası problemle karşılaşıyorum."
"Bipolar teşhisi kondu, ancak yıllarca 'episodes'lerimi inceledikten ve izledikten sonra sağlayıcım PMDD tanısı ekledi. Bunu her ay yapmaktan çok yoruldum. Yorucu."
"Uzun zamandır bipolar olduğumu biliyorum, ama doktorum son zamanlarda PMDD teşhisi de koydu. Çünkü her ay aynı duygusal iniş çıkışları yaşıyorum, artık bu döngüden çok yoruldum."
"Bipolar teşhisi konduktan sonra, yıllarca yaşadığım ruh hali değişimlerinin sadece bipolarla açıklanamayacağını fark ettim. Doktorum sonunda PMDD'nin de var olduğunu söyledi ve bunu her ay yaşamak çok yorucu."
"Doktorun bipolar teşhisini uzun zamandır biliyorum, fakat doktorum yakın zamanda PMDD'yi de ekledi. Her ay aynı duygusal iniş çıkışlarını yaşamak gerçekten yıpratıcı."
"Bipolar teşhisim uzun zamandır var, ama doktorum son zamanlarda PMDD'nin de olduğunu söyledi. Her ay aynı yoğun duygusal iniş çıkışları yaşamak çok yorucu."
"Yıllarca bipolar teşhisiyle mücadele ettim, ama doktorum sonunda PMDD'nin de olduğuna karar verdi. Her ay aynı duygusal dalgalanmaları yaşamak gerçekten yıpratıcı."
Kafa karışıklığı ve öfkeyle felç oldum. Şu anda her şeye çok kızgınım.
"Her şeyden bıktım, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum."
"Duygularımın kontrolünü kaybettim, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Sinirlerim bozuldu, sakinleşemiyorum."
"Bu durum beni tamamen çıldırttı, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
Bu kadar çok şeyden bıktım ki sadece çığlık atmak istiyorum.
Bütün hafta yorgunluktan bayıldım... uykulu üzgün bir canavarın içinde birleşen luteal ve depresyon... böyle hissettiğimde spor salonuna daha az verimli gidemem.
"Bütün hafta yorgunluktan bayıldım, uykumdan uyanamadım... sanki bir depresif canavara dönüştüm."
"İçimde bir luteal faz ve depresyonun birleşimiyle uyuşukluk ve üzüntü var... Bu durumda, spor salonuna gitmek çok zor geliyor."
"Yorgunluktan uyuşuk, depresyondan üzgün... bu hissiyatla spor salonuna gitmek, canıma tak ediyor."
"Depresyon ve luteal fazın birleşimiyle, yorgunluk ve üzüntü beni sardı. Bu durumda, spor salonuna gitmek için hiçbir motivasyonum yok."
Bütün hafta bir uyuşukluk ve üzüntü içindeydim... sanki içimde bir depresyon canavarı yaşıyor. Spor salonuna gitmek için hiç gücüm yok.
"Duş almaz, vücudumu yıkamaz veya saçımı yıkamazdım. Bunların hiçbirini yapmak için çok az enerjim vardı.... Bunu çok uzun zamandır depresif ve hayatla ilgili hissetmedim.... Bu konuda konuştuğum için bile insanlara karşı bir yük gibi hissediyorum.... Adetimden iki hafta önce, yalnız hissetmekten bıktım."
"Kendimi çok yorgun ve depresif hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Bu hissi çok uzun zamandır yaşamıyorum, sanki hayatın tadı kaçmış gibi."
"Çevremdeki insanlara yük oluyormuş gibi hissediyorum, onlara derdimi anlatmaktan bile çekiniyorum."
"Her şeyden yorulduğumu hissediyorum, sanki hayatın rengi solmuş gibi."
"Kendimi yalnız ve umutsuz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapacak gücüm kalmamış gibi."
"Tatmin olmadan yiyorum, yiyorum ve yiyorum. Bu yüzden tıkınıyorum. Her şeyde ve her şeyde... Depresyonda olduğum için yiyorum. Hemen spor salonunu görmediğim veya sağlıklı bir ilerleme görmediğim için yiyorum. Bu hiç bitmeyen döngüde sıkışıp kaldım ve yardıma ihtiyacım var."
"Doymak bilmeden yiyorum, sürekli bir şeyler atıştırıyorum. Sanki kendimi yemeklerle avutuyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Depresyon beni tamamen ele geçirmiş gibi hissediyorum, kendimi sadece yemek yiyerek sakinleştirebiliyorum."
"Her gün aynı döngü: yiyip, suçluluk duyup, tekrar yiyip duruyorum. Bu durumdan nasıl çıkacağımı bilmiyorum."
Sağlıklı beslenmek ve spor yapmak için sürekli kendime söz veriyorum ama bir türlü başaramıyorum. Bu durum beni çok üzüyor.
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, yemek yemeye karşı dayanamam. Bu sürekli bir mücadele haline geldi."
"Yavaş yavaş başlar, zar zor fark edilir. Küçük tahrişler ve hayal kırıklıklarıyla başlar. Ama günler benim dönemime yaklaştıkça sis daha da ağırlaşır ve kalınlaşır. Bu öfkem, gözyaşlarım ve bitkinliğim daha da kötüleşir gibi görünüyor. Bir şeyleri düşürürüm ve kelimeleri bulamıyorum.... Benim dünyam altımdan parçalanıyormuş gibi geliyor. Vücudum düzgün çalışmıyor ve bir şeyleri düşürüyorum ve bir şeylere çarpıyorum."
"Bu zamanlar benim için her zaman zor geçer, başlangıçta farkedilmeyen küçük rahatsızlıklar ve hayal kırıklıkları ile başlar."
"Her şey çok yavaş başlar, sanki bir sis yavaşça üzerime çöküyor. "
"Daha da kötüleşiyor,  her geçen gün biraz daha fazla güçsüzleşiyorum."
"Bu dönemler bir fırtına gibi geliyor, en başta sadece hafif bir esinti, sonra giderek şiddetlenen bir kasırga."
"Çevrem bulanıklaşıyor, sanki bir sisin içine hapsolmuşum gibi hissediyorum."
"Gerçekliğe bağlı olmayan süper yoğun duygular hissedeceğim... Biri beni zincir testereyle kovalarsa ama aslında çalışmak için trende otursam da aynı miktarda endişe hissedeceğim. Ya da ailemle takılıyor olacağım ve bildiğim herkes ölmüş gibi kendimi çok üzgün hissedeceğim. Kafamda gerçek olmadığını biliyorum ama gerçekten de gerçek gibi geliyor, bu duyguları kontrol etmek için."
"Bazen hiçbir neden olmasa bile uçsuz bucaksız bir mutluluk duyuyorum, sanki dünyanın en şanslı insanıymışım gibi. Oysa sadece evde film izliyor oluyorum."
"Geçen gün sokakta yürürken ansızın başıma kötü bir şey gelmiş gibi hissettim. Çok korktum, sanki hayatım tehlikedeymiş gibi. Sonra kendime geldim, hiçbir şey olmamıştı."
"Bir anda evde yangın çıktığını hayal ettim ve inanılmaz korktum. Kalbim hızla çarpıyordu, sanki gerçekten yanıyormuşum gibi. Oysa sadece bir rüya gördüğümü fark ettim."
Sokakta yürürken eski bir arkadaşımı gördüm ve kendimi çok mutlu hissettim. Sanki yıllardır onu bekliyormuşum gibi. Sonra fark ettim ki aslında bir yabancıymış.
"Bazen kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum, sanki tüm dünya benimle ilgilenmiyor gibi. Herkesin beni terk ettiğini düşünüyorum. Oysa gerçekte sadece odamda oturuyor ve bilgisayar oynuyorum."
"PMDD'de, beyin kimyanız tehlikeye giren şeydir, bu yüzden en iyi yargınızı kullanmak her zaman bir seçenek değildir."
"PMDD'nin neden olduğu duygusal dalgalanmalar, mantıklı düşünmeyi zorlaştırabilir ve objektif kararlar almak zor olabilir."
"PMDD, ruh halinizi ve davranışınızı etkilediğinden, en iyi yargınızı kullanmak zorlaşabilir."
"PMDD'li kişilerde beyindeki kimyasal değişiklikler, düşünme ve karar verme yeteneğini etkileyebilir."
"PMDD, mantıksız düşünce ve davranışlara yol açabilir, bu da objektif karar vermeyi zorlaştırır."
"Hormonal dengesizlikler, PMDD'li kişilerde yargılama becerilerinde geçici değişikliklere neden olabilir."
"PMDD haftalarım boyunca, mantığımı düşüncelerime güvenmek için kullanamam. Mantık kısmı benim için başarısız olur. Kelimeleri veya söylediklerimi veya düşündüklerimi hatırlayamıyorum. Yani sadece PMDD olduğunu bilsem bile, düşüncelerime güvenemem. Sinirlenmelerim ve hislerim her zaman geçerlidir, PMDD sırasında bile, bu duygulara tepkim aşırı tepkidir."
"PMDD dönemlerinde, kendi düşüncelerimle mantık çerçevesinde hareket edemiyorum, mantığım beni yarı yolda bırakıyor."
"PMDD'nin etkisi altında kelimeleri, söylediklerimi veya düşüncelerimi hatırlamakta zorlanıyorum, bu da düşüncelerime güvenemeyeceğim anlamına geliyor."
"PMDD yaşadığımda, düşüncelerim çok yoğun ve karmaşık oluyor, bu yüzden mantıklı düşünmek veya kararlar almak neredeyse imkansız."
"PMDD'nin bana yaptığı en kötü şey, düşüncelerimi kontrol edememeyi ve mantıklı davranamamayı sağlamasıdır."
"PMDD sırasında, hissettiklerimin ve tepkilerimin mantık çerçevesinde olmadığını biliyorum, ancak bu duyguları kontrol edemiyorum."
"Kendi beynine güvenemeyeceğini hisset. intihar düşünceleri, sonsuz hayal kırıklığı"
"Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor."
"Hayatın anlamsız olduğunu düşünüyorum, neden devam etmeliyim?"
"Bu dünya benim için çok fazla, artık dayanamıyorum."
"İçime karanlık bir boşluk çökmüş, umutsuzluktan başka bir şey hissetmiyorum."
"Hayatımın hiçbir amacı yok, sanki boş bir kabuk gibiyim."
Hala her gün ağladım. Ve düşüncelerimi ayrıştırmak daha zordu. Ortağım gerçekten uzak mı davranıyor yoksa sadece nötr etkileşimlerden olumsuz şeyleri mi yorumluyorum? İçgüdülerime daha az güvenebilirim.
"Yaşadığım acıyla başa çıkmak çok zor, her gün ağlıyorum. Üstelik düşüncelerimi toparlamak da bir o kadar zor. Ortağım bana gerçekten soğuk mu davranıyor yoksa ben mi sürekli olumsuzluk arıyorum?"
"Bu son zamanlarda hissettiğim şeyler beni gerçekten korkutuyor. Her gün uyanıp ağlıyorum, duygularımı anlamak neredeyse imkansız. Acaba ortağım bana mesafeli mi davranıyor yoksa ben mi her şeyi yanlış yorumluyorum?"
"Bu durum beni tamamen tüketti, her gün ağlıyorum. Düşüncelerimi düzene koymaya çalışıyorum ama çok zor. Acaba ortağım beni uzaklaştırıyor mu yoksa ben mi sürekli olumsuz şeyler düşünüyorum?"
"Her geçen gün daha da kötüye gidiyorum, her gün ağlıyorum. Bu durumdan dolayı düşüncelerim karışık ve kendimi toparlayamıyorum. Ortağım bana uzak mı davranıyor yoksa ben mi gereksiz yere endişeleniyorum?"
"Bu yaşadığım durum beni tamamen çökertti, her gün ağlıyorum. Düşüncelerimi çözümlemekte zorlanıyorum. Ortağım bana gerçekten soğuk davranıyor mu yoksa ben mi onu yanlış anlıyorum?"
"Hayatınızın son derece üzgün ve umutsuz olmadığını, hormonlarınızın suçlandığını bilmek sizi üzgün ve umutsuz hissetmekten alıkoymaz."
Üzgün ve umutsuz hissetmeniz hormonlarınızın bir oyunu olsa bile bu hisler gerçek ve sizi etkiliyor.
"Hormonlarınızın suçlu olduğunu bilmek, kendinizi daha kötü hissetmenizi engellemiyor, çünkü üzgünlük ve umutsuzluk hala gerçek."
"Umutsuzluğunuzun geçici olduğunu bilmek, o anda hissettiğiniz acıyı azaltmıyor."
"Hormonlarınızın sizi üzgün ve umutsuz hissettirdiğini bilmek, bu hislerin gerçekliğini değiştirmez."
"Umutsuz hissetmeniz geçici olsa bile, bu hissi yaşamamak için bir çare yok."
Erkek arkadaşımın luteal'de bir yürüyüşte beni ormanda öldürmeyi planladığını sanıyordum. Pmdd'nin en kötüsünde mantık için çok daha az yer var.
"Erkek arkadaşımın beni terk edeceğini düşünüyordum, Pmdd'nin getirdiği şüpheler beni delirtiyordu."
"Bu kadar ağır bir gerçeği sadece ben mi hissediyorum, sanki sadece benim dünyamda böyle şeyler oluyor."
"Her şeyin sonunun geldiğini düşünüyordum, o anın yaşanmaması için ne yapacağımı bilmiyordum."
"O an için yaşadığım korku tarif edilemezdi, en kötü senaryoyu hayal ediyordum."
"Her şeyden çok kendimi yalnız hissediyordum, sanki kimse beni anlamıyordu."
"İyi arkadaşımın beni öldüreceğine ya da uzaylılar tarafından kaçırılacağıma ya da patronumun gerçekten bir nükleer savaş için kılık değiştirmiş bir hamamböceği olduğuna ikna olacağına inanırdım. Kulağa çok çılgınca geliyor, ama o durumdayken, hiçbirini anlam veremedim."
"Arkadaşımın bana bir komplo teorisini yutturabileceğine inanmak istemiyordum ama o zamanlar, deli saçması hikayelere açık olmuştum."
"İnanın, arkadaşımın bu tuhaf teorileri yutturabileceğine gerçekten inanıyordum, o zamanlar mantıklı bir şekilde düşünmekten yoksundum."
"Gerçekten arkadaşımın bu kadar çılgın fikirleri bana kabul ettireceğine inanıyordum, o zamanlar her şeye şüpheyle yaklaşıyordum."
"Arkadaşımın bu tuhaf inançlarını benimsediğimi düşünmek istemiyordum ama o zamanlar, gerçeklikten kopmuştum."
"Arkadaşımın beni inanılmaz hikayelere inandırtabileceğini düşünmek istemiyordum, çünkü o zamanlar, gerçeklikten uzaklaşmıştım."
"Ruh hali değişimleri, sinirlilik, öfke, hormonlardan kaynaklanan depresyon... beynim kısa devre moduna geçer... umutsuzluk hissi..."
"Hormonal dalgalanmaların getirdiği iniş çıkışlar, içimde fırtınalar koparıyor."
"Bir anda mutluluk, bir anda sinirlilik, bir anda umutsuzluk... Ruh halim bir uçtan bir uca savruluyor."
"Hormonların oynadığı oyunlar beni tam anlamıyla tüketiyor, bedenim ve zihnim bir savaş alanı gibi."
"Sanki beynimde bir düğmeye basılmış gibi, ani öfke patlamaları ve derin bir umutsuzluk duygusu üzerime çöküyor."
"Her gün değişen ruh halim, hayatımı bir kaos haline getiriyor, ne yapacağımı şaşırıyorum."
"Uzun süren ağlamamın hormonlarım yüzünden olduğunu biliyorum ama bir şekilde bu onu durdurabileceğim anlamına gelmiyor... Ve hormonlarım tarafından bu dev aşırı tepkime karşı şiddetlendirildiği bilgisi durumu daha da kötüleştiriyor. Çünkü kendimi neden bunu kapatamadığımı düşünerek azarlıyorum?... Ve sonra düşünüyorum, bu kadar hassasken bu dünyada nasıl hayatta kalabilirim? Ve ağlama devam ediyor çünkü hayatın her zaman bu kadar zor olacağını düşünüyorum."
"Duygusal olarak çok kırılgan olduğumu biliyorum, bu durumun hormonlarımla ilişkili olduğunu fark ediyorum ama bu beni daha az hassas yapmıyor. Aksine, bu duygusal dalgalanmaların hormonlar tarafından tetiklendiğini bilmek, kendimi daha kötü hissetmeme sebep oluyor."
"Ağlamamın hormonsal bir reaksiyon olduğunu anlıyorum, ama bu durumdan kendini sorumlu tutmak ve 'neden durduramıyorum?' diye düşünmek, kendini daha da kötü hissetmeni sağlıyor. Sürekli ağlamak, bu dünyada nasıl hayatta kalabileceğimi sorgulatan bir durum."
"Bu duygusal yoğunluğun hormonsal bir tezahürü olduğunu biliyorum, ancak bu gerçek beni rahatlatmıyor. Tersine, bu hassasiyetin vücudum tarafından kontrol edildiğini bilmek, kendimi daha da güçsüz hissetmeme sebep oluyor."
"Her şeyin çok zor olduğunu düşünmek, beni çok hassas yapıyor ve bu da sürekli bir ağlamaya neden oluyor. Bu duygusal dalgalanmaların hormonlarla bağlantılı olduğunu biliyorum ama bu durum beni rahatlatmıyor."
"Bu duygusal yoğunluğun hormonal kökenli olduğunu biliyorum, ancak bu durumun üstesinden gelemeyeceğim hissi beni daha da endişelendiriyor. Kendimi bu hassasiyete karşı savunmasız hissediyorum ve bu da sürekli bir ağlamaya neden oluyor."
"Tıpkı benim kayınpederimin, panik atak geçirirken çocuğumun mantıklı olmadığını söylemesi gibi."
"Tıpkı benim arkadaşımın, karısının onu sürekli eleştirdiğini söylemesi gibi."
"Tıpkı benim komşumun, evinin sürekli olarak ısındığını söylemesi gibi."
"Tıpkı benim öğretmenimin, sınavda başarısız olduğunu söylemesi gibi."
"Tıpkı benim patronumun, projenin zamanında bitmediğini söylemesi gibi."
"Tıpkı benim babamın, evde çok fazla gürültü olduğunu söylemesi gibi."
Kaşıntıyı düşünerek tüketileceğim. Sinirliyim... Aşırı intihar düşüncesi yaşıyorum. Hiç denemedim ama tüm hayatım boyunca bununla uğraştım. Geçeceğini kabul etmek hissi ortadan kaldırmaz.
"Bu kaşıntı beni bitirecek, sanki içten içe kemiriyor. Sinirlerimi bozuyor, delirtiyor."
"Sanki kaşıntı her şeyin üstüne çıkmış gibi hissediyorum, sinirlerimi bozuyor, delirmek üzereyim."
"Bu kaşıntıyla baş edemiyorum, sinirlerim bozuldu. Sanki her şey üstüme geliyor, kendimi kaybetmek üzereyim."
"Kaşıntının dayanılmaz bir ağırlığı var, sinirlerim bozuldu. Her şey çok zor, kendimi bir çıkmazın içinde buldum."
"Bu kaşıntı beni tüketti, sinirlerim bozuldu. Sanki her şey bir anda üstüme çöktü, hayattan bezdim."
oluyor ama ne yazık ki bunu daha kolay hale getirmiyor
"Bu gelişme hoş, fakat işleri kolaylaştırmıyor."
"Olumlu bir adım gibi görünse de, maalesef sorunları çözmüyor."
"Durum böyle, ancak bu sorunu çözmek için yeterli değil."
"İlerleme var gibi gözükse de, işleri daha basit hale getirmediğini söylemeliyim."
"İşler yolunda gidiyor, ancak henüz bir çözüm bulunmuş değil."
Bedenimize dayanmak zorunda kalıyoruz ve ondan sonra duygular ortaya çıkıyor.
Bedenimizin bize sağladığı temel ihtiyaçları karşılamak zorundayız ve sonra duygularımız ortaya çıkıyor.
"Fiziksel ihtiyaçlarımızdan kurtulduğumuzda, duygusal dünyamızın kapıları açılıyor."
"Bedenimizi dinleyerek ve onun ihtiyaçlarını karşılayarak, duygularımızın da daha net bir şekilde ortaya çıktığını fark ediyoruz."
"Bedenimizin sağladığı temel fonksiyonlara odaklandığımızda, duygularımızın daha net bir şekilde ifade edildiğini görüyoruz."
"Bedenimiz, duygularımızın ortaya çıkması için temel bir zemin sunuyor."
"Fiziksel duygular ve zihinsel/duygusal algılar/duygular kolayca karşılaştırılamaz... Paranoya, ret, öfke, PMDD durumundan ne etkilenebilirse etkilensin ama bu duyguyu ortadan kaldırmaz ve bu duygular güçlü olabilir."
"Fiziksel acı ile duygusal acı aynı değildir, ikisi de farklı şekillerde deneyimlenir."
Duygusal rahatsızlığın fiziksel belirtilerle nasıl bağlantılı olduğunu anlamak önemlidir.
"Parano ya da öfke, altında yatan bir koşuldan kaynaklanabilir, ancak bu hisleri yok etmez."
"Duyguların yoğunluğu fiziksel acıyı aşabilir, bu da işleri zorlaştırabilir."
"Fiziksel hastalıklar genellikle duygusal durumumuzu etkiler, ancak bu duyguları tam olarak tanımlamaz."
İşe yarayacak ve boktan iş arkadaşları ve müşterilerle uğraşacak. Çalışmalı ya da aç ve evsiz olacaksınız. Aileniz ve sevdiklerinizle etkileşime giriyor. Herkesi dışlamak sağlıklı değildir ve başkalarının sadece sizin için yumurta kabukları üzerinde yürümesini beklemek uygun değildir. Markete giderek aşırı uyarılıyor ve TP'den yiyip kaçamazsınız bir seçenek değil.
"Bu dünyada hayatta kalmak için, insanlar arasında yaşamalı ve işbirliği yapmalısınız. Yalnız bir kurt olmamak, zorlu zamanlarda hayatta kalmak için önemlidir."
Başkalarının her zaman sizi rahat ettirmelerini beklemek mümkün değil. Herkes kendi hayatıyla meşgul. Sizi rahatsız eden şeylerle başa çıkmanın yollarını bulmanız gerekiyor.
"Herkesin sadece kendi ihtiyaçlarına odaklanmaması gerektiğini anlamak önemlidir. Başkalarının da duyguları ve ihtiyaçları olduğunu unutmamalıyız. Herkesin kendi yumurta kabukları üzerinde yürümesine izin vermek, sağlıklı bir ilişki kurmanın yolu değildir."
"Yalnız kalmak ve herkesten uzaklaşmak cazip gelebilir, ancak gerçek şu ki, sosyalleşmek insan doğasına aykırıdır. Toplumsal yaratıklarız ve birbirimize ihtiyaç duyarız."
"Zorlu zamanlarda, insanların desteğine ihtiyacınız olabilir. Kendinize bakmak ve başkalarıyla sağlıklı ilişkiler kurmak önemlidir."
Alexithymia'ya sahip olma ihtimaliniz daha yüksektir. Bu da eylemlerinizi/düşüncelerinizi değiştirmenin interoceptive stres duygunuzu nasıl değiştiremeyeceğini anlamanın neden zor olduğunu açıklayabilir. Kendi stres tepkinizi birçok insan kadar hissedemezsiniz.
"Alexithymia nedeniyle, duygusal tepkilerinizi anlamakta zorluk çekiyorsunuz ve bu da stresle başa çıkmayı zorlaştırıyor."
"Stresin vücudunuzda nasıl hissettirdiğini tam olarak anlayamamanız, Alexithymia nedeniyle olabilir."
"Alexithymia, kendi duygusal durumunuzu ve stres tepkilerinizi anlamanızı zorlaştırabilir."
"Bu durum, stresin vücudunuzu nasıl etkilediğini fark etmenizi zorlaştırarak, Alexithymia'nın bir sonucu olabilir."
"Kendi duygu ve düşüncelerinizi anlamanın zorluğu, Alexithymia'nın bir göstergesi olabilir."
"Duygularımı tanıyabiliyorum, evet, ama bu onları uzaklaştırmıyor. Basitçe söylemek gerekirse, kimyasallar gelmeyi bırakana kadar duyguları dışarı sürmek zorundasınız. Hiçbir şey için kızgın olduğumu bilsem bile, kızmamak hala çok zor. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir neden olmayacak ve his ortadan kalkmayacak. Depresyonla aynı. Normal / mutlu kimyasallar ne yaparsanız yapın gelmez. Hiçbir şey test edilmez ama dayanıklılığınız test edilmez."
"Duygularımı kontrol edemiyorum, istediğim kadar kontrol etmek istesem de."
"Mutluluk hissi gelmiyor, her şeyi denediğim halde."
"Hissetmek istemediğim şeyler hissediyorum, bunların nedeni olmasa bile."
Beynimin bir noktada devreye gireceğini ve her şeyin yoluna gireceğini umuyorum.
"Kendimi kontrol etmem gereken bir haldeyim, ama bu kolay değil."
"Bir şey beni tetikleyene kadar sürekli olarak doğru hissetmediğim / kenarda hissetmediğim bu duyguların tümünde sıkışıp kaldım. Bunun en kötü yanı, beni neyin tetikleyeceğini, ne kadar süreceğini ve ne kadar şiddetli olacağını bilmiyorum. Örneğin rasyonel beynim dökülen süt için ağlamamayı bilir. PMDD beynim, gerçekten çok değerli yiyecekleri bile hak etmediğimi düşünmeye başlayacak."
"Tetikleyicilerle mücadele etmek gerçekten zor, çünkü kontrol edemediğim duygusal dalgalanmalar yaşıyorum."
"Bir şey beni tetiklediğinde, mantıklı düşünmek benim için çok zorlaşıyor ve bu da çok frustre edici."
"Duygusal durumumun aniden değişmesiyle mücadele ediyorum, bu da beni çok kırılgan hissettiriyor."
PMDD'nin hayatımı nasıl etkilediğini açıklamak gerçekten zor. Bazen kendimi kaybolmuş ve kontrolsüz hissediyorum.
Duygusal dalgalanmalarımın beni ne kadar etkilediğini anlamakta zorlanıyorum. Hayatın küçük şeyleri bile beni gerçekten sinirlendirebiliyor.
"Belirtilere ya da korkuya hiç yardımcı olmuyor. Her ay gelmesine rağmen ""geçici"" ama gelecek ay tekrar yaşamak zorunda kalacağım aynı üzüntüyü hala hissediyorum. En kötüsü sırasında, sadece ""sevgili Tanrım lütfen bunun bitmesine izin ver""..."
"Her ay aynı acı tekrar ediyor,  geçici olsa bile hiçbir şey yardımcı olmuyor."
Sanki bir döngüde sıkışıp kaldım. Korku ve belirtiler her ay beni buluyor.
"Belirtiler ve korkular gitmiyor, 'geçici' de olsa her ay aynı acıya katlanmak zorunda kalıyorum."
"Bu geçici olsa bile, her ay bu korkuyu ve üzüntüyü yaşamak beni yıpratıyor."
"Hiçbir şey yardımcı olmuyor. Aynı korkular ve belirtiler her ay geri dönüyor, sadece 'lütfen bunun bitmesine izin ver' diye yalvarabiliyorum."
"Ayrılma, beyin sisli hissetme ve gerçekten kenarda hissetme eğilimindeyim... endişeli hissediyorum ve bu beni tam bir panik atak geçirmeme yol açtı... Beyin sisli hissetmek ve ayrışmak ve bunun olduğunu bilmek ama hiçbir şey yapamamak beni tuzağa düşürüyor."
"Ayrışma hissetmek, her şeyi bulanık görme, tamamen dışlanmış gibi hissetmek... endişelenmek ve bunu tam bir panik atağa dönüştürmek çok korkutucu."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi sürekli olarak beyin sisli hissediyorum, gerçeği algılamakta zorlanıyorum, sanki hayatın kenarında duruyorum... kaygı beni tamamen ele geçiriyor ve panik atak geçirmemi sağlıyor."
"Ayrışma, beyin sisli hissetme, kenarda olma hissi... endişelerim beni tamamen tüketiyor ve panik atak geçirmeme neden oluyor."
"Bu hisler, beyin sisli hissetmek, kendini ayrı hissetmek, hayatın kenarında olmak...endişelerim beni boğuyor ve kontrolü kaybetmeme yol açıyor."
"Ayrışma, beyin sisli hissetmek ve gerçeklikten kopmuş gibi hissetmek... endişelerim beni tamamen tüketiyor ve beni panik atağa sürüklüyor."
"Lymbic sistemi ateşlendiğinde (duygulardan sorumlu sistem), frontal lob (bilişten sorumlu vb.) kapanır ve çevrimdışı hale gelir ve bu duygular tekrar aşağı gelene kadar ""oh yah, pmdd'sini biliyorum, muhtemelen aşırı tepki gösterdim"" diye hatırlayamazsınız... o zaman bazen onları anlayabilen insanlar var, ancak şu anda sadece kendi duygularınızı yönetmek için değil, aynı zamanda kendi duygularınızı yönetmek için de onlara acı veriyor."
"Lymbic sistemi devreye girdiğinde, mantıksal düşünme yeteneğimizi kaybetmemiz gibi, duygularımızın bizi ele geçirdiği anlarda çevremizdekilere hakaretamiz davranabiliyoruz."
"Duygularımız kontrolü ele geçirdiğinde, frontal lobumuz pasif hale geliyor ve mantıklı düşünmekten uzaklaşıyoruz, bu da bize aşırı tepkiler vermemize neden oluyor."
"Duygusal patlamalar yaşarken, kontrolü ele geçiren duygularımız, mantıklı düşünmemizi engelleyerek, kontrolsüz ve belki de kırıcı davranışlara yol açıyor."
"Bu duygusal dalgalanmalarda, frontal lobumuz devre dışı kalıyor ve yalnızca duygularımız belirleyici oluyor, bu da etrafımızdakileri anlayışsız ve kırgın hissettirebiliyor."
"Duygusal yoğunluğun bizi ele geçirdiği anlarda, düşünme yeteneğimiz körelerek, sözlerimizi ve eylemlerimizi kontrol edebilme kapasitemizi yitiriyoruz."
"Gerçekten evliliğimde delicesine mutsuz olduğuma ve boşanmak istediğime, çocuklarımın bensiz daha iyi olacağına ve kesinlikle hiç kimsem olmadığına inanıyorum. Bunların hormonal tepkiler olduğunu biliyorum, aynı zamanda çok güçlü olduklarını da hissediyorum, onlara bazı gerçekler olmalı."
"Evliliğimden çok mutsuz olduğumu, boşanmak istediğimi ve çocuklarımın benimle daha iyi olacağını düşünüyorum. Belki de bu hisler geçici ama şu an çok güçlüler."
"Bu hormonların beni kontrol ettiğini düşünüyorum, her şeyi abartıyorum. Ama bir yandan, boşanmak istediğim ve çocuklarımın daha iyi olacağı doğru."
"Gerçekten boşanmak istiyorum, ama aynı zamanda bunun yanlış olduğuna dair bir his var. Bu duygulara güvenip güvenemeyeceğimi bilmiyorum."
"Bütün bunlar hormonlar yüzünden, bunu biliyorum. Ama bu hislerin gerçekte bir şeylere işaret ettiği de mümkün."
"Bu hisler kaybolursa bile, şu an çok gerçekler. Çocuklarımın bensiz daha mutlu olacağı gerçeği beni korkutuyor."
Umutsuzluk duygularından kurtulmak gerçekten zordur... Kontrolsüzdür. Yorucudur. Bilginin bir tedaviye eşit olmadığı nedeni bilmene rağmen.
"Umutsuzluk, insanın içindeki en karanlık köşelerden biridir, oradan sıyrılmak neredeyse imkansız gibi gelir."
"Umutsuzluk gibi bir duygu, insanı kontrolü elinden alır, sürekli bir yorgunluk ve çaresizlik hissi yaratır."
"Bilsem bile, umutsuzluğa karşı bir çözümün olmadığını, bu duygunun içindeki yıkıcı gücü engelleyemediğimi hissediyorum."
"Umutsuzluk, kendine hakim olmak istediğin ama kontrol edemediğin bir fırtına gibidir, seni tüketen bir boşluk yaratır."
"Umutsuzluk, bir karanlık bulut gibi üzerime çöker, her şeyin boş ve anlamsız olduğunu düşünmeme neden olur."
"İyi haftalar boyunca, netlik ve iyimserlik hissediyorum... Kötü haftalar boyunca, negatif netlik hissediyorum ve pozitif netlik kadar gerçek hissettiriyor."
"İyi günlerde, enerjik ve mutlu hissediyorum. Kötü günlerde ise, mutsuzluk yoğun bir şekilde hissediliyor ve gerçekliğin bir parçası gibi görünüyor."
"Zihnim açık ve umutluyken, enerjik ve motive hissediyorum. Karamsar hissettiğim zamanlarda ise, bu olumsuzluk gerçek ve kaçınılmaz hissettiriyor."
"Olumlu düşüncelerle dolu olduğum zamanlarda, hayat parlak ve kolay görünüyor. Ama kötü günlerde, karanlık ve umutsuz hissediyorum."
"Mutlu olduğumda, geleceğe dair umutlarım net ve güçlü. Ancak kötü hissettiğimde, umutsuzluk gerçek ve ezici geliyor."
"İyi günlerde, hayatın anlamını daha net görüyorum. Kötü günlerde ise, anlamını kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Benim için, genellikle ne zaman mantıksız olduğumu biliyorum, ancak bu daha az acıtmıyor... PMDD'm oldukça kendine odaklanmış, ancak başkalarıyla etkileşimler tatsızsa daha da kötüleştirebilir."
"PMDD nedeniyle, mantıksız hareket ettiğimin farkında olsam da, hissettiğim rahatsızlık azalmıyor."
Kendimi çok duygusal hissettiğimde mantıklı düşünmem zorlaşıyor ve bu da başkalarıyla olan etkileşimlerimi olumsuz etkiliyor.
"PMDD'm, sadece kendimi kötü hissetmeme değil, aynı zamanda sosyal etkileşimlerimi de zorlaştırıyor."
"Sanki bir duman bulutunun içindeymişim gibi hissediyorum, çevremdeki her şey bulanıklaşıyor ve tepkilerim tahmin edilemez hale geliyor."
"Benim için, PMDD'nin en zorlayıcı yönlerinden biri, kontrolden çıktığım hissi ve bunun başkalarıyla ilişkilerime yansıması."
"Cehennem haftası boyunca neden hissettiğimi anlayabiliyorum, ancak bu gerçekleşme duyguların gitmesini sağlamaz. Hormonlar beynimin işleyişini değiştiriyor."
"Bu haftanın ruh halimde ne kadar büyük bir etkisi olduğunu hissediyorum, ama bu gerçekleşme duyguları yatıştırmak için yeterli değil."
"Hormonal değişimler beni kontrolsüz bir duygusal iniş çıkışa sürüklüyor, bunu hissedebiliyorum."
"Biliyorum ki bu sadece bir haftalık bir süreç, ama bu süreçte hissettiğim duygular gerçekten yorucu."
"Tüm bu duygusal fırtınada kaybolmak çok kolay, ama kendimi kontrol altına almam gerek."
"Gerçekleşme duyguları beni sakinleştiremiyor, hala bu hormonal dalgalanmaların etkisi altındayım."
"Ağlamak, fiziksel olarak kontrol edemediğimiz bir eylemdir, tıpkı bir başkasının onu karşılaştırdığı gibi sıcak bir flaş gibi."
Ağlamanın duygusal bir patlama gibi kontrol edilemeyen bir tepki olduğu gerçeğini ifade etmek için sıcak bir flaş örneğini kullanıyor.
"Bu benzetme, ağlamanın ani ve yoğun bir şekilde ortaya çıktığını ve kişinin kontrolü dışında olduğunu vurguluyor."
"Ağlamak, tıpkı bir sıcak flaş gibi vücudu ele geçiren ve kontrolü kaybetmemize neden olan bir eylemdir."
"Tıpkı sıcak bir flaş gibi, ağlamak da ani bir şekilde gelir ve yoğun bir şekilde hissedilir, kontrolümüz dışında gerçekleşir."
"Ağlamak, sıcak bir flaş gibi, bedenimizi ele geçiren ve duygusal olarak bizi tamamen etkisi altına alan bir eylemdir."
Hormonlar olduğunu biliyorum (diğer faktörlerle birlikte) ama bu duyguları *poof* ortadan kaldırmaz.
"Hormonlar, duygu durumumuzda etkili olsalar da, tek başlarına her şeyi çözümlemez."
"Bu duyguların sadece hormonlarla alakalı olduğunu düşünmek çok basitçe, gerçekçi değil."
"Bildiğiniz gibi, biyolojik faktörler de rol oynuyor, ancak bunlar tek başına duygularımızı kontrol etmiyor."
"Bu duyguların nedeninin tamamen hormonal olduğunu düşünmek, durumu çok basite indirgemek olur."
Hormonlar elbette önemli ama duygularımı bu kadar kolay ortadan kaldıracak bir sihirli değnek değil.
Sebepsiz yere ağlıyorum ya da son derece küçük bir şey için bir uyum sağlıyorum... Çok karışık duygularım var... O anda hissediyorum... Vücudumun bana bunu yaptığı ve her ay olduğu bazı öfke / kırgınlıklar da var.
"Sanki bir şey beni çok rahatsız ediyor ama ne olduğunu tam olarak bilemiyorum, kendimi kötü hissediyorum ve nedenini anlayamıyorum."
"Küçük bir şey bile beni çok üzüyor, sanki dünyanın sonu gelmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Aynı duyguları her ay yaşıyorum, çok zor bir dönemden geçiyorum."
"Kontrol edemediğim duygulara kapılıyorum, bu beni çok yoruyor."
"Sanki vücudum beni bir cezalandırıyor, ne olduğunu anlayamıyorum ama çok üzgünüm."
"Harika bir hafta geçirirdim, hayatım iyi, işimi seviyorum ve şefkatli bir kocam ve harika arkadaşlarımla güzel bir evim var. Peki neden Kermit intiharına hazırım? Bugün üzgün hissediyorum ve ölmek istiyorum."
"Her şeyim mükemmel gibi görünüyor; harika bir ailem, iyi bir işim ve hayatımın tadını çıkarıyorum. Peki neden bu kadar mutsuz hissediyorum?"
"Her şey yolunda gibi gözüküyor, ama bugün hiç iyi hissetmiyorum ve gerçekten kendimi kötü hissediyorum."
"Hayatım harika, her şey mükemmel, ama bugün gerçekten kötü hissediyorum ve ölmek istiyorum."
"Mutlu olmam için her şeyim var, ama bugün neden bu kadar üzgünüm?"
"Sevgili eşim, muhteşem arkadaşlarım ve mükemmel bir evim var. Peki neden bu kadar boş hissediyorum? Bugün çok mutsuzum."
Bu durum düzenli olarak kendimi öldürmek istememe neden oluyor.
Bu yaşadığım durumun beni sürekli olarak intihar düşüncelerine sürüklediğini hissediyorum.
"Bu sürekli devam eden sıkıntı, ölümle yüzleşme isteğimi tetikliyor."
Her geçen gün aynı sorunlar yüzünden kendimi yok etmek istediğimi düşünüyorum.
"Bu düzenli olarak tekrarlanan zorluklar, hayattan kopmak isteğimi artırıyor."
Durumun sürekli olarak aynı olması beni kendimi ortadan kaldırma düşüncesine götürüyor.
"Hormonlarım kaymaya başladığında, genel bir huzursuzluk hissi devralmaya başlar. Beynim bu duygularla, ateşi besleyecek her şeyle uyuşacak düşünceler aramaya başlar... Beynim bir şeyleri çarpıtır ve kandırır, çünkü o kimyasal kaos hissine uyması gerekir."
"Hormonlarımı kontrol edemediğim zamanlarda, sanki her şeyin yanlış gittiği hissine kapılıyorum."
"Adet dönemi yakınlaştığında, sinirlerim bozulmaya başlıyor ve düşüncelerim kontrolden çıkıyor."
"Hormonal dalgalanmalar yaşarken, düşüncelerim olumsuz bir yöne doğru kayıyor ve her şey beni üzüyor."
"Vücudumdaki kimyasallar değiştiğinde, sanki her şeyin anlamını kaybettiği hissine kapılıyorum."
"Hormonlarım beni kontrol etmeye başladığında, mantıklı düşünmek benim için çok zorlaşıyor."
"Kendimi *bok* gibi hissediyorum ve huysuz ve asabiyim... Sadece bu durumun adaletsizliğinden dolayı acı ve hayal kırıklığına uğradım, hayatımda olup biten her şeyle birleştim."
"Çok kötü hissediyorum, öfkeli ve sinirliyim... Bu durumun haksızlığı beni çok üzüyor ve hayal kırıklığına uğrattı, sanki hayatımın her köşesinde beni rahatsız ediyor."
"İçimde bir boşluk var, huysuz ve sinirliyim... Hayatın bana attığı bu haksızlıktan dolayı büyük bir acı ve hayal kırıklığı yaşıyorum, her şey birleşmiş gibi."
"Kendimi tamamen çökük hissediyorum, sinirli ve öfkeliyim... Bu durumun bana yaşattığı haksızlığa öfkeleniyorum, hayatımın hiçbir yerinde huzur bulamıyorum."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sinirli ve huysuzum... Bu durumun adaletsizliği beni yiyip bitiriyor, hayatımın her alanına etki ediyor."
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor, sinirli ve öfkeliyim... Bu durumun haksızlığı beni derin bir hayal kırıklığına uğrattı, sanki hayatın her yerinde beni takip ediyor."
Bu vücudumda gerçekten var olduğum için kendimi bok gibi hissediyorum. Bunda yanlış olan tüm o boktan şeyler var.
Kendimi bu bedende bu kadar yanlış hissetmek inanılmaz derecede rahatsız edici.
"Bu bedene hapsolmuş gibi hissediyorum, sanki kendimle uyumsuz bir şekilde yaşıyorum."
"Kendimle ve vücudumla ilgili her şey bana yanlış geliyor, sanki bir hata gibiyim."
"Bu bedenin içinde olmayı reddediyorum,  beni hapsettiği hissine kapılıyorum."
Vücudumda bu kadar yanlış hissetmek beni çaresiz ve umutsuz hissettiriyor.
Bir bütün olarak pmdd deneyimi tarif edilmesi en zor şeyler üzerinde olmuştu.
PMDD'nin genel etkilerini anlatmak gerçekten zor.
PMDD'nin tüm yönlerini tanımlamak inanılmaz derecede zorlayıcı.
"PMDD deneyimini tam olarak ifade etmek, benim için en zorlu görevlerden biri."
PMDD'nin nasıl hissettirdiğini kelimelerle anlatmak imkansız gibi.
"PMDD'yi tüm yönleriyle açıklamak zor, bu nedenle insanların anlaması çok zor."
"Sana yakın biri gibi boğucu göğüslü duygu yeni öldü. Benim için öfke (ve ara sıra ekolalia) özellikle tuhaf, sanki bir başkası vücudumun kontrolüne sahip. Gerçekten şeytani sahip olma kavramıyla ilgiliyim."
"Birinin içine sıkışmış hissetmekle, bir şeylerin benim kontrolümde olmadığı hissi arasındaki uyumsuzluk, benim için son derece rahatsız edici."
"Sanki bir başka varlık benim vücudumda yaşıyor ve duygularımın kontrolünü ele geçirmiş gibi, öfkenin ve tekrarlayan konuşmaların içimden nasıl çıktığını anlamıyorum."
"Bu yoğun ve istem dışı duygu, sanki kendi vücudumun dışında, başka bir varlık tarafından kontrol ediliyor."
"Benim için öfke, sanki bir başkası duygularımı yönetiyor gibi, bir çeşit ruhsal sahiplik gibi hissettiriyor."
"Fiziksel olarak var olmayan bir varlığın benimle birlikte olması fikri korkunç bir gerçeklikle dolu, sanki vücudumda bir şeylerin ters gittiği gibi."
Tüm vücudum buna yürekten inanıyor... Zihni yeniden yönlendirmektense vücudu dinlendirmek çok daha zor. Ayrıca trende hüküm sürmek için aralıklı olarak hayattan çıkmam gerekiyor.
"Bedenimi dinlemek zihnimi kontrol etmekten çok daha kolay, sanki bedenim kendi bildiğini okuyor. Bu yüzden hayatın beni ne kadar zorlasa da bir süreliğine kendimi ona bırakıp yeniden şarj olmalıyım."
"Fiziksel olarak yorulmak, zihinsel yorgunluğu yenmekten çok daha basit geliyor. Bu nedenle kendime zaman zaman bir mola vermem ve her şeyden uzaklaşmam gerekiyor ki hayata daha güçlü geri dönebileyim."
Sanki bedenim kendi kararlarını alıyor ve zihnimi dinlemiyor. Bu yüzden zihnimi kontrol etmektense vücudumu dinlendirmeye odaklanıyorum ve bu da beni hayattan kısa süreli aralıklarla koparmayı gerektiriyor.
"Zihnim ne kadar zorlarsa zorlasın, bedenim çok daha kolay bir şekilde dinlenip yenileniyor. Hayattan uzaklaşma ihtiyacı, bu bedensel dinlenme ihtiyacından kaynaklanıyor."
"Vücudumun verdiği sinyalleri dinlemem gerekiyor çünkü zihnimin beni zorladığı yerlerde, bedenim daha gerçekçi bir bakış açısı sağlıyor. Bu yüzden aralıklı olarak kendimi hayattan soyutlamam gerekiyor."
Bazen BF'min PMDD'm kötüleştiğinde ilaçlarımı kurcaladığını düşünüyorum.
BF'm PMDD'si kötüleştiğinde ilaçlarımı değiştirip değiştirmemem gerektiğini düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum.
PMDD'm şiddetlendiğinde ilaçlarımdan daha fazlasına ihtiyacım olup olmadığını merak ediyorum.
BF'm PMDD'm kötüleştiğinde kendimi çok kırılgan hissediyorum.
PMDD'm kötüleştiğinde kendimi kötü hissetmemek için ilaçlarımı doğru dozda alıp almadığımı sorgulamadan edemiyorum.
BF'm PMDD'si kötüleştiğinde ilaçlarımı almaktan başka yapabileceğim bir şey olup olmadığını merak ediyorum.
"Sık sık PMDD ile geçirdiğim en kötü anların *ben* gibi hissetmediğini anlatırım. Normal bir günde asla sahip olamayacağım güvensizlikler ve düşüncelere kapılıyorum. Genellikle vücudumun oldukça iyi göründüğünü düşünüyorum, asla olumsuz bir öz konuşmayla meşgul olmuyorum... ama bir aynanın önünden yürüdüğümü ve bir bölüm boyunca kontrol edilemez göründüğümü ve değersiz olduğumu kendime düşündüğümü canlı bir şekilde hatırlıyorum. Bu bana çok benziyordu, neredeyse normal benim düşünceme daha da çabuk dönüştü."
"PMDD'nin beni kendimi yabancı hissettirdiği zamanlarda, olağanüstü derecede güvensiz ve düşünceli hissettiğimi düşünüyorum, ki bu normalde asla böyle olmaz."
"Bu durum yüzünden, kendimi değersiz ve yetersiz hissettiğim o anlar, bana çok gerçekçi geliyor ve bu hisler normale dönmek için çok çabuk geçiyor."
Vücudumun genellikle iyi göründüğünü düşünürüm ve olumsuz düşüncelerim olmaz ama bazen aynaya baktığımda kontrolsüz ve değersiz olduğumu düşünürüm.
"Kendimi çok çabuk değersiz ve çirkin hissettiğim zamanlar, sanki bana ait olmayan bir düşünce gibi geliyor."
"Normalde kendime olan güvenim çok yüksektir, ancak PMDD'nin beni ele geçirdiği zamanlarda, kendimi çirkin ve değersiz hissederim."
Aileme açıklamaya çalıştım ve bunu uydurduğumu düşündüler. Sağlıklı bir insan için sağduyunun ne zaman bu kadar açık olduğunu açıklamak gerçekten zor.
"Aileme durumu anlattığımda, olayları uydurduğumu düşündüler."
"Sağduyu, normal bir insan için bu kadar belirgin olunca, onlara nedenini anlatmak gerçekten zor."
"Açıklamaya çalıştım ama anlamakta zorlandılar, sanki gerçekliğe inanmayı reddediyorlardı."
"Sağlıklı bir akıl için aşikar olanı, onlara anlatmak imkansızdı."
"Ailemin, aklını kaybettiğimi düşünmesi beni gerçekten üzdü, çünkü sadece gerçekleri anlatmaya çalışıyordum."
"Artık yüksekler ve alçaklar yok, sadece çok sıkıldım. Eskiden sevdiğim hiçbir şey artık bu kadar ilginç gelmiyor. Tek hissettiğim şey uzanmak."
"Her şey bana anlamsız geliyor, neşe de, üzüntü de, sadece bitkinlik."
"İlgi çekici bulduğum hiçbir şey kalmadı, hiçbir şey için heyecanlanmıyorum."
"Eskiden sevdiğim şeylerden zevk alamıyorum, hayatımda bir boşluk var."
"Hayatın iniş çıkışları artık beni etkilemiyor, hiçbir şey hissetmiyorum."
"Hayatımda bir isteksizlik, bir boşluk hissediyorum, eskiden sevdiğim her şeyden soğudum."
"Herkesten ve her şeyden çekildim. Sadece çalışıyormuş gibi davrandım ve sadece bütün gün uyudum.... Kötüleşiyorum, gerçekten kötü,... Hayatım ve zihinsel sağlığım birkaç haftada bir dağılıyor ve sonra kayboluyor ve iyiyim."
"Her şeyi bıraktım, sadece uyuyup yorgunluğumu bastırmaya çalışıyorum. "
"İnsanlar ve hayatın yükü beni yoruyor, sadece içime kapanıp dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Kendimi dünyadan soyutladım, hiç kimseyle iletişim kurmuyorum, sadece uyuyorum."
"İçinde bulunduğum durumdan ve çevremden uzaklaşmak istiyorum, sadece uyuyarak her şeyden kaçabiliyorum."
"Her şeyden bıktım, hayattan ve kendimden, sadece uyuya uyuya günlerimi geçirmek istiyorum."
"Yaklaşık 10 yıl önce PTSD/anksiyete/depresyon için Prozac reçete edildim. Depresyonum daha da kötüleştiği için almayı bıraktım ve hafızam belirgin bir şekilde daha da kötüleşiyordu. Prozac'tan çıkmak yardımcı oldu. PMDD'm her döngüyle ortaya çıkmaz, ancak çıktığında korkunçtur. Ayrılıklardan, işte mücadele etmekten ve depresyonumla ilgili olmaktan sorumluydu."
"Prozac, ruh halimi dengelemek yerine daha kötü bir hale getirdi."
"İlaçlar, bazen istenmeyen yan etkilerle birlikte gelir ve bu durum, benim için, Prozac ile yaşandı."
"İlaç, özellikle PMDD semptomları açısından, beni daha kötü hissettirdi."
"Prozac, diğer ilaçların daha etkili olmasını engellemiş olabilir."
"Bu ilaç, benim için, faydadan çok zarar sağladı."
"Oldukça şiddetli PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB var. SI, müdahaleci düşüncelerim ve majör depresyonum var."
"Çok ağır PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB var. SI, zorlayıcı düşünceler ve majör depresyonum var."
"Ciddi PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB hastasıyım. SI, işgalci düşünceler ve majör depresyon da yaşıyorum."
"PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB ile mücadele ediyorum. Ayrıca SI, zorlayıcı düşünceler ve majör depresyonum var."
"PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB'nin yanı sıra SI, müdahaleci düşünceler ve majör depresyon da yaşıyorum."
"Çok şiddetli PMDD, OKB, bipolar bozukluk ve DEHB var. SI, zorlayıcı düşünceler ve majör depresyonum da var."
Kaybeden kontrolleri gibi hissetmek... 'Ya gerçekten burada değilsem?' gibi garip düşünceler düşünmek... Sonra ağlamak için aşırı bir hırıltı ihtiyacı hissettim.
"Bir boşlukta asılı kalmış gibi hissettim,  çevremden kopmuş gibi..."
"Sanki kendi bedenimin içinde kaybolmuşum gibi hissettim,  her şey çok uzak gibiydi..."
"Hiçbir şeyin anlam ifade etmediği bir duygu vardı,  sanki gerçeklikten kopmuştum..."
"Bir kara deliğe çekiliyormuş gibi hissettim,  etrafımda dönen boşlukta kaybolmuş gibi..."
"Kendimden uzaklaştım,  sanki bir film izliyormuşum gibi kendimi izliyordum..."
"Duygularımdan ve düşüncelerimden şüphe etmek yerine durumu kabul etmeme yardımcı olacağını hissediyorum, o kadar ciddi olmadığını ve sadece aşırı tepki verdiğimi düşünüyorum."
"Duygularımı ve düşüncelerimi sorguluyorum, belki de durum o kadar kötü değil ve sadece abartıyorum."
"Hissettiğim kadar kötü olmadığını, sadece fazla tepki verdiğimi düşünmek rahatlatıcı olur."
Her şeyi abarttığımı ve aslında kötü bir şey olmadığını düşünerek sakinleşmeyi umuyorum.
"Belki de abartıyorum, duruma duygusal olarak bakmaktan ziyade mantıklı bir şekilde yaklaşmak gerekiyor."
Duygularımın beni yanıltıyor olabileceğini ve durumun aslında o kadar da vahim olmadığını düşünüyorum.
Şu anda kendimden nefret ediyorum. PMDD evresinde şiddetli beyin sisi ve migren geçiriyorum. Onu her zaman bir gömlek ve külotla aldım. Bunu artık gerçekten yapamam. Tüm en kötü hatalarım PMDD'nin sancıları içindeyken olur.
"Bu ayın zamanı geldiğinde her şey çok zorlaşıyor, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
PMDD'nin benim için ne kadar zor olduğunu kimse anlamıyor.
Kendim olduğum zaman çok iyiyim ama bu dönemde gerçekten berbatım.
Bu dönemde beni affetmeni istiyorum çünkü kendimi kontrol edemiyorum.
Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşamak zorunda olmak çok yorucu.
"Düşüncesizce düşüncelere daldım ve entrikacı düşüncelere girmeme konusunda gittikçe daha da kötüleşiyorum, bunun üzerine kendimi tekrarlıyorum, neredeyse bir şişe vitamine sahip oluyordum, her zaman beni öldürmemesi gerekirdi, ama son zamanlarda pmd öfkem olduğunda ve kedilerim bana yaklaştığında, onları kilitlemem ya da onlardan uzak durmam gerektiği gibi bir şey yapacaktım."
"Kendimi anlamsız düşüncelere kaptırdığım için endişeleniyorum, bu da beni daha da sinirlendiriyor, bu yüzden kendimi tekrarlıyorum ve tekrarlıyorum."
"Duygusal tepkilerim üzerindeki kontrolümü kaybettiğimde, evcil hayvanlarım etraftayken onları bile incitebileceğimi düşünüyorum."
"Düşüncelerim kontrolden çıkıyor ve bu da beni agresif hale getiriyor, bu gerçekten korkutucu."
"Bu düşünce döngüsünden kurtulamıyorum, öfkem beni yutuyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Duygusal dengesizliğim giderek kötüleşiyor, bu beni korkutuyor çünkü çevremdekileri incitebileceğimi düşünüyorum."
"Bir hafta önce RAVENously yiyin, ancak döngünüz başlamadan iki gün önce iştahınız olmasın. Ve döneminiz boyunca yemekten daha"
"Dönemim öncesinde mümkün olduğunca çok yiyorum, ancak başlamadan önce çok fazla yiyecek yemeyi kesmem gerekiyor."
Dönem başlamadan iki gün önce gerçekten yiyecek istemiyorum ama dönemimden bir hafta önce çok yemek yiyorum.
"Dönemimden bir hafta önce yediklerimi telafi etmek için, dönemimden iki gün önce yemek yemeyi kesmem gerekiyor."
"Dönemimden bir hafta önce bir sürü yemek yiyorum, ancak başlamadan iki gün önce yiyeceğe karşı ilgim yok."
"Dönemimden bir hafta önce çok yemek yiyorum, ancak başlamadan iki gün önce midem bulandırıyor."
"Ayrıca, partneri de dahil olmak üzere insanlardan çekilmekle ilgili geçmiş zorluklardan bahsetti... PMDD nedeniyle beni terk etmesi konusunda endişeli hissetmeye başladım (bu bazen kendimi sabote ediyor ve kendimi çekiyor)"
PMDD'nin benim için ne kadar zor olduğunu tam olarak anlayamadığını hissediyorum.
Bu durumun ilişkimi etkilemesinden ve partnerimi uzaklaştırmasından korkuyorum.
"İlişkimizdeki sorunlar yüzünden partnerimi kaybetmekten korkuyorum, kendimi geri çekiyorum ve ilişkimizi sabote ediyorum."
"Kendimi uzaklaştırıp partnerimi kaybetme korkusuyla yaşıyorum, bu da beni daha da endişeli yapıyor."
Geçmişte benzer durumlar yaşadım ve bu da beni partnerimden uzaklaştırma korkusuyla doluyor.
"Son derece sinirliyim, kesinlikle STARVING ve sadece genel olarak karamsarım... Gerçekten kötü PMDD'm var, bu yüzden adet döngülerim berbat... Herkese saldırmaktan yoruldum."
"Bugün çok yorgunum, kötü bir gün geçiriyorum ve kendimi kontrol etmekte zorlanıyorum."
"Gerginim, açım ve her şey beni üzüyor. Şu anda kendimi gerçekten iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Sinirlerim bozuldu, açım ve her şey umutsuz görünüyor. Kendimi sadece kötü hissediyorum."
Bugünlerde çok yorgun hissediyorum ve vücudum beni ele geçiriyor. Her şey çok zor.
"Sinirli, aç ve umutsuz hissediyorum. Bu zamanları atlatmak için mücadele ediyorum."
Çok yorgun ve üzgün hissediyorum. Gözyaşlarına boğuluyorum. Her an uyuyabiliyorum. İştahım yok.
"Çok yorgunum, sanki vücudum beni taşımak istemiyor."
"Üzüntüm o kadar yoğun ki, nefes almak bile zorlaşıyor."
"Her şey bana ağır geliyor, sanki bir yük altında eziliyormuş gibi."
"Bir an önce uyuyup her şeyi unutup, yeniden doğmak istiyorum."
"Hiçbir şey yemek istemiyorum, yemek bile enerjimi tüketiyor."
"İnsülin alırken baş dönmesi, baş ağrısı, anksiyete vb."
"İnsülin aldıktan sonra mide bulantısı, terleme, titreme gibi belirtiler de görülebilir."
"Bazı kişilerde insülin kullanımı sonrası yorgunluk, halsizlik, konsantrasyon bozukluğu yaşanabilir."
"İnsülinin yan etkileri arasında deri döküntüsü, kaşıntı, şişlik gibi reaksiyonlar da görülebilir."
İnsülin kullanırken meydana gelen bu belirtilerden herhangi birini yaşarsanız hemen doktorunuza başvurmanız önemlidir.
"İnsülin kullanımının uzun vadeli etkileri arasında göz problemleri, böbrek yetmezliği gibi sağlık sorunları da yer alabilir."
Im çok fazla iltihap ve toplam ve tamamen bitkinlik bu döngü dayanılmaz bir dereceye kadar
"Bu iltihap ve bitkinlikle baş edemiyorum, her şey çok yorucu."
"Sürekli iltihap ve yorgunluktan bezdim, bu döngü hiç bitmiyor."
"Bu iltihap ve bitkinlik beni tamamen tüketti, artık dayanacak gücüm kalmadı."
"Bu iltihaplar ve bitkinlik beni mahvediyor, artık bu döngüden kurtulmak istiyorum."
"Bu iltihap ve yorgunluk beni çok kötü etkiliyor, artık bu döngüden çıkamayacağımı düşünüyorum."
"Ruh hali sorunları, yumurtalık kistleri ve uterus fibroidleri yaşıyorum."
"Sağlık sorunlarımla uğraşıyorum, özellikle de ruh halim, yumurtalık kistleri ve uterus fibroidleri beni çok zorluyor."
"Ruhsal durumum, yumurtalık kistlerim ve uterus fibroidlerim nedeniyle zor bir dönemden geçiyorum."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi oldukça kötü hissediyorum, hem ruhsal anlamda hem de yumurtalık kistlerim ve uterus fibroidlerim nedeniyle."
"Ruh halim bozulmuş, ayrıca yumurtalık kistleri ve uterus fibroidleri sorunları yaşıyorum."
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal sağlık sorunları beni oldukça yıpratıyor, özellikle de yumurtalık kistleri ve uterus fibroidleri beni endişelendiriyor."
Bu hafta neden bu kadar depresyonda olduğumu anlamaya çalışıyordum.
Bu hafta neden bu kadar moralsiz olduğumu çözmeye çalışıyorum.
Son zamanlarda neden bu kadar mutsuz hissettiğimi anlamakta zorlanıyorum.
Bu hafta kendimi neden bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi anlayamıyorum.
Bu hafta neden bu kadar umutsuz hissettiğimi anlamakta zorlanıyorum.
Bu hafta neden bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi kavramaya çalışıyorum.
"Anksiyete, Endişeli bağlanma tarzı, Uykusuzluk, Düzenli eski depresyon, Kronik yorgunluk"
"Zihinsel sağlık sorunlarım, aşırı düşünme, kaygı ve sürekli bir tükenmişlik hissi ile karakterize ediliyor."
"Kendimi sürekli endişeli ve yorgun hissediyorum, uyku sorunlarım var ve sık sık depresyonun pençesinde yakalanıyorum."
"Yaşadığım anksiyete, ilişki sorunlarına ve uykuya dalmakta zorluk çekmeme yol açıyor, tüm bunlar beni kronik bir yorgunluğa sürüklüyor."
"Sürekli bir endişe halinde olmak, uyku düzenimi bozmak, beni depresyona sürüklemek ve sürekli bir yorgunluk hissiyle yaşamamı sağlamak, hayatımı zorlaştırıyor."
"Kaygı, sağlıksız bağlanma biçimleri, uykusuzluk ve düzenli depresyon benim için kronik yorgunluğa yol açıyor, bu durum hayatımı olumsuz etkiliyor."
Huzursuzluk duygularıma güvenemem. Duygularıma güvenemem. Rahatlığıma güvenemem. Sabrıma güvenemem. Kendime güvenemem. Beni tüketecek umutsuzluğa güvenemem.
"Kendimde ne bulduğumu bilmiyorum, bu yüzden kendime güvenemiyorum."
"İç sesimi dinleyemiyorum, çünkü bana asla doğru yolu göstermiyor."
"Bu boşlukta kendimi kaybediyorum, bu yüzden iç güdülerime güvenemeyeceğimi hissediyorum."
"Benim için doğru olanı seçebileceğime inanmıyorum, çünkü duygularım beni her zaman yanlış yönlendiriyor."
"Her zaman kayboluyorum, her zaman mücadele ediyorum, her zaman başarısız oluyorum, çünkü kendimi kandırıyorum."
Oldukça aşağı ve dışarı hissediyorum. Olası cerrahi / hrt tedavisi etrafındaki soruşturmalar ve tartışmalar için February'de geri sevk edildim. Bu daha sonra beni günlerce hastaneye ve yatağa bindiren gerçekten kötü bir bölüm nedeniyle hızlandırıldı.
Sağlık sorunları nedeniyle kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Cerrahi veya hormon replasman tedavisi hakkında daha fazla bilgi edinmek için Şubat ayında doktora görünmem gerekiyor.
Bu durumun nedeni son günlerde geçirdiğim kötü bir dönemdi ve bu da beni hastanede ve yatakta geçirmeme neden oldu.
Sağlık durumumun kötü olması beni çok endişelendiriyor.
Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak oldukça yorgun hissediyorum.
"Kendimi aşırı genişlettiğim için çok kötüyüm ve insanlara luteal sırasında veya liderlik ederken 'hayır, yapamam' demeye yardımcı oluyor."
"Kendimi çok fazla zorladığım için kendimi kötü hissediyorum, insanlara luteal fazlarında veya liderlik pozisyonundayken 'hayır, yapamam' demeyi öğretmek benim için rahatlatıcı."
"Başkalarının sınırlarını belirlemesinde yardımcı olmak harika, özellikle de kendi sınırlarımı aştığım zamanlar."
"Luteal fazda veya liderlik pozisyonundayken 'hayır' demeyi öğretmek bana güç veriyor, çünkü kendimi çok yorduğum zamanlarda kendim için de aynı şeyi yapmamı sağlıyor."
"Her zaman 'evet' demek yerine 'hayır' demenin gücünü keşfetmek inanılmaz bir deneyim, bu da kendimizi aşırı yüklememizi önlememize yardımcı oluyor."
"Kendimi başkalarına yardım etmeye adadığım için kendime karşı dürüst olmakta zorlanıyorum, bu yüzden insanları kendi sınırlarını belirlemeye teşvik etmek kendime de yardımcı oluyor."
"Su içeren herhangi bir şey - banyo, duş veya sadece bitkileri hortumla sulamak ve ayaklarımı püskürtmek."
"Herhangi bir suyla temas eden şey, örneğin banyo yapmak, duş almak veya sadece bitkilere su vermek ve ayaklarımı sulamak."
"Banyo, duş, hatta sadece bitkilere su vermek ve ayaklarıma su sıçratmak bile suyu içeren eylemlerdir."
"Banyo, duş veya sadece bitkileri sulamak ve ayaklarımı sulamak gibi suyu içeren herhangi bir eylem hoşuma gidiyor."
"Suyla etkileşim kurduğum her an, banyo, duş veya bitkilere sulamak, bana keyif veriyor."
"Suyu içeren her şey, örneğin banyo, duş veya bitkileri sulamak bile beni rahatlatıyor."
Nasıl olsa onları iptal edeceğim! Gelme baskısı ve iptal etme suçunun olmaması yardımcı olur.
"Bu projeyi iptal edip etmemem konusunda baskı altında hissediyorum, ancak nasıl olsa iptal edeceğim!"
"Onlara çoktan kararımı söyledim, nasıl olsa iptal edeceğim! "
"İptal etmek zorunda kalacağım, bunun için çok geç, nasıl olsa iptal edeceğim!"
"Geç olmadan önce iptal etmemi sağlamak için ne gerekiyorsa yapacağım, nasıl olsa iptal edeceğim!"
"Onları ikna edemeyebilirim, ama iptal edeceğim!"
Kendimi aptalca yiyorum ama mide ağrısıyla sonuçlanmayacak şeylerde ya da buzdolabının kapısıyla ayakta durmaktan kaynaklanan utançta bir kaşıkla tereyağı yiyorum.
"Ben kendimi saçma sapan şeylerle yoruyorum ama asla midemi bozmuyorum. Mesela, ayakta durup buzdolabının kapısına bakmaktan kaynaklanan utancın üstesinden gelmek için bir kaşık tereyağı yiyebilirim."
"Öyle gereksiz şeylere takılıp kalıyorum ki, sanki buzdolabının kapısına bakmaktan utanç duyduğumda bir kaşık tereyağı yiyip kendimi teselli edermişim gibi."
"Kendime acı çektirme konusunda oldukça yetenekliyim, ama genellikle mide bulandırıcı sonuçları olan şeyler değil. Örneğin, buzdolabının kapısına bakmaktan dolayı hissettiğim utancın üstesinden gelmek için bir kaşık tereyağı yiyebilirim."
"Bazen kendime gereksiz yere yükleniyorum, sanki bir kaşık tereyağı yiyerek buzdolabının kapısına bakmaktan dolayı duyduğum utancın üstesinden gelebilirmişim gibi."
"Bana garip geliyor ama kendimi aptalca şeylerle yormak konusunda uzmanız.  Mesela, buzdolabının kapısına bakmaktan kaynaklanan utancı bastırmak için bir kaşık tereyağı yiyebilirim."
Kendimi cehennem haftası boyunca kütüphanede ağlarken buldum çünkü bir kitap seçemiyorum ve hiçbir şey ilgimi çekmiyor.
"Kütüphanede saatlerce dolaştım, bir kitap bile seçemedim, sanki tüm kitaplar bana aynı derecede ilgisizmiş gibi."
"Kütüphanenin rafları arasında kaybolmuş gibiydim, hiçbir kitap bana ilham vermiyordu, sanki bir boşluğun içindeymişim gibi."
"Kütüphanede saatlerce kitapları karıştırdım, hiçbirisi beni cezbetmedi, adeta bir kitap çölünde kaybolmuş gibiydim."
"Kütüphanedeki tüm kitaplar aynı derecede sıkıcıydı, ne okuyacağımı seçemiyordum, sanki tüm ilhamım kaçmış gibi."
"Kütüphanenin içinde yalnız başıma dolaştım, hiçbir kitap ilgimi çekmedi, sanki dünya başka bir gezegendeymiş gibi hissettim."
Gerçekten istemediğini hissettiğinde dışarı çıkmakla mücadele etmek ama daha iyi hissetmene yardımcı olduğunu bildiğin bc.
"Bildiğin işe yaramayacak olsa bile, kendimizi zorlamak zorunda kaldığımız zamanlar var."
"Aslında gitmek istemediğimde bile, bazen kendimi dışarı çıkmaya zorlamak daha iyi hissetmemi sağlıyor."
"Çıkmak her zaman kolay olmasa da, kendimi dışarı çıkmaya zorladığımda kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum."
"Bilsem bile işime yaramayacak, yine de kendimi zorlayıp dışarı çıkıyorum."
"Gitmek istemiyorum ama biliyorum ki, çıkmak beni daha iyi hissettirecek."
Matt Haig'e zihinsel olarak dengesiz olmanın sorun olmadığını hatırlatan kitaplar için çok ilgi duydum. Kendisi anksiyete ve depresyonla savaşır ve bu konuda inanılmaz derecede ilgili yazma şeklini bulurum.
Matt Haig'in ruh sağlığı ile ilgili deneyimlerini bu kadar açık ve dürüst bir şekilde paylaşması beni gerçekten etkiledi.
"Matt Haig'in ruh sağlığı mücadeleleri hakkında yazdığı her şeyi okuyorum, onun samimiyeti ve açıklığı beni gerçekten etkiliyor."
Matt Haig'in kitaplarının zihinsel sağlığı konuşmayı normalleştirmek ve mücadele edenler için bir umut kaynağı yaratmada çok önemli bir rol oynadığını düşünüyorum.
"Matt Haig'in zihinsel sağlık ile ilgili deneyimlerini paylaşmak konusunda gösterdiği cesaret, anksiyete ve depresyonla boğuşan insanlara çok yardımcı oluyor."
"Matt Haig'in yazdıkları, anksiyete ve depresyon gibi konuların tabu olmaması gerektiğini hatırlatıyor."
"Eskiden bunun için çok kötüydüm ama bunun yardımcı olduğunu fark ettiğimde, sadece bu konuda kendime karşı sert olmaya çalışıyorum."
Bu konuda çok kötüydüm ama bunun faydalı olduğunu fark ettiğimde kendimi zorlamaya karar verdim.
Geçmişte bu konuda çok başarısız olmuştum ancak faydalı olduğunu fark ettiğimde kendimi motive etmeye çalıştım.
Bu konuda gerçekten berbattım ama faydalı olduğunu fark ettiğimde kendimi disipline etmeye başladım.
Eskiden bu konuda çok kötüydüm ancak bunun faydalı olduğunu anlayınca kendime daha fazla baskı yapmaya başladım.
Bu konuda çok zorluk çekiyordum ama bunun faydalı olduğunu fark ettiğimde kendimi daha fazla çalışmaya zorladım.
PMDD beynim bana şu anda her sorunu çözmem gerektiğini söylüyor (ve aynı zamanda her şeyin bir sorun olduğunu söylüyor)
PMDD beynim şu anda tüm dünyayı kurtarmam gerektiğine inanıyor (ve aynı zamanda dünyanın kurtarılmaya ihtiyacı olduğunu söylüyor).
PMDD beynim şu anda mükemmel bir yemek pişirmem gerektiğini söylüyor (ve aynı zamanda her şeyin yanlış olduğunu söylüyor).
PMDD beynim şu anda tüm arkadaşlarımla görüşmem gerektiğini söylüyor (ve aynı zamanda hiçbir arkadaşımın beni sevmediğini söylüyor).
PMDD beynim şu anda tüm ev işlerini bitirmem gerektiğini söylüyor (ve aynı zamanda asla bitiremeyeceğimi söylüyor).
PMDD beynim şu anda tüm dünyaya seyahat etmem gerektiğini söylüyor (ve aynı zamanda hiç para harcayacak param olmadığını söylüyor).
"Bunun refahım için bir gereklilik olduğunu kendime tekrar etmek zorunda kaldım. Bunu yapmak, beynimi dışarıda yapabilmem için yeterince uzun süre susturdu."
"Bu, yapmam gereken bir şeydi, çünkü iyi hissetmemi sağlıyordu."
"Bu, bana rahatlama getirecek bir şeydi ve bunu yapmam gerekiyordu."
Sıkıntılı hissetmemek için bunu yapmaya kendimi zorlamalıydım.
"Bunu yapmak bana iyi hissettirdiği için, kendimi zorlamak zorunda kaldım."
"Bunu yapmak, bana huzur veriyordu ve bunu yapmam gerekiyordu."
"Hayatımdaki insanlara şu anda umursamadığım için kızgınım ve ailemin beni başa çıkma becerileri olmadan yetiştirdiği için kızgınım... Beni şişman, aptal ve kullanışsız ve hassas kıldığı için evrene kızgınım."
"Hayatımın bu noktaya gelmesinde payı olan herkese kızgınım, çünkü beni desteklemekten ziyade beni yıkan bir dünya ve beni yaralayan bir aileye sahip oldum."
Beni duygusal olarak savunmasız ve yetersiz bırakan bir aileye ve bana karşı soğuk davranan insanlara karşı büyük bir öfke duyuyorum.
"Kimse bana sahip çıkmadı, kimse beni korudu, kimse benimle ilgilendi, beni bu kadar kırılgan ve çaresiz bırakan bu dünyaya kızgınım."
Hayatımın her alanında başarısızlıklar yaşamama neden olan kendimi zayıf hissetmeme sebep olan aileme ve çevreme öfkeliyim.
"Bu dünyada yalnız hissediyorum, kimse beni anlamıyor, kimse benimle ilgilenmiyor ve beni böyle yapan evrene karşı derin bir öfke besliyorum."
"Tamamen kendini sabote etme arzusuyla eşlik eden yıkıcı düşünceler. Özellikle ilişkimde. Düşüncelerimin gerçek olduğuna kendimi ikna edebilmem bazen dürüst olmam için beni korkutuyor. ""Partnerim beni aldatıyor""... ""benden nefret ediyorlar ve sadece benimle sıkışmış hissediyorlar ve ayrılarak duygularımı incitmek istemiyorlar""... *ortak yeni bir arkadaş ediniyor * ""bu yüzden kesinlikle yeni şeyler için beni terk edecekler"" Belki de bu yeni kişiyi yenmeliyim"
"Kendimi sabote etme arzusu, ilişkimde yıkıcı düşüncelerin ortaya çıkmasına neden oluyor. "
"Özellikle ilişkimde, gerçek dışı düşüncelerle başa çıkmak çok zor. "
"Duygularımın doğru olduğuna kendimi ikna etmeye çalışmak, gerçekçi olmamı engelliyor ve ilişkimi mahvediyor. "
"Partnerimin beni aldattığını düşünmek beni deli ediyor, ama bu düşüncelerden kurtulamıyorum. "
"Bu yeni arkadaşının beni terk etmek için bir bahane olduğunu düşünüyorum, ama belki de haklı değilim."
2011'den beri günlük zoloft kullanıyorum ve güzel bir şekilde işe yaradı - son birkaç aya kadar hiç şüphesiz perimenopozdayım. Zaten 150 MG zoloft'um var ve dozu artırabileceğimi ya da artırmak istediğimi bile bilmiyorum. Ruh hali değişimleri ile başa çıkamıyorum ve yakın zamana kadar körfezde tutulan Öfke Canavarına dönüşemiyorum!
"Zoloft bana uzun zamandır yardımcı oluyordu, ancak perimenopozun etkileriyle başa çıkmakta zorlanıyorum, sanki ilaç artık eskisi kadar etkili değilmiş gibi."
Artık 150 MG Zoloft alıyorum ve daha fazla doz almam gerekip gerekmediğini bilmiyorum. Ruh halim çok dalgalı ve eskiden kontrol altında tuttuğum öfke şimdi kontrol edilemez hale geldi.
Perimenopozla ilgili hormon dalgalanmaları yüzünden Zoloft'un işe yaramaması beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor. Eskiden sakinleşmeme yardımcı olan ilaç artık işe yaramıyor.
"Ruh halim çok kötü, Zoloft'un etkisi eskisi kadar güçlü değil. Dozu artırmanın bir çözüm olup olmadığını bilmiyorum, ancak bu durumu düzeltmem gerekiyor."
"Öfke kontrolümü kaybetmeye başladım ve Zoloft'un artık bu öfkeyi yatıştırmada etkili olmadığını düşünüyorum. Dozu artırmak faydalı olabilir mi, emin değilim."
O kadar motivasyonsuz hissediyorum ki hiçbir şey yapamıyorum ve ağlamak istiyorum ama gözyaşım yok.

O zaman geldiğinde, sürekli olarak arka planda oynadığını, bazen bile zar zor dinlediğimi buluyorum, ama arada bir beni hormonal kargaşadan tamamen çıkaran bir şey söylüyor. Sadece birkaç dakikalığına olsa bile. Gerçekten yardımcı oluyor. O gerçekten sert ve iyimser bir sestir. Beyninin bazı zamanlarını yeniden çalışarak geçirdiğimi hissediyorum."
"İlaç eksikliğine, her zaman bir terapi seansı gibi hissettiğim bir dizi alışkanlıkla katlanıyorum... Sonrasında, sürekli olarak arka planda çalmaya devam ettiğini fark ediyorum, bazen onu zor duyuyorum, ancak bazen de beni tüm kaosun içinden çıkaran bir şey söylüyor."

"İkinci bebeğime sahip olduğumdan beri, luteal sahnemde hissettiğim öfke ve sabırsızlık dayanılmaz. Dün onu tamamen kaybettim ve oğlumun önünde kocama bağırdım. Suçluluğum beni yutuyor. Kendime çok kızgınım. Öz farkındalığım varsa, ailemle başa çıkabilmem ve önlem alabilmem gerektiğini hissediyorum.

O kadar kızgınım ki kendime bağırıyordum. Sadece bunun durmasını istiyorum. Hayatımın ve çocuklarımın tadını çıkarmak istiyorum ve duygularımı kontrol edemiyorum. Her zaman çok üzgünüm.... Tekrar mutlu hissetmek için çok çaresizim. Gülmek ve sakin hissetmek için çok çaresizim. Çok çaresizim. Artık üzgün olmak istemiyorum.

"Sabah uyandığımda kendimi kontrolsüz hissediyordum, sanki içimde bir fırtına kopuyordu."
"Son zamanlarda AC'min patladığını ve hala çok sıcak olduğumu fark ettim. Sıcaklığım yok, ancak kelimenin tam anlamıyla beni soğutmaya yardımcı olabilecek tek şey üzerimde bir fan."
Klimam bozuldu ve evim inanılmaz derecede sıcak. Isınmam yok ama bu ısıda tek umudum bir vantilatör.
"Sıcaklıklar dayanılmaz hale geldi, klimam ise tamir için servise gitti. Üzerimde bir vantilatörle bile bunalıyorum."
"Bu ısıdan bunaldım, klimam ise tamir için servise gitti. Vantilatörle bile serinleyemiyorum."
"Evim fırın gibi, klimam ise arızalandı. Sıcaklığım yok, bu yüzden de sadece vantilatörle bu sıcağa dayanmaya çalışıyorum."
"Klima bozuldu ve evim kavurucu sıcakta. Sıcaklığım yok, sadece vantilatör beni biraz olsun rahatlatıyor."
"Stresliyim ve aşırı uyarılıyorum ve sadece alana ihtiyacım var. Tetikleniyorum, spazm ediyorum ve hareket ediyorum, böylece beni yalnız bırakacak."
"Çok yorgunum ve bunalmış hissediyorum, sadece biraz sakinleşmeye ihtiyacım var."

Bir saat boyunca kontrolsüzce ağladım
Çok üzgündüm ve ağlamaktan kendimi alamadım.
Hislerimle baş edemiyordum ve gözyaşlarım durmak bilmiyordu.
Bir saat boyunca ağlamaktan başka bir şey yapamadım.
Kendimi kontrol edemeyerek ağladım durdum.
"Ağlamayı bırakamıyordum, saatlerce devam etti."
"5 gündür bunun üzerindeyim ve ruh hali iyileştirmelerini fark ettim, ancak aynı zamanda yorgunluk, uykusuzluk ve korkunç bir migren krizi gibi bazı rahatsız edici yan etkileri de zorluyorum."

Ben sadece STRESSSSSSEDDDDDD! Beni sakinleştirmek için zaten biraz Xanax aldım. Sadece kendi yağımda eriyerek sıkıştım. Fiziksel olarak felç oldum
"Bugün çok stresliyim, hiçbir şey yapacak gücüm yok."
"Stresten kırılıyorum, sanki vücudum çalışmayı reddediyor."
"Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum, yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok."
"Her şey çok fazla, hiçbir şey umurumda değil."
Sanki dünyanın yükü omuzlarımda gibi hissediyorum.
Bir şey bulamadığım için sinirlenebilirim ya da işten bir şey için strese girebilir ya da sinirlenebilirim... Bu üzüntülerin doğal olduğunu ve PMDD'nin ne zaman ya da ne zaman gerçekleşeceğini hissediyorum... Kontrol edemediğim bu tıbbi durumdan dolayı ne kadar çok şey yaşadığımı bildiği için çok acı hissediyorum.
PMDD'nin neden olduğu bu iniş çıkışlı duygusal değişimlere karşı koymaya çalıştığımda kendimi yetersiz hissediyorum.
Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak hissettiğim bu ani ve kontrol edilemez değişiklikleri başkalarına açıklamak beni çok yoruyor.
"Öfke, üzüntü ve stresle dolu bu dönemlerde kendimi desteklemek için çabalıyorum ve bunun normal olduğunu hatırlatmaya çalışıyorum."
Her ay yaşadığım bu duygusal iniş çıkışları beni gerçekten yoruyor ve gücümü etkiliyor.
PMDD ile yaşamayı öğrenmek ve kendimi anlamak çok zor ama bu duruma rağmen hayatta kalmaya devam ediyorum.

Onunla konuşurken her şeyi çok ciddiye almaktan kaçınmaya çalışıyorum çünkü o her şeyi çok yürekten alıyor ve her şey spiral şeklinde kontrolden çıkıyor.
O çok hassas olduğu için küçük bir yorum bile büyük bir tartışmaya yol açabilir ve sonra da ilişkinin parçalarını bir araya getirmek zorunda kalırım.

Normalde benim için sadece belirsiz bir şekilde çekici olacak herhangi bir adama tırmanmak istiyorum... gerçekten bir erkeğin bana iyi davranmasını veya sevimli görünmesini içeren herhangi bir şeye.

"Son beş yıldır intihara meyilli hissediyorum, yılda on kez, bir seferde iki hafta boyunca düz bir şekilde....ben şimdi ve sonra boğazımı kesmek için bir dürtü olmadığını söylersem yalan olurdu... Bazen sadece altta yatan bir dizi sorun varsa pmdd semptomlarımın kötüleştiğini fark ediyorum... Ayrıca yaş düşmanım gibi bir canlanma hissediyorum: Beden DYSMORPHIA! ve yüksek işlevli duygular."
"Son beş yıldır duygusal olarak çok zor zamanlar geçiriyorum, yılda on kez iki hafta boyunca yoğun bir şekilde..."
"İntihar düşünceleri ve dürtülerine sık sık kapılıyorum, her zaman olmasa da..."
"Özellikle PMDD semptomlarım kötüleştiğinde, kendimi çok çaresiz ve umutsuz hissediyorum..."
"Kendimi sürekli olarak yeterince iyi olmamaya ve mükemmelliğe ulaşamamaya zorluyorum, bu da beni çok yoruyor..."
"Yaşlanmak korkutucu ve acı verici olabilir, özellikle bedeninizle barışık değilken..."
"İki hafta boyunca en kötü halim olmuştum, dayanılmaz... Son iki haftaya baktığımda kendimi deli gibi hissediyorum."
"Son iki haftada kendimi hiç olmadığım kadar kötü hissettim, dayanılmazdı."
"İki haftalık bir kabus gibiydi, her şey çok kötüydü, delirmek üzereydim."
"Geçen iki hafta inanılmaz derecede zor geçti, neredeyse çıldıracaktım."
"İki haftalık bir cehennemden geçiyorum, kendimi gerçekten kötü hissediyorum."
"Son iki hafta çok yoğun ve stresliydi, neredeyse dayanamayacaktım."
"Doğru düşünemiyorum ya da duygularımı düzenleyemiyorum, bazen kontrolsüzce ağlıyorum ve ciddi bir beyin sisi yaşıyorum. Uyuyamıyorum. Kramplardan dolayı zayıflatıcı bir ağrı içindeyim."
"Çok yorgunum, düşünmek bile zorlaşıyor. Duygularım beni kontrol ediyor, ağlamaktan kendimi alamıyorum."
"Beynim bulanık, hiçbir şey net değil. Uykuya dalamıyorum, sürekli kramplar çekiyorum."
"Vücudum sürekli ağrı içinde, bu ağrı beni zayıflatıyor. Düşünemiyorum, duygularımı düzenleyemiyorum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, hislerim beni ele geçiriyor. Uyuyamıyorum, kramplar beni deli ediyor."
"Ağrı ve yorgunluktan dolayı düşünmek bile zorlaşıyor. Bu beyin sisi beni mahvediyor, uyuyamıyorum."
"Benim dönemimden 2 gün önce tüm cehennem gevşer. Bu sahip olmak gibidir...Kanamaya kadar öfkelenirim. Eğer buna sahip değilseniz, bazen kendi zihninizde gerçek cehennemde olmanın nasıl bir şey olduğunu bilemezsiniz."
"İnsanlar öfkenin nasıl bir şey olduğunu tam olarak anlamadan önce, hayatlarının zorluklarından sadece bir şekilde yara almış olurlar."
"Bu öfke, tüm bunlara katlanmak zorunda olduğumuzu anladığımızda, tam olarak yaşamamış olduğumuz halde yaşadığımız cehennem."
"Benim dönemimden önce, her şey daha basitti, şimdi ise tam bir kaos ve öfke dolu."
"Bu öfkeyi anlamak, içinde bulunduğumuz cehennemden kurtulmamız için tek yol."
"Yaşadığımız acı, bazen kendi cehennemimizi yaratmamıza neden olur, ve bu öfke, bunu hissetmenin tek yoludur."
"İlk olarak PMS belirtilerimden bahsetmeye başladım, PMDD'ye sahip olabileceğimden şüphelenmeden önce"
"Başlangıçta sadece PMS belirtilerinden bahsediyordum, PMDD olabileceğim aklıma gelmemişti."
"PMS belirtilerimden bahsetmeye başlamıştım, ama PMDD olabileceğimi düşünmüyordum."
"İlk başta, sadece PMS belirtilerimden bahsediyordum, PMDD olabileceğimi düşünmemiştim."
"PMS belirtilerimden bahsetmeye başladığımda, PMDD olabileceğim aklıma bile gelmemişti."
"PMS belirtilerimden şikayet ediyordum, ama PMDD'ye sahip olduğumu fark etmemiştim."
"2017 yılında harika bir hamilelikten sonra depresyon ve anksiyete yaşadım. Sonunda bu, bariz alternatif iyi ve çok kötü zamanlara (anksiyete, depresyon, yorgunluk vb.) çözüldü."
2017 yılında harika bir hamilelik geçirdim ancak o mutluluk kısa sürdü. Depresyon ve anksiyeteyle mücadele etmek zorunda kaldım.
"Doğum sonrası depresyon ve anksiyeteyle başa çıkmak çok zordu. Ama sonunda daha iyi zamanlar geldi, tabii ki hala zorluklar olsa da."
Hamileliğim ve doğum sonrası dönem oldukça zorlu geçti. Depresyon ve anksiyeteyle mücadele ettim ama şimdi daha iyiyim.
"Çocuğumun doğumu hayatımı değiştirdi ama maalesef depresyon ve anksiyete de geldi. Şimdi daha iyi hissediyorum, ama o dönem gerçekten zordu."
"2017 yılının doğumuyla beraber depresyon ve anksiyete de geldi. Hayatımın en zorlu dönemiydi, ama sonunda daha iyi zamanlar geldi."
"Gençken bile her zaman herkesinkinden farklı olduğumu hissettim, ancak depresyon, endişe ve umutsuzluk beni korkutan en kötü şey."
"Başkalarından farklı olmak hep benimle oldu, ancak içimdeki karamsarlık ve umutsuzluk beni hep korkuttu."
"Çocukluğumdan beri farklı olduğumu biliyordum, ama depresyon, kaygı ve umutsuzluk, kendimi gerçekte hissetmeme engel olan tek şey."
"Hep bir şekilde herkesin dışında olduğumu hissettim, ancak depresyon, endişe ve umutsuzluk beni hep geride tuttu."
"Ben her zaman farklı biriydim, ama depresyonun, endişenin ve umutsuzluğun beni tüketmesi beni en çok korkuttu."
"Gençliğimden beri hep farklı hissettim, ancak depresyon, endişe ve umutsuzluk bana en büyük korkularımı yaşattı."
Ayda birkaç gün tamamen deli bir insan oluyorum sadece öfkeli bir canavarım ve mantıksız olduğumu biliyorum ama bundan kurtulamıyorum.
"Bazen hislerim beni tamamen ele geçiriyor, öfkeyle doluyorum ve hiçbir şey mantıklı gelmiyor."
"Birkaç gün boyunca kendimi kontrol edemediğimi hissediyorum, sadece öfkeyle dolu bir canavar gibi oluyorum."
"Bazen öfkemin beni tamamen ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum, mantıksızca davranıyorum ve bunu durduramam."
"Öfkeyle dolu bir canavar gibi hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor, mantıksızca davranıyorum ve kendimi durduramam."
"Bazen öfke beni ele geçiriyor, mantıksızca davranıyorum ve bu hisse karşı koyamıyorum."
Döngümün yarısı için bir iblisim
"İçimde bir şeylerin bozuk olduğunu, bir iblisin beni kontrol ettiğini hissediyorum."
"Kendimi sürekli bir döngüde yakaladım, sanki bir iblis beni yönetiyor."
"Hayatımın yarısı kontrolsüz ve karanlık, adeta bir iblis tarafından yönlendiriliyor."
"Bu döngünün çıkışını bulmam gerekiyor, yoksa iblisin pençesinde kalacağım."
"İblis gibi, beni sürekli aynı hatalara sürükleyen bir şey var."
"Zaten maksimum antidepresanlar üzerinde, bu yüzden gerçekten buradan nereye gittiğimi bilmiyorum. Tek bildiğim daha da zayıflatıcı hale geliyor."
"İlaçlarımın dozajını daha fazla artıramam, bu yüzden ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, çünkü durumum giderek kötüleşiyor."
"En yüksek dozda antidepresan kullanıyorum, ama durumum daha da kötüleşiyor, gerçekten ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Bu ilaçlar beni daha da kötüleştiriyor, ancak daha fazlasını kullanamıyorum, artık hiçbir çarem kalmadı."
"Maksimum dozda antidepresan kullandığım halde, durumum daha da kötüleşiyor, bu gerçekten çok korkutucu."
"Daha fazla ilaç alamam, çünkü zaten maksimum dozdayım. Bu durumdan nasıl çıkacağımı bilmiyorum."
Daha da kötüleştiğini bilmiyordum.
Daha da kötüleşeceğini tahmin etmemiştim.
Durumun bu kadar kötüye gideceğini düşünmemiştim.
Bu kadar kötü olacağını hiç beklemiyordum.
Her şeyin daha da kötüleşeceğini fark etmemiştim.
Daha da kötü bir hale gelebileceğini aklımın ucundan bile geçirmemiştim.
'2. ergenlik' dediğim bir şeyden geçtim ve o zaman tepeden aşağı indi. Yeni dönem acıları
"İkinci bir ergenlik döneminden geçtiğimi hissediyorum, her şey altüst oldu."
"Sanki hayatımın yeni bir bölümüne girdim, bir anda her şey değişti."
"Geçtiğimiz aylarda hayatımda büyük değişimler oldu, kendimi bambaşka bir insan gibi hissediyorum."
"Yeni bir benlik keşfettim, sanki hayatımı sıfırdan başlatıyorum."
"Bu dönemde yaşadığım değişimler, beni bambaşka biri yaptı, şimdi her şey çok farklı."
Tamamen farklı bir insan gibi hissediyorum ve dönemlerimin kendileri her zamankinden daha kötü. Mantıklı düşünme yeteneğini tamamen kaybediyorum. Birden bire sadece söylemek istiyorum.
"Son zamanlarda kendimi yabancı hissediyorum, sanki eski ben değilim gibi. Ayrıca ruh halim çok dalgalı, her şey beni sinirlendiriyor."
"Bir tuhaf haldeyim, her şey beni sinir ediyor. Sanki kontrolümü kaybediyorum gibi hissediyorum."
Eskiden bu kadar agresif değildim. Sanki bir şey beni içten içe yiyor gibi.
"Sanki her şey çok hızlı geçiyor. Kendimde değilim, her şey bana çok tuhaf geliyor."
Duygularım beni tamamen ele geçirdi. Mantıklı düşünme yeteneğimi kaybettim ve sadece içimdeki her şeyi haykırmak istiyorum.
"Öfkem ve ruh sağlığım her yıl yoğunlaşıyor, ama 30'a bastığımdan beri dönemin kendisi ölüyordu. Eskiden en acımasız ağır dönemler geçiriyordu... ve bu öfke ve paranoyanın patlamasıyla sona eriyordu."
"Öfke patlamalarım giderek daha sık ve yoğunlaşıyor, ama 30'a bastığımda eskisi kadar acımasız olmadıklarını fark ettim."
"Her yıl öfkemin ve ruh sağlığımın kötüleştiğini hissediyorum, ama 30'dan sonra bu ağır dönemler eskisi kadar şiddetli değil."
"Yıllardır öfkem ve ruh sağlığımla mücadele ediyorum, ancak 30'lu yaşlarımda bu dönemler artık eskisi kadar yoğun değil."
"30 yaşından önce öfke patlamaları ve paranoyalarım çok yoğun ve acımasızdı, ama şimdi biraz daha kontrol altındalar."
"Öfkem ve paranoyanın kontrolünü kaybettiğim günler artık eskisi kadar sık değil, ancak 30'dan sonra da hala zorlu zamanlar geçiriyorum."
"Belirtilerim daha da kötüleşti, 37 yaşına geldiğimden beri... Son birkaç yıl hayatımın en stresli yıllarından bazılarıydı, bu yüzden semptomlarım şiddetlendi."
"Bu son zamanlardaki yoğun stresin vücudumu gerçekten etkilediğini düşünüyorum, özellikle de son birkaç yıldır belirtilerim çok arttı."
"Özellikle son zamanlarda çok yoruluyorum ve sürekli bir baskı altında hissediyorum, sanki hayatımın bu dönemi benim için çok zorlayıcıymış gibi."
"Geçtiğimiz yıllarda geçirdiğim zorluklara rağmen, vücudumun verdiği sinyalleri artık daha ciddi bir şekilde ele almam gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"37 yaşına geldim ve bu yaştan sonra bazı sağlık sorunlarının baş göstermesi çok doğal, ama son zamanlardaki stres durumu her şeyi daha da kötüleştirdi."
"Hayatın her geçen gün daha da zorlaştığını hissediyorum, iş, aile, her şey çok yoğun. Bu da vücudumda çeşitli belirtilerin ortaya çıkmasına yol açtı."
Benimki ben gençken başladı ve aslında yaşla biraz daha iyileştim ve nasıl yönetileceğini buldum.
Bu durum benim için genç yaşta başladı ve zamanla daha iyi bir şekilde yönetebilmeyi öğrendim.
Gençliğimde başladı bu alışkanlık ama zamanla ona daha hakim olmayı öğrendim.
"Başlangıçta zorlandığım bu durum, yaşla birlikte daha iyi yönetmeyi öğrendim."
"Gençliğimde fark ettiğim bu sorun, yıllar içinde daha iyi bir şekilde kontrol altına alınabilir hale geldi."
"Genç yaşta ortaya çıkan bu durum, deneyimle birlikte daha kolay yönetilebilir hale geldi."
Ruh sağlığım beni endişelendiriyor ve bazı fiziksel şeyler de var ve bunun gibi tipik kramplar var.
"Fiziksel olarak da bazı sorunlarım var ve ruh halim de beni endişelendiriyor, bu da kramp gibi belirtilerle kendini gösteriyor."
"Ruh halim beni endişelendiriyor ve ayrıca bazı fiziksel belirtiler de yaşıyorum, örneğin kramplar."
"Hem ruhsal hem de fiziksel sağlığımla ilgili endişelerim var, özellikle de kramplar gibi belirtilerle."
"Ruh sağlığımın yanı sıra, fiziksel olarak da bazı sıkıntılar yaşıyorum, örneğin düzenli kramplar."
Kramplar gibi fiziksel semptomlarla birlikte ruhsal sağlığım da beni endişelendiriyor.
"Hala her ay döngü yapıyorum, tıpkı daha önce olduğu gibi, dönem olmadan."
"Her ay aynı döngü içindeyim, dönemsiz ve yorucu."
"Aynı rutin, aynı sıkıcı döngü, sanki bir dönem olmamış gibi sürüyor."
"Zaman durmuş gibi, her ay aynı şeyler tekrar ediyor, tıpkı öncesinde olduğu gibi."
"Dönem bitti ama ben hala aynı döngü içindeyim, sanki zaman durmuş gibi."
"Her ay aynı, dönemsiz, yorucu bir döngü, tıpkı öncesinde olduğu gibi."
"Beni intihara terk eden gelişmiş PND. Geçen ay 40 yaşına girdim ve sadece 3 hafta önce rahatsız edici düşüncelere kapıldıktan sonra PMDD teşhisi kondu, ruh halimle mücadele ettiğimi fark ettim, sitalopram'a geri döndüm ve CBT'ye başladım."
"PMDD teşhisinden sonra yaşadığım ruhsal iniş çıkışlar beni çok zorladı, kendimi tamamen çaresiz hissettim."
"40 yaşına girdikten sonra bir anda başlayan PMDD, hayatımı altüst etti ve beni intihara sürükleyen düşüncelere kapılmama neden oldu."
PMDD'nin ani ve şiddetli etkisi beni hayatımı sorgulamaya ve her şeyden vazgeçme düşüncesine sürükledi.
"Ruh halimdeki ani değişimler ve kontrolsüz duygular beni çaresizliğe sürükledi, kendimi intihara sürüklenmiş gibi hissettim."
PMDD teşhisiyle birlikte gelen yoğun ruhsal bunalım beni hayatımı sorgulamaya ve intihar düşüncelerine götürdü.
Şimdi her zamankinden daha fazla strese güveniyorum
Şimdi her zamankinden daha fazla stresle başa çıkabileceğime inanıyorum.
Eskiden stres beni çok etkilerdi ama şimdi daha iyi başa çıkabiliyorum.
Artık stresle başa çıkmak için daha fazla araç ve yöntem öğrendim.
Stresle mücadele etmek için kendimi daha güçlü hissediyorum.
"Geçmişte strese çok kapılıyordum, ama şimdi daha sakin ve dengeliyim."
"Ben gençken çok daha iyi pmdd düşükleri yönetmek gibi görünüyor. Ben alkol içmemek ve daha fazla uyku almak biliyorum, egzersiz ve benim kan şekeri düzeyleri sabit tutmak."
"Yaşlandıkça, premenstrual disforik bozukluğun etkilerini daha zor kontrol altında tuttuğumu hissediyorum."
Eskiden pmdd belirtilerini şimdi olduğumdan çok daha iyi yönetiyordum.
"Gençliğimde, alkol içmekten kaçınmak, yeterince uyumak, egzersiz yapmak ve kan şekeri seviyelerimi dengede tutmak pmdd belirtilerimi kontrol altında tutmama yardımcı oluyordu."
"Günümüzde pmdd belirtilerini kontrol altında tutmakta zorlanıyorum, ancak gençken bu konuda daha iyiydim."
"Gençken pmdd belirtilerini daha kolay yönetebiliyordum; yeterince uyumak, alkol içmekten kaçınmak, egzersiz yapmak ve kan şekeri seviyelerimi kontrol altında tutmak yardımcı oluyordu."
Piştim.
Artık dayanamıyorum.
Sinirlerim bozuldu.
Yeter artık!
Bu durumdan bıktım.
Daha fazla dayanamam.
"Adhd, endometriozis ve otizmden şüphelendim. Bu sefer kaygı listelerden çıktı. Aşama 4 endo'm var ve bu yardımcı olmuyor. Ama ilaç alıyorum (ssri, duloxetine, çok yardımcı oluyor!) ve dozumu artırdım ve bu yardımcı oldu."
Endometriozis tedavisi için kullandığım ilaçların yan etkilerinden dolayı zor zamanlar geçiriyorum.
Otizm ve adhd teşhislerinin yanı sıra endişe de yaşıyorum ve bu da tedaviyi zorlaştırıyor.
"Tüm bu sorunlarla başa çıkmak gerçekten yorucu, ancak ilaçların işe yaraması beni umutlandırıyor."
"Endometriozis, adhd ve otizm benim için günlük yaşamı zorlaştırıyor ancak en azından destekleyici bir doktorum var."
Bu hastalıklar beni çok yordu ancak iyi haber şu ki ilaçlar işe yarıyor ve bu da beni rahatlatıyor.
Kötüleşmeye rağmen semptomları daha iyi yönetebileceğimi hissediyorum.
Rahatsızlığım ağırlaşmasına rağmen kendimi daha güçlü hissediyorum.
"Durumum kötüleşse de, onunla daha iyi başa çıkabileceğimi düşünüyorum."
"Her şey daha da zorlaşmasına rağmen, mücadele etme gücüm arttı."
"Sıkıntılarım artmasına rağmen, iyimserliğimi kaybetmedim."
"Durum kötüye gidiyor olsa da, daha sakin ve kontrol sahibiyim."
"Aylık olarak, dönemimde ortaya çıkan intihar eğilimi ile ölümüme sürüklenmemekle mücadele ediyorum. Ruh halimle başa çıkmak gerçekten zor ve geçene kadar kendimi diğerlerinden uzaklaştırmam gerekiyor, çünkü aksi takdirde birine kafayı takabilirdim ve bunu yaptım ve bu çok utanç vericiydi."
Aylık döngümde yaşadığım ruhsal iniş çıkışlar nedeniyle kendimi kontrol altında tutmak çok zor. 
"Bu dönemde duygusal olarak çok kırılgan oluyorum, bu yüzden kendime biraz uzaklaşmam gerekiyor."
Kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum ve bu da beni depresyona sürüklüyor.
Sanki hayatımın kontrolünü kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum ve bu çok korkutucu.
Beni anlayan çok az insan var ve bu da beni çok yalnız hissettiriyor.
"20 yıl önce yaptığımdan daha fazla strese sahibim, bu yüzden belki de PMDD daha kötü görünüyor."
"20 yıl önce olduğundan daha yorgunum, bu yüzden PMDD'nin etkileri daha belirgin olabilir."
" Eskiden bu kadar endişeli değildim, şimdi PMDD semptomları daha kötü gibi görünüyor."
" Yaşlandıkça, stres seviyem arttı, bu yüzden PMDD daha yoğun hissettiriyor."
" Geçmişte stresim daha azdı, bu yüzden PMDD'nin etkilerini bu kadar net bir şekilde göremiyorum."
" Artık daha fazla sorumluluğum var, bu yüzden PMDD'nin semptomları daha ağır bir şekilde hissediyorum."
PMDD'yi iki yıl önce bir anda geliştirdim. Yıllar geçtikçe daha da kötüleşiyormuş gibi hissediyorum. Korkuyorum...
PMDD'nin hayatımı nasıl da etkilediğini düşünmek bile beni korkutuyor.
Bu hastalığın giderek kötüleşmesi beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor.
İki yıldır bu hastalıkla mücadele ediyorum ve her geçen gün daha da zorlaşıyor.
Bu hastalık hayatımı altüst etti ve gelecekten korkuyorum.
"Ne zaman geçeceğini bilmiyorum, ama artık her gün daha da fazla korkuyorum."
Her yıl yaklaşık 25 ve sonrasında daha da kötüleşir.
"Her geçen yıl durum daha da kötüleşiyor, özellikle de 25 yaşından sonra."
25 yaşından sonra her yıl bir öncekinden daha kötüye gidiyor.
"Yaş ilerledikçe her şey daha da zorlaşıyor, özellikle de 25 yaşından sonra."
25 yaşından sonra her yıl daha da kötü bir hal alıyor.
Özellikle 25 yaşından sonra her yıl daha da zorlaştığını hissediyorum.
Her yıl 30 yaşından itibaren kötüleşir
30'dan sonra her şey daha zorlaşıyor gibi geliyor.
Yaş geçtikçe her şey daha da zorlaşıyor.
30 yaşından sonra hayatın daha zor olduğunu söylüyorlar.
Herkes 30'dan sonra hayatın daha zor olduğunu söyler.
30 yaşından sonra her şey daha karmaşıklaşıyor gibi hissediyorum.
Sertralin almaya başladım ve semptomlarım çok daha yönetilebilir hale geldi. Burada ve orada kötü döngülerim var.
"Sertralin'in etkilerini hissetmeye başladım, kötü günlerim azaldı ve genel olarak kendimi çok daha iyi hissediyorum."
İlaçlarımı düzenli olarak alıyorum ve genel olarak daha iyiye gidiyorum. Elbette hala kötü günlerim oluyor ama çok daha az.
Şimdiye kadar sertralin bana oldukça iyi geldi. Daha az kaygılıyım ve kendimi çok daha sakin hissediyorum. Her şey mükemmel değil ama kesinlikle iyiye gidiyor.
Sertralin hayatımı kesinlikle kolaylaştırdı. Daha az stresli ve endişeliyim. Bazen kötü günlerim olsa da genel olarak hayatım çok daha iyi.
Kötü günlerim hala oluyor ama sertralin ile daha iyi başa çıkabiliyorum. Daha fazla sabır ve toleransım var. Bu ilaç gerçekten bana iyi geliyor.
"Burada 35, ve her zamankinden daha kötü. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkol ile kendi kendine ilaç tedavisi ve her ay bana ne olduğu hakkında hiçbir fikrim yoktu rağmen. Sadece depresyon olduğunu düşündüm."
"Yaşım 35 ve her zamankinden daha kötü durumdayım. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkolle kendimi tedavi etmeye çalıştım, her ay neler olduğunu bilmiyordum."
35 yaşındayım ve her şey daha da kötüleşiyor. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkolle kendimi tedavi etmeye çalıştım ve her ay ne olduğunu bilmiyordum.
35'im ve her zamankinden daha kötü hissediyorum. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkolle kendimi tedavi etmeye çalıştım ve her ay ne olduğunu bilmiyordum. Sadece depresyonda olduğumu düşünüyordum.
"Şu anda 35 yaşındayım ve her zamankinden daha kötü hissediyorum. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkolle kendimi tedavi etmeye çalıştım, her ay neler olduğunu bilmiyordum, sadece depresyonda olduğumu düşünüyordum."
"35 yaşındayım ve hayatım her zamankinden daha kötü. Gençken uyuşturucu ve alkolle kendimi tedavi etmeye çalıştım, her ay ne olduğunu bilmiyordum. Sadece depresyonda olduğumu düşünüyordum."
Her ay hayatım için mücadele ediyorum
Hayatın zorluklarıyla başa çıkmak için her ay büyük çaba sarf ediyorum.
Geçimimi sağlamak için her ay maddi sıkıntılarla boğuşuyorum.
Her ay geçimimi sağlamak için zorlu bir mücadele veriyorum.
Hayatın getirdiği zorluklara her ay karşı koymaya çalışıyorum.
Her ay hayatta kalmak için mücadele etmek zorunda kalıyorum.
"İyi olamadım. Temmuz ayları daha başarılı olmaya çalıştım ama daha önce ve sırasında delirdim. Daha önce hiç böyle bir endişe yaşamadım. Tüm vücudum ısı dalgası gibi tamamen uyuştu, sadece iyi değilim. Kendimi çok yerinde hissediyorum. Ben ve doğum kontrolü bir süre semptomlarımı yatıştırmaya yardımcı olmadı, ancak onları almayı bıraktım ya da belki de hormonlarım şimdi menopoza girmeden önce etkinliğini kaybediyorlardı."
"Fiziksel olarak çok iyi hissetmiyorum, Temmuz'da kendimi daha iyi hissetmeye çalıştım ama her zamanki gibi çok zor geçti, daha önce böyle bir şey yaşamadım."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum. Temmuz'da daha iyi olmaya çalıştım ama çok stresliydim, kendimi normalden çok farklı hissediyorum. Daha önce böyle bir endişe yaşamadım."
"Kendimi gerçekten iyi hissetmiyorum, özellikle de Temmuz ayında çok kötü hissettim. Bu kadar endişeli olmak beni hasta ediyor ve bu da benim için yeni bir şey. Ben de kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Kendimi çok iyi hissetmiyorum, özellikle de Temmuz ayında kendimi daha iyi hissetmeye çalıştım. Fiziksel olarak ve zihinsel olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum. Ben de bu hissi daha önce hiç yaşamadım."
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak iyi hissetmiyorum, özellikle de Temmuz ayında kendimi daha iyi hissetmeye çalıştım. Kendimi gerçekten yorgun ve bitkin hissediyorum, sanki vücudumun her tarafı uyuşmuş gibi. Bu hissi daha önce hiç yaşamadım."
Döngüm (ve çılgın günlerim) çok daha az tahmin edilebilir
"Yaşadığım hayat artık önceden kestirilemez, eskisi gibi değil."
"Artık hayatımın ne getireceği, nasıl olacağı hiç belli olmuyor."
"Eskisi gibi monoton, planlı bir hayatım yok artık, her şey değişebilir."
"Her şey çok hızlı ve beklenmedik bir şekilde değişiyor, hiç durağan bir anım yok."
"Hayatım bir dizi beklenmedik olayla dolu, her şey tahmin edilemez hale geldi."
İntihara meyilliyim.
Yaşamaktan bıktım.
Her şey çok ağır geliyor.
Beni umursayan kimse yok.
Sık sık ölüm düşünceleri geliyor aklıma.
Artık dayanamıyorum.
O kadar kötü ki geçen yıl
Geçen yıl olanlar gerçekten de çok kötüydü.
"Geçen yılın olayları aklımdan çıkmıyor, o kadar kötüydüler."
"Geçen yıl o kadar kötü geçti ki, bir an önce unutmak istiyorum."
Geçen yılın kötü anılarını hiç unutamam.
"Geçen yıl o kadar berbattı ki, bu yıl daha iyi olacağına inanmak istiyorum."
"Belirtilerimin kesinlikle daha fazla farkındayım, ruh hali sorunlarımın (bazılarının) 20'li yaşlarıma kadar döngümle bağlantılı olduğunu ve PMDD'nin 30'lu yaşlarımın başına kadar ne olduğunu öğrenmediğimi anlamadım."
Ruh halimdeki değişimleri her zaman hissetmiştim ancak şimdi onların gerçek bir tıbbi sebebi olduğunu anlıyorum.
"Daha önce ruh halimdeki değişiklikleri sadece kendimi kötü hissettiğim zamanlar olarak düşünüyordum, şimdi PMDD'nin etkisi olduğunu öğrendim."
"Artık belirtilerimin döngümle bağlantılı olduğunu anladığıma göre, daha fazla farkındayım ve kendimi daha iyi yönetebiliyorum."
"Bir süredir kendimi kötü hissetmemin sebebini arıyordum, sonunda bunun PMDD olduğunu öğrenince rahatladım."
PMDD'nin ne olduğunu öğrenmeden önce belirtilerimle mücadele etmek çok zordu.
Daha da kötüleşiyor
Durum iyice kötüye gidiyor.
Her şey daha da berbatlaşıyor.
İşler giderek daha kötüye gidiyor.
Her geçen gün daha da kötüleşiyor.
Daha da kötü bir hal alıyor.
6 ay önce tüm bu belirtilerin daha önce bu kadar kötü olmadığı için başka bir şeyden kaynaklandığına o kadar ikna oldum. Yani duygusaldım ama yönetilebilirdi.Her yıl çok daha kötüleşiyor ve henüz 25 yaşında bile değilim.
"6 ay önce, bu belirtiler bu kadar şiddetli olmadığı için farklı bir nedene bağlı olduğuna inandım. Yani, hissettiklerim zordu ama kontrol edilebilirdi."
"Geçen sene bu belirtiler bu kadar kötü değildi, bu yüzden başlangıçta başka bir şeyden kaynaklandığına inandım. Ama her yıl daha da kötüleşiyor ve durum gerçekten endişelendirmeye başladı."
"Bu belirtiler daha önce bu kadar şiddetli değildi, bu yüzden farklı bir sorun olduğuna emindim. Şimdi her yıl daha kötüleşiyor ve bu beni gerçekten korkutuyor."
"6 ay önce, bu belirtilerin başka bir şeyden kaynaklandığına emindim. Şimdi her yıl daha kötüleşiyor ve bu beni çok endişelendiriyor."
"Bu belirtiler birkaç ay önce bu kadar kötü değildi, bu yüzden başka bir şeyden kaynaklandığına emindim. Ama her geçen gün daha kötüleşiyor ve henüz çok genç olmama rağmen yaşamamın bu şekilde devam edeceğinden korkuyorum."
Geçen hafta gerçekten kötü bir günde işten çıkmak zorunda kaldım çünkü yasal olarak ağlamayı durduramadım ve en kötü vücut dismorfisine sahiptim.
"Geçen haftaki iş görüşmesi felaketti, gerçekten çok sinirliydim ve kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyordum."
"Dün sabah bir sunum yapmam gerekiyordu ve o kadar heyecanlıydım ki neredeyse ağlayacaktım, kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum."
"O toplantıdayken kendimi çok garip hissettim, sürekli kendimi eleştiriyor ve yetersiz hissediyordum."
Bu haftaki sınavda o kadar kötü performans gösterdim ki kendimi bir başarısızlık gibi hissettim ve tüm gün kötü bir ruh halindeydim.
"O gün kendime karşı çok acımasız davranıyordum, sürekli kendimi eleştiriyor ve dış görünüşümle ilgili olumsuz düşüncelere kapılıyordum."
"Ne kadar yönetilemez olduğunu bildiğim için luteal fazım her başladığında biraz korkuyorum. Kavramları anladığım gibi ama beynim hala küçük yaşam sorunları hakkında kıyamet ve kasvetli hissediyor, ""bu büyük bir şey değil"" diye rasyonelleştirebilirim ama yine de büyük bir anlaşma yapıyorum."
"Luteal fazım başlamadan önce hep biraz endişeleniyorum, ne kadar kontrol edemediğimi biliyorum çünkü."
Korkunun mantıksız olduğunu biliyorum ama luteal fazımda olduğumda beynim her zaman büyük bir felaket senaryosu yaratıyor.
Korkularımın abartılı olduğunu biliyorum ama luteal fazımda olduğumda her zaman dünyanın sonu gibi hissediyorum.
"Luteal fazım başlamadan önce her zaman biraz gergin oluyorum, vücudumun kontrolüm dışında olduğunu hissediyorum."
"Luteal fazım başladığında bu korkunç hisleri yaşıyorum, mantıksız olduğumu biliyorum ama hissetmekten kendimi alamıyorum."
20'li yaşlarımda ve 30'lu yaşların başında ortalık karmakarışıktı. O kadar şaşırdım ki artık okula geri dönüp ders çalışabilir ve hayatımı geri kazanabilirim. Öyle bir nimet oldu ki.
"20'li yaşlarımda ve 30'lu yaşlarımın başında kendimi tamamen kaybolmuş hissediyordum, hayatımda ne yapacağımı bilmiyordum."
"O zamanlar kendimi toparlayıp kendimi yeniden inşa edebileceğim bir yol bulamamıştım, kendimle barışık değildim."
"Hayatın bana attığı tokatlar beni tam anlamıyla alt üst etmişti, yoluma devam edebilmek için bir şans arıyordum."
"Her şey o kadar hızlı ve beklenmedik bir şekilde gelişti ki ne yapacağımı bilemiyordum, bir çıkış yolu arıyordum."
"Kendimi bir kaosun içinde bulmuştum, o kadar yorgundum ki bir an önce her şeyin durmasını istiyordum."
"Partner olduğumda daha da kötüleşiyor, daha da kötüleşiyor"
"Bu birliktelik bana daha çok acı veriyor, her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Partner olduğumdan beri her şey daha da kötüye gidiyor, bu durum dayanılmaz hale geliyor."
"Bu ilişkinin benim için hiçbir faydası yok, aksine her geçen gün daha kötüye gidiyor."
"Birlikte olduğumda kendimi daha mutsuz hissediyorum, her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Bu ilişki beni sadece yıpratıyor, her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
35 civarında daha da kötüleşti.
35'in üzerinde daha da kötüye gitti.
Durum daha da kötüleşti ve 35 civarında zirve yaptı.
35'e yakın bir noktaya kadar daha da kötüleşti.
Geçtiğimiz hafta 35 civarında daha da kötü bir duruma girdik.
35'ten sonra durum daha da kötüleşti.
idk nasıl daha da kötüleşebilir
"Daha kötüsü nasıl olabilir ki, bilmiyorum."
Bu durumun daha da kötüye gideceğini düşünmek bile korkutucu.

Progesteron beni bir keş gibi kaşınıyor.
Progesteronun etkisiyle sürekli bir huzursuzluk ve merak hissediyorum.
Sanki progesteron bir gizemli bir kapı aralıyor ve beni içeri çekmeye çalışıyor.
Progesteron sanki beynimin derinliklerinde bir keşif gezisi başlatıyor.
"Bu progesteronun etkisi altında, dünyayı yepyeni bir gözle görmeye başladım."
"Her şey sanki progesteronun büyüsüyle gizlenmiş bir hazine gibi, keşfedilmeyi bekliyor."
ayda 2x bozukluğu
Aylık kazancımın iki katını bozuk para olarak alıyorum.
Geçen ay aldığım bozukluk miktarının iki katını bu ay aldım.
Ayda iki kat daha fazla bozuk para biriktiriyorum.
"Gelirlerim ikiye katlandığında, daha fazla bozuk para biriktiriyorum."
Bozuklukları ikiye katlayarak ayda daha fazla para biriktirmeye çalışıyorum.
Progesteron metabolitlerine karşı bir nörosensitivitedir. PMDD'li insanlara progesteron almasını söylemek mutlak deliliktir ve doğrudan tehlikelidir.
"PMDD'li kişilerde progesteron metabolizmasıyla ilgili hassasiyet oldukça yüksektir, bu nedenle progesteron tedavisi düşünülmemelidir."
"Progesteron metabolizması ile ilgili beyin hassasiyeti göz önüne alındığında, PMDD'li kişilere progesteron verilmesi büyük risk taşır."
"PMDD'de progesteron metabolizmasına karşı hassasiyetin varlığı, bu hastalara progesteron verilmesinin riskli olduğunu göstermektedir."
"Progesteron metabolizmasının beyin üzerindeki etkilerini düşünürsek, PMDD'li kişilere progesteron vermek sorumsuzluk olur."
"PMDD'li kişilerde progesteron metabolizmasındaki hassasiyet göz önüne alındığında, bu hastalara progesteron verilmesi doğrudan tehlikelidir."
"Düşük P bizi kötüleştirirken, yüksek dozlar yardımcı olma eğilimindedir."
Düşük seviyelerde işe yaramayan ilaçlar yüksek dozlarda faydalı olabilir.
"Küçük bir miktarda fayda sağlamayan şey, büyük miktarda fayda sağlayabilir."
"Az kullanıldığında zararlı olan bir şey, çok kullanıldığında yararlı olabilir."
"Düşük dozlarda zararlı olan bir şey, yüksek dozlarda yararlı olabilir."
"Düşük dozda etkisi görülmeyen ilaçlar, yüksek dozlarda etkili olabilir."
PMDD teşhisi koymak çok zordu. Kan çalışmamda hormon dengesizliği göstermeden önce bu teşhisi aldım.
PMDD'nin ne olduğunu öğrenmek çok zaman aldı.
Doğru teşhisi almak için çok fazla doktora gitmek zorunda kaldım.
Başlangıçta doktorlar beni ciddiye almadı.
Benim yaşadığım şeyin sadece PMS olduğunu söylediler.
PMDD'nin bir gerçek hastalık olduğunu kanıtlamak zor oldu.
Son 2 yıl içinde aniden PMDD geliştirdim...Küçük başladım ve şimdi çok yüksek dozlarda progesteron alıyorum ve bununla başlamak için tüm semptomlarla oldukça sertti ama asıldım ve omg kendimi farklı bir insan gibi hissediyorum.
Son iki yıldır PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum ve durumum giderek kötüleşiyor.
Progesteron tedavisiyle PMDD semptomlarımın azaldığını görmek harika.
PMDD semptomları çok ağırdı ama ilaçlarla daha iyi hissediyorum.
PMDD tanısı konulduktan sonra çok zorlandım ama sonunda doğru tedaviyi buldum.
PMDD ile yaşamak kolay değil ama mücadele etmeye devam ediyorum.
Progesteron almaktansa vurulmayı tercih ederim!
"Progesteron almak beni gerçekten korkutuyor, vurulmak daha iyi!"
"Progesteron almak,  vurulmakla aynı etkiyi yaratıyor gibi hissettiriyor!"
"Vurulmak daha çabuk ve daha az acı verici olabilir, progesteron almak ise sonsuza dek sürecek gibi!"
"Progesteron almak gerçekten çok kötü bir deneyim, vurulmak en azından çabuk biter!"
"Progesteron almakla vurulmak arasında seçim yapmam gerekirse, vurulmayı tercih ederim!"
"Burada PMDD tanısı konan insanların büyük çoğunluğu için kesinlikle komployu kaybetmelerine, intihar etmelerine ve kendilerine zarar vermelerine neden olacak tehlikeli yanlış bilgilere karşı koyuyorum."
"PMDD tanısı konan insanların sağlığına ve güvenliğine zarar verebilecek yanlış bilgiler, gerçekte çok tehlikeli olabilir."
"Burada konuştuğumuz şey, PMDD ile yaşayan bireylerin zihinsel sağlığı için ciddi riskler oluşturan, yanlış ve zararlı bilgilerin yayılmasıdır."
"Bu tür bilgiler, PMDD tanısı konan insanların kendilerini daha kötü hissetmelerine, umutsuzluğa kapılmalarına ve hatta kendilerine zarar vermelerine neden olabilir."
"PMDD tanısı konan insanlara yönelik tehlikeli yanlış bilgiler, onların iyilik halleri ve ruhsal sağlıkları üzerinde yıkıcı etkilere sahip olabilir."
"Bu tür bilgilerle mücadele etmek, PMDD tanısı konan insanların güvenliği ve iyilik hali için hayati önem taşıyor."
PMDD'li çoğu insan östrojen baskındır ve onlara yardımcı olmak için progesterona (progestine değil) ihtiyaç duyar.
PMDD'li bireylerin çoğu östrojenle daha fazla bağlantılıdır ve onlara destek olmak için progesterona (progestine değil) ihtiyaç duyar.
"PMDD'de östrojen baskın bir hormon olduğu için, progesteronun (progestine değil) bu hastalıktan muzdarip kişilere yardımcı olabileceğini unutmamalıyız."
"PMDD'nin östrojen seviyelerindeki dalgalanmalarla ilişkili olduğunu bildiğimiz için, bu hastalığı tedavi etmek için progesteronun (progestine değil) faydalı olabileceğini düşünüyorum."
"PMDD'li kadınların çoğunun östrojen baskınlığı yaşamasına bağlı olarak, progesterona (progestine değil) ihtiyaçları olduğunu söyleyebiliriz."
"PMDD tedavisinde progesteron (progestine değil) kullanımı, hastalığın östrojen baskınlığıyla ilişkili olmasından kaynaklanmaktadır."
"Benim dönemimden bir hafta önce her ay zihinsel çöküntüler, kendini sabote etme ve intihar etme hissi yaşıyorum."
"Aylık olarak, dönemimden bir hafta önce, beni çok kötü etkileyen, umutsuzluğa sürükleyen ve hatta intihar düşüncelerine yönelten duygusal dalgalanmalar yaşıyorum."

"Her ay, dönemimden bir hafta önce, kendimi çaresiz, değersiz ve hatta intihar düşüncelerine kapılmış hissediyorum."
"Dönemin başlamasından bir hafta önce, beni içine çeken, kendimi sabote etme dürtüsü yaratan ve intihar düşüncelerine yönelten güçlü bir depresyon dalgası yaşıyorum."
"Her ay, dönemim başlamadan bir hafta önce, beni tüketen, umutsuzluğa sürükleyen ve hayata karşı isteksizleştiren bir zihinsel ve duygusal çöküş yaşıyorum."
"Suçlu hissediyorum çünkü açıkçası, teorik olarak, bunu dikkat çekmek için uydurduğumu düşünüyorsa, ama gerçekte onunla yaşamak zorunda olan benim."
"Bu konuda kendimi suçlu hissediyorum, çünkü açıkçası, bu durumu kendi çıkarım için uydurmuş gibi düşünüyor olabilir, ancak gerçekte bununla yaşamak zorunda olan benim."
"Beni suçlu hissettirdiği için rahatsız oluyorum, çünkü sanki kendi çıkarım için bu durumu yaratmış gibi düşünüyor, ancak gerçekte bunun ağır yükünü ben taşıyorum."
"Bu durumu açıklamak zorunda kalmaktan dolayı kendimi suçlu hissediyorum, çünkü bu konuda yalan söylediğimi düşünüyor olabilir, ancak gerçekte bununla yüzleşen ve yaşayan benim."
"Açıkçası, bu konuyu kendi lehine manipüle ettiğimi düşünerek beni suçlu hissettiriyor, ancak gerçekte bunun ağır sonuçlarını ben yaşıyorum."
"Sanki kendi çıkarım için bir hikaye uydurmuş gibi düşünerek beni suçlu hissettiriyor, ancak gerçekte bu durumla mücadele eden ve sonuçlarına katlanan benim."
Kendimi çok uykulu hissediyorum ve son zamanlarda daha kötü beyin sisi yaşadım.
Yorgunluktan bezdim ve son zamanlarda odaklanmakta çok zorlanıyorum.
Uykum çok geliyor ve beynim sanki dumanlı bir sisin içindeymiş gibi hissediyorum.
Enerjim tamamen bitti ve düşüncelerim bulanıklaşıyor.
Uykuya çok ihtiyacım var ve beynim sanki çalışmıyor gibi.
Kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum ve son zamanlarda konsantre olmakta zorlanıyorum.
İş toplantıları sırasında konuşurken zaman zaman kendimi tamamen aptal hissediyorum. Ayrıntılara da kolayca odaklanamıyorum ya da tutamıyorum. Hem geveze bir aptal hem de insanlardan kendilerini tekrar etmelerini ya da talimatları tekrar etmelerini isteyen bir sıkıntı hissediyorum.
"Toplantılarda kendimi sık sık beceriksiz ve kaybolmuş hissediyorum, düşüncelerimi ifade etmekte zorlanıyorum ve konuyu takip edemiyorum."
"Konuşurken düşüncelerim birbirine giriyor, söylemek istediklerimi tam olarak ifade edemiyorum ve aptalca sözler söylüyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"İş toplantılarında düşüncelerim havada uçuşuyor, kendimi ifade edemiyorum ve aynı soruları tekrar tekrar soruyorum."
"Zaman zaman kendimi toplu bir ortamda konuşurken beceriksiz ve gereksiz hissediyorum, aklımı toplayamıyorum ve sürekli aynı şeyleri tekrarlıyorum."
"Kendimi toplantılarda sürekli boş konuştuğumu ve dikkatin dağıldığını hissediyorum, düşüncelerimi organize edemiyorum ve istediğim gibi iletişim kuramiyorum."
Yaklaşık 3-4 yıl boyunca gereksiz yere üzerindeydim ve bunun benim için bir ilaç olmadığını fark ettim çünkü PMDD'm için bir bok yapmadı.
Uzun süre boyunca bu işe takıldım ama sonunda işe yaramadığını anladım.
Yıllarca bunu denemeye devam ettim ama faydasını görmedim.
Gerçekten işe yarayacağını düşünerek bu yolu denedim ama sonuçta hiçbir işe yaramadı.
Bu konuya çok fazla zaman harcadım ama sonunda bana bir faydası olmadığını fark ettim.
Bu durum için bir çözüm aradığımı sandım ama sonunda bu durumun bana hiçbir şey kazandırmadığını fark ettim.
"Erkek arkadaşımın, luteal fazımda olduğum zaman hayatımı daha da kötüleştirdiğini biliyormuş gibi hissediyorum... Yüzümün değiştiğini ve glutum gibi göründüğümü söylüyor... Kendimi huzursuz hissediyorum... Bir ilişkide insan olmayı özlüyorum... sadece huysuz ve anlayışlı olmak."
"Erkek arkadaşımın, sanki luteal fazımda olduğum zaman daha da hassas olduğumu biliyormuş gibi davranıyor... Sanki hiçbir şey yapamıyormuşum gibi..."
Sanki luteal fazımda olduğum zaman her şey bana batıyormuş gibi hissediyorum... Küçük şeylerde bile sinirleniyorum...
"Erkek arkadaşımın, luteal fazımda olduğum zaman daha da fazla duygusal olduğumu bildiğini hissediyorum... Bir çocuğa davranıyormuş gibi davranıyor..."
Sanki luteal fazımda olduğum zaman tüm dengemi kaybediyormuş gibi hissediyorum... Her şeyin üstüne gidiyorum...
Luteal fazımda olduğum zaman hayatımın nasıl bir kabusa dönüştüğünü erkek arkadaşımın anladığını hissediyorum... Sanki bu dönemde benimle nasıl davranacağını bilemiyor...
"Dün gece kesinlikle korkunç bir şekilde uyudum. 8:30 civarında yatağa girdim ve tüm gece boyunca fırlatıp çeviriyordum. Özellikle tam üflemeli sıcak basmalar yapmıyordum, ancak serin hissetmek için her zaman bir bacağımı sokacaktım, fanın bana doğru üfleme hissi beni çıldırttı. Ama çok sıcaksam uyuyamıyorum."
"Dün gece uyuyamıyordum, sanki vücudumun içinde bir ateş varmış gibi hissediyordum."
Sıcak basmaları o kadar kötüydü ki gece boyunca yatağımda fırlanıp durdum.
Uyumalıyım ama vücudum sanki yanıyormuş gibi hissediyordu.
Bir türlü uyuyamıyordum ve uykuya dalmaya çalıştıkça daha da sıcak oluyordum.
"Gece boyunca uyanık kaldım, çünkü sürekli olarak vücudumun aşırı sıcak olduğunu hissediyordum."
"Bu sabah partnerimle olan soğukkanlılığımı tamamen kaybettim... ve sonra kardeşimden beni yakalamasını istedim, böylece biraz yer bulabildim. Bir durum için hangi duygu ve duyguların geçerli olduğuna dair ipucu verebilecek gibi hissetmeden her ay bu şekilde kontrolden çıkmaktan yoruldum?... Çoğu gün ne kadar ileri geldiğimizle gurur duyuyorum, ancak böyle günlerde tüm düşünebildiğim, 29 yaşında kendimi düzenleyemeyeceğim ve kendimi düzenleyemeyeceğim bir başarısızlığın ne kadar büyük bir başarısızlık olduğu."
"Bugün yine kontrolden çıktım ve kendimi bir kez daha çaresiz hissettim, sanki tüm çabalarım boşunaymış gibi."
"Sabahları kendimde olan kontrolün akşamları tamamen kaybolması beni çıldırtıyor, sanki kendimi yeniden keşfediyormuşum gibi."
"Partnerimle olan tartışma yine bir patlamaya dönüştü, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, sanki bir çocuk gibi davranıyorum."
"Duyguların beni ele geçirmesiyle kendimi kaybetmekten ve etrafımdaki insanlara zarar vermekten korkuyorum, bu kontrolsüzlük beni ürkütüyor."
"29 yaşında kendimi kontrol edememek, bir yetişkin gibi davranamamak beni hayattan soğutuyor, her gün aynı döngüde sıkışıp kaldığımı hissediyorum."
"Ben pmdd vardı, o tedavi için bana yaz yazdı ve ben jenerik başlayacak. Ben çok sabırsızım ve bunun benim için hemen çalışmaya başlamasını istiyorum çünkü ben çok bittim."
Benim için biraz zaman alacağını biliyorum ama bu ilaçlar hemen etki etmeye başlasın istiyorum.
Bu ilaçların işe yaramasını gerçekten çok istiyorum.
Uzun zamandır kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum ve bu ilaçların beni eski haline getirmesini umuyorum.
Umarım bu ilaçlar beni hızlıca rahatlatır.
Bu ilaçlar sayesinde artık kendimi daha iyi hissedeceğimi düşünüyorum.
Kötü günlerde kendimi balkondan atmamanın ne kadar güç gerektirdiğini insanlara anlatmaya bile başlayamıyorum... Bundan nasıl kurtulacağımı bilmiyorum... Bu duyguların bir gün kazanmasını istemiyorum.
"Kendimi kaybetmekten, her şeyden vazgeçmekten korkuyorum. Güçlüyüm ama bazen gerçekten çok zor."
Böyle hissetmemem gerektiğini biliyorum ama her şey çok karanlık görünüyor.
Her şeyin bir sonu olduğunu düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum.
Hayatın bana neden bu kadar acımasız davrandığını anlamıyorum.
Umarım bir gün bu duyguların üstesinden gelebilirim.
"Bir sahtekar gibi hissediyorum - özellikle dönemimden önce duygularımdan ve düşüncelerimden şüphe ediyorum... Gecikmiş ve düzensiz dönemler geçirdim... Ruh hali değişimleri zihinsel olarak dayanılmazdır, özellikle de aylardır geçirdiğim dönemlerden önce... Onunla birlikte gelen beyin sisinden nefret ediyorum. Üretken değilim ve profesyonel değilim."
"Duygularımla ve düşüncelerimle tamamen kopuk hissediyorum, adeta kendi bedenimde yabancılaşmış gibi."
"Bu bedensel değişimleri kontrol edememe beni sinirlendiriyor, her şeyin üzerinde bir kontrol kaybı hissediyorum."
"Beyin sisinden dolayı odaklanamıyorum, en basit işler bile bir dağ gibi geliyor."
"Duygusal dalgalanmalar beni tüketiyor, kendimde bile huzur bulamıyorum."
"Bu süreçte kendime yabancılaşıyorum, kim olduğumu ve ne istediğimi bilmiyorum."
Korkutmadım ya da herhangi bir erime yaşamadım. Hala BDD'm var ama ayın diğer zamanlarından daha kötü değil.
"luteal fazımdayken, karanlık ve rahatsız edici herhangi bir şeyi izlemeyi severim, bir nevi stres idk'imi serbest bırakır."
Tekrarlar çünkü ne olacağını bildiğim için bana endişe vermezler.
Tekrarlardan korkmuyorum çünkü ne olacağını biliyorum.
Bildiğim şeyleri tekrarlamak beni rahatsız etmiyor.
"Aynı şeyleri tekrarlamak beni endişelendirmiyor, sonuçları zaten biliyorum."
"Tekrarlar bana aşinalık hissi veriyor, çünkü ne olacağını biliyorum."
"Ne olacağını bildiğim şeyler tekrarlansa bile, beni tedirgin etmiyor."
PMDD'li bir kadın ve şiddetli panik atak geçiren bir meslektaşıyla karşılaşması. Her ikisi de rahatsızlıklarının bir sonucu olarak iş bulmak ve işlerini sürdürmek için mücadele ediyor.
"PMDD'li bir kadın ve şiddetli panik atak geçiren bir meslektaşı, günlük işlerini yürütmekte ve sağlıklı ilişkiler kurmakta zorlanıyor."
"Her iki kadın da rahatsızlıkları nedeniyle iş başvurularında zorlanıyor, bu da onların ekonomik ve sosyal hayattaki bağımsızlıklarını tehdit ediyor."
"Bu kadınların, günlük işlerini yürütebilmek için düzenli tıbbi desteğe ve anlayışlı bir çalışma ortamına ihtiyacı var."
"Hem PMDD hem de şiddetli panik atak, kadınların yaşamlarında önemli zorluklara yol açan ve onların potansiyellerini tam olarak gerçekleştirmelerini engelleyen ruhsal sağlık sorunlarıdır."
"Bu kadınlar, karşılaştıkları zorluklar nedeniyle toplumsal dışlanma ve ayrımcılıkla karşı karşıya kalabilir, bu da onların ruhsal sağlığını daha da kötüleştirebilir."
Tolerans gösteremem.
Bu durumu artık kaldıramam.
"Bununla uzlaşamam, kabul edemem."
"Sınırlarım aşıldı, daha fazla dayanamam."
"Bu durum beni çok rahatsız ediyor, devam edemem."
"Artık yeter, susmak istemiyorum."

Beni derinden yaraladı ve uzun süre ağladım.

Kendimi spiral gibi hissediyorum.
Her şeyin bir döngü içinde olduğunu hissediyorum.
Sonu olmayan bir döngünün içinde sıkışıp kaldığımı hissediyorum.
Duygularım beni bir uçurumun kenarına doğru çekiyor.
Sıkıntılı ve çaresiz bir döngüye girmiş gibiyim.
Bir yere varamadan aynı yerde dönüp duruyorum.
"Ben lutealdeydim... Beni aradı ve ne yaptığımı sordu. ""Rom-com'u izliyorum"" dedim ve ""Yani adetin yakında mı?"" diye sordu."

Dönemimden önceki son birkaç gün aşırı derecede olumsuzum, paranoyağım ve sürekli onunla kavga ediyorum. Yüksek endişem, korkunç kabuslarım, kötü bir şey hakkında hüküm süren düşüncelerim ve intihar düşüncesim var. Gerçekten inanıyorum ki ailemin dışında daha iyi göremeyeceğim ve daha iyi göremeyeceğim."
"Onunla birlikte geçirdiğim her an beni strese sokuyor. Davranışları, konuşmaları, her şeyi sinir bozucu buluyorum."
"Onunla sürekli tartışmaktan ve negatif düşüncelerden yorulduğum için, ondan uzaklaşmaya ihtiyacım var."
"Bu dönemde yaşadığım olumsuz duygular, yüksek endişe, paranoya ve intihar düşünceleriyle baş edemiyorum."
"Onun yanında olmanın benim için hiçbir faydası yok, aksine ruh halimi daha da kötüleştiriyor."
"Onun davranışları ve sürekli çatışmalar nedeniyle, kendimi ailem dışında daha iyi hissedebileceğime inanıyorum."
"sizi tamamen başka problemler dalgasına neden olacak ilaçlara koymak istiyorlar. Hormonal sorunlar, depresyon, baş ağrısı, kilo alımı, uykusuzluk vb."
"Sizi, bir sürü yeni problemle yüzleşmenize sebep olacak ilaçlarla doldurmak istiyorlar. Kilo alımı, yorgunluk, endişe, sinirlilik, uyku sorunları ve daha niceleri."
"Sizi, bir sürü yan etkisi olan ilaçlarla dolu bir hayat yaşamaya zorluyorlar. Bağırsak problemleri, cilt sorunları, saç dökülmesi, cinsel isteksizlik, bağışıklık sisteminin zayıflaması gibi."
"Sizi, bir sürü sağlık sorununu tetikleyebilecek ilaçlara mahkum etmek istiyorlar. Yüksek tansiyon, kalp hastalığı, böbrek yetmezliği, kanser riski, alerjik reaksiyonlar gibi."
"Sizi, hayatınızı alt üst edebilecek ilaçların pençesine düşürmek istiyorlar.  Enerji kaybı, konsantrasyon güçlüğü, hafıza sorunları, motivasyon eksikliği, dikkat dağınıklığı gibi."
"Sizi, bir sürü yeni ilaçla dolu bir hayatın içine çekmek istiyorlar.  Eklem ağrıları, kas krampları, baş dönmesi, mide bulantısı, göz bulanıklığı gibi."
Bütün hafta iş yerinde maske takıyordum. Sadece bir topa kıvrılıp ağlamak istiyorum.
"Bu hafta çok zor geçti, sadece evde kalıp dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Her gün aynı şeyleri yapmak beni gerçekten yordu, biraz eğlenceye ihtiyacım var."
"İşim beni çok stres ediyor, biraz rahatlamaya ihtiyacım var."
"Bu hafta çok yoğun çalıştım, biraz zaman ayırıp kendime bakmak istiyorum."
"Bütün gün aynı şeyleri yapmak beni gerçekten bunalttı, biraz da kendimle ilgilenmek istiyorum."
Dosyamda PMS'den muzdarip olduğum yazıyor ama PMDD'yi tartıştığımızı hatırlıyorum.

Dosyamda PMS'den muzdarip olduğum yazıyor ama ben aslında PMDD'nin daha ciddi bir durumu olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Nasıl sosyalleşeceğimi bilmiyorum ya da insanların beni sevmediğini ya da beni yeterince ilginç bulmadığını hissediyorum, belki garip şeyleri seviyorum ya da daha az ortak ilgim var, bilmiyorum. Hala arkadaş istiyorum, bu deneyimlerin beni şekillendirmesine izin vermemeye çalışıyorum. Yarın döngümün ilk günü, bu yüzden neden bu yoğun üzüntüyü hissettiğimi biliyorum, sadece bununla baş etmek berbat."
"Sosyalleşmek konusunda kendimi yetersiz hissediyorum, insanlar bana ne kadar sıcak davranacaklarından emin değilim, bu yüzden kendimi geri çekiyorum."
Duygusal olarak çöküşte olduğumu hissediyorum ve bunun ne kadar süreceğini bilmiyorum. Belki ben de yeterince iyi değilimdir?
"Özgün olmak, dışlanmış olmakla aynı şey mi? Bu konuda pek emin değilim, ama kendimi yalnız hissediyorum."
"Duygusal yükselme ve düşüşler yaşamak zorunda kalmaktan yorulduğum anlar oluyor, arkadaşlık ve bağlantı ihtiyacı her şeyden güçlü geliyor."
"Her gün aynı kaygıları yaşıyorum, kendimle ilgili endişeler, insanlarla bağlantı kuramamak, dışlanmış hissetmek. Ne kadar sürecek bilmiyorum."
Adet dönemimden 10 gün kadar önce tüm ekstra kötü psikolojik semptomlara sahip olacaktım ve adet dönemime başladığım anda hemen duracaklardı... Kendime/başkalarına zarar vermek istemiyorum. Kendimi tekrar kontrol altında hissediyorum.
"Adet dönemim öncesinde çok kötü ruh halleri yaşıyordum, ama adet başladıktan sonra hemen geçiyordu... Kendime ya da başkalarına zarar vermek istemiyorum, kendimi tekrar kontrol altında hissediyorum."
"Her ay aynı şey oluyordu: Adet dönemimden önceki 10 gün boyunca inanılmaz bir ruhsal iniş çıkış yaşıyordum, ama adet başladıktan sonra her şey normale dönüyordu... Kendime ya da başkalarına zarar vermekten korkuyorum, kendimi tekrar sakin hissediyorum."
"Adet döneminden önceki günlerde o kadar kötü hissediyordum ki, kendimi kontrol edemiyordum... Ama adet başladıktan sonra hemen normale dönüyordum. Kendimi tekrar iyi hissediyorum, kendime ve başkalarına zarar vermekten korkmuyorum."
"Adet dönemimden önceki günler her zaman zor geçiyordu, çok agresif ve kontrolsüz hissediyordum... Ama adet başladıktan sonra her şey normale dönüyordu... Kendime zarar vermekten korkuyorum, kendimi tekrar iyi hissediyorum."
"Adet dönemimden önceki günler çok kötü geçiyordu, kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum ve sürekli sinirliydim... Ama adet başladıktan sonra her şey normale dönüyordu... Kendimi ve başkalarını güvende hissediyorum, kendimi kontrol altında hissediyorum."
PMS semptomlarının kötüleştiğini ve ruh halimin daha da zorlaştığını fark ettim.
"Bu ayki PMS semptomları çok ağır geçiyor, sanki her şey daha da kötüleşmiş gibi."
"Her zamankinden daha fazla sinirliyim, PMS'in etkisi iyice arttı galiba."
"Son zamanlarda enerjim çok düşük ve sürekli sinirliyim, PMS'den dolayı bu şekilde hissettiğimi düşünüyorum."
"Ruh halimdeki dalgalanmalar dayanılmaz hale geldi, PMS semptomları çok kötü."
"Sanki tüm bedenimde bir ağırlık var ve çok mutsuz hissediyorum, PMS'in bu şekilde etkilediğini düşünüyorum."
"Tamamen bitkin durumdayım ve etrafımdaki hiç kimse gerçekten görmüyor ya da anlamıyormuş gibi hissediyorum... Sadece bu duvarı hayatıma çöktürdüm... her ay gibi hissediyorum, sadece kelimenin tam anlamıyla grip gibi hissettiğim bir haftam var ve kramplarla ve baş ağrılarıyla mücadele ediyorum ve sadece açıkça sefil."
Benimle olan her şeyin üzerine sadece bu büyük bir gölge gibi çöküyor ve hiçbir şey değiştirmiyor...
Bu kadar çok şeyden yoruluyorum ki sonunda sadece bu uçurumun kenarında duruyorum ve her şeyden kopmak istiyorum.
"İşte yine bir başka hafta daha, sürekli olarak bu döngüye takılıp kalıyorum ve sonunda hiçbir şey değişiyor gibi görünmüyor."
"Anlamalarını istiyorum, ama hissettiğim şeyin ne kadar gerçek olduğunu anladıklarından emin değilim..."
Çoğu zaman sadece kendi başıma olduğunu ve hiç kimse gerçekten neyle uğraştığımı bilmediğini hissediyorum.
"Başım dönüyor, midem bulanıyor ve hatta ateşim var (çok sıcak ve sersemlemiş hissediyorum)."
"Çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki hastalanmak üzereyim."
"Bu grip sanırım, çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Bugün kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum, midem bulanıyor ve başım dönüyor."
"Ateşim var ve çok halsizim, yataktan kalkamıyorum."
"Başım dönüyor, midem bulanıyor ve hiçbir şey yiyemiyorum."
İyi olacağımı düşünüyorum ama sonra düşünceler durmadığında kendimi kafama vurmaya çalışırken buluyorum. Gerçekten yüzümü koparmak ve sürekli çığlık atmak istiyorum. Sadece tam bir orospuyum ve köpeklerime çığlık atıyorum... Aslında kendimi deli hissediyorum.
"Kendimi gerçekten kötü hissediyorum, ama sonra bu duyguların gitmesini sağlayamıyorum, sadece orada oturup kendimi hissetmeme izin veriyorum."
"Sanki içimde bir şey patlayacakmış gibi hissediyorum, nefes alamıyorum, kendimi tutamıyorum."
"Hepimizin kötü günler yaşadığı doğru, ancak bugün benim için her şeyden daha kötü. Gerçekten çökmek üzereyim."
"Hayat bana çok ağır geliyor, sürekli bir mücadele gibi hissediyorum. Sadece bu duyguyu üzerimden atmak istiyorum."
"Duygusal olarak tükenmiş hissediyorum. Kendimi toparlayamıyorum, sanki içimde bir boşluk varmış gibi."
Kendimi çok suçluyorum ve bir yıldan fazla bir süredir hala çok üzülüyorum. Onu çok özlüyorum ve keşke burada çok kötü olsaydı. 22 yaşındayım ama bu dünyada annesi ona rehberlik etmeden kaybolmuş küçük bir kız gibi hissediyorum. Ona hala burada ihtiyacım vardı.
Acı kaybın ağır yükünü taşıyorum ve bu duyguların bende bıraktığı derin yaralar hala taze.
Ona olan özlemim her geçen gün daha da artıyor. Onun yokluğunun boşluğunu hiçbir şey dolduramıyor.
"Hayatımda kocaman bir boşluk var ve kimse onu dolduramaz. O, benim için her şeydi."
Onunla olan anılarımdan beslenmeye çalışıyorum ama bu bile acımı dindiremiyor.
Hayatımda bana rehberlik eden ve yol gösteren birisi daha yok ve bu his beni korkutuyor.
"Adetimden hemen önce inanılmaz derecede güvensiz hissettim... Endişelendim ve yapmamaya çalışsam da konuyu açtım... Henüz söylemedim çünkü utanıyorum ve bahaneler uyduruyormuş gibi görünmek istemiyorum... Şimdi bok gibi hissediyorum, sadece içselleştirmem gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"Adet dönemim gelmeden önce kendimi inanılmaz derecede çaresiz hissettim, sanki hayatın kontrolünü kaybetmişim gibi."
"Her ay aynı şey oluyor, adetimden önce tüm güvenim yerle bir oluyor, kendime bile güvenemiyorum."
"Bu hisler beni tamamen ele geçiriyor, adetimden önce bu kadar kötü hissetmemeliyim ama bir türlü durduramıyorum."
"Bilmiyorum neden bu kadar kötü hissediyorum, sanki tüm dünya bana karşıymış gibi... Adetimden önce her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Kendimi bir türlü toparlayamıyorum, bu hisler beni mahvediyor... Adetimden önce hissettiğim bu güvensizlik beni tamamen yiyip bitiriyor."
Sadece havalandırmaya ihtiyacım vardı. Aklımı kaybediyorum....Boundaries'imde derin bir şekilde hata yapıyorum. Yardım.
"Gerçekten kendimi kötü hissediyorum, sadece biraz taze hava almak istiyorum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, sınırlarımı tamamen aştım."
"Yardıma ihtiyacım var, aklımı kaybediyorum."
"Bu kadar stresli olmamın bir nedeni olmalı, kendime gelmem gerek."
"Bilmiyorum ne yapacağımı, kendime zarar veriyorum."
"astımım, döküntülerim (dermatografi noktasına kadar), zihinsel düşüş ve PMDD sırasındaki diğer semptomlarım"
"Sağlık sorunlarımla mücadele ediyorum, astım, döküntüler, zihinsel düşüş ve PMDD nedeniyle oluşan diğer semptomlar var."
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak zorlu zamanlardan geçiyorum, astım, deri döküntüleri, zihinsel düşüş ve PMDD semptomlarıyla uğraşıyorum."
"Astım, deri döküntüleri ve PMDD'nin yanı sıra, zihinsel düşüş gibi diğer belirtilerle mücadele ediyorum, bu da günlük yaşantımı etkiliyor."
"Bu semptomları deneyimlemek benim için oldukça zorlu, astım, deri döküntüleri, zihinsel düşüş ve PMDD'nin her biri farklı zorluklar getiriyor."
"Astım, deri döküntüleri, zihinsel düşüş ve PMDD gibi bir dizi sağlık sorunumla uğraşıyorum, her biri günlük yaşantımı farklı şekillerde etkiliyor."
"Hepimiz üretken yaşamımızın 1/4'ünü (veya daha fazlasını) alan bir şeyle acı çekiyoruz. Ve hepimiz kapitalist toplumlarda yaşıyoruz, bu da her şeyin üstünde muazzam bir finansal baskı yaratıyor. Çoğumuz muhtemelen bir çözüm için umutsuzuz."
Hepimizin ortak bir sorunumuz var: zamanımızın büyük bir bölümünü (belki de yarısından fazlasını) işlerimizi tamamlamak için harcıyoruz.
Modern yaşamın getirdiği baskılar altında eziliyoruz ve işlerimizin bize getirdiği maddi yükün altından kalkmaya çalışıyoruz.
Çoğumuz bu sürekli bir yarış halinde yaşıyoruz ve bu yarışın sonunda kazanma ihtimalimiz oldukça düşük.
Toplumun beklentileri ve bireysel ihtiyaçlar arasında kalan bir çatışma içinde yaşıyoruz.
Günlük yaşamın getirdiği sıkıntılarla boğuşuyoruz ve hayatımızı kolaylaştıracak çözümler bulmak için çabalıyoruz.
Muhtemelen burada hayatımı kurtardım.
Bu olayda hayatımı kurtardım diyebilirim.
Gerçekten burada hayatımı kurtardığım için minnettarım.
Bu durumdan sağ salim çıkabilmem harika bir duygu.
"Muhtemelen burada hayatım kurtuldu, şanslıyım."
"Burada hayatımı kurtardığım kesin, başka türlü sonuçlanabilirdi."
"Antihistaminikleri bu denizaltıda paylaşılan kişisel öykülerden öğrendim. Sonra doktorumla konuştum ve şimdi onları alıyorum * doktorumun onayı ve rehberliğiyle*. Şimdiye kadar başka hiçbir şeyin olmadığı bir şekilde çalışıyor. Öte yandan, Prozac beynimi kırdı. PMDD için onaylandı, ancak tepkim korkunçtu."
"Bu denizaltı içinde paylaşılan kişisel öykülerden öğrendiğim alternatif bir çözüm yolu mevcutmuş, kendi kendime bunu denemeye karar verdim, ancak doktoruma da danıştım, o da bana bu konuda destek verdi."
"Bazı kişilerin Prozac'ı etkili bulduğunu duydum, ancak benim deneyimim çok farklıydı, beynimde garip bir his yarattı."
"Önceden başka hiçbir şeyin işe yaramadığı bir konuda, bu denediğim yeni yöntem harika çalışıyor."
"Bu deneyim bana, tıbbi tedavi seçeneklerinin kişiden kişiye değişebileceğini ve bir tedavi için iyi bir sonuç alan biri için bile diğerleri için işe yaramayabileceğini gösterdi."
"Doktorumla açık ve dürüst bir şekilde iletişim kurmamın önemi konusunda daha çok farkındayım, çünkü bu sayede doğru tedaviye ulaşabilir ve ihtiyacım olan desteği alabilirim."
Allegra'yı kullanarak ikinci döngümü tamamladım ve semptomlarımı yine %75 azalttı.
"Allegra'nın etkisiyle ikinci seferdir bu alerji ataklarından kurtuldum, yine de %75 oranında azalmış olmasına rağmen."
"İkinci kez Allegra'yı denedim ve yine aynı etkiyi gördüm, semptomlarım %75 oranında azaldı."
"Allegra sayesinde ikinci kere alerjik reaksiyonumu kontrol altına aldım, semptomlar %75 oranında azalsa da yine de rahatsız edici."
"İkinci denememde de Allegra beklediğim gibi %75 oranında semptomlarımı azalttı, bu ilaç gerçekten işe yarıyor."
"Allegra'nın faydasını ikinci kez gördüm, %75 oranında semptomlarım azaldı ama hala hafif bir rahatsızlık hissediyorum."
Kötü niyetli bir ilişkideyken anksiyete için alıyordum. Zaman geçtikçe çalışması için giderek daha fazla almak zorunda kaldım. İstemeden aşırı dozlamayla sonuçlandı.
"Kötü bir ilişkinin içindeyken anksiyete için ilaç alıyordum, ama zaman geçtikçe etkisi azalıyordu ve giderek daha fazla doz almak zorunda kalıyordum."
"İlişki beni çok üzüyor ve stresliyordu, bu yüzden anksiyete için ilaç almaya başladım. Ama zamanla ilaçlar işe yaramaz oldu ve daha fazla doz almak zorunda kaldım."
Kötü bir ilişkinin içindeyken kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum ve anksiyete ilaçlarına başvurdum. Ancak zaman geçtikçe ilaçlar işe yaramaz hale geldi ve daha fazla doz almak zorunda kaldım.
"Anksiyete ilaçları başlangıçta kötü ilişkiyle başa çıkmama yardımcı oluyordu, ama zamanla işe yaramaz hale geldi ve aşırı doz almaya başladım."
İlişkideki sorunlar beni çok bunaltıyordu ve anksiyete ilaçları almaya başladım. Ancak ilaçlar zamanla etkisini kaybetti ve daha fazla doz almak zorunda kaldım.
"Yol öfkemi dağıtmama yardımcı olan küçük bir oyunu paylaşmak istedim... Cehennem haftası boyunca, bu şeyler sizi kendi arabanızı kasten çevirmeye hazır hale getirebilir."
"Yol öfkesi ile başa çıkmak için küçük bir hile keşfettim, belki sizin için de işe yarar."
"Yol öfkesi herkesin yaşadığı bir şey, bu hafta özellikle zor geçti."
"Bu hafta trafikte gerçekten sinirlendim, kendimi arabanın direksiyonuna vurmaktan zor kurtardım."
"Yol öfkesi ile başa çıkmak gerçekten zor, özellikle de bu gibi yoğun haftalarda."
"Bu hafta trafikte çok sinirlendim, kendimi sakinleştirmek için ufak tefek şeylere tutunmaya çalıştım."
"Akışım her zamankinden daha ağırmış gibi hissediyorum... Bütün gün yataktaydım, ağlıyordum ve çok zayıf hissediyordum."
"Bugün kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki bütün enerjim çekilip alınmış gibi."
"Sanki bir ağırlık üzerime binmiş gibi, hiç hareket edemiyorum."
"Çok yorgunum, vücudumda hiç güç kalmamış gibi hissediyorum."
"Kendimi çok çaresiz ve yalnız hissediyorum, sanki tüm dünyanın yükü omuzlarımda gibi."
"Bugün kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki içimde bir boşluk varmış gibi."
Ayda bir kez saat gibi ciddi bir PMDD deseni olduğunu fark etmeye başladım... Geçmişte (ve şimdi) kaygı ve depresyondan adil payımı aldım... Kronik olarak mutsuz olmaktan çok yoruldum.
"Son birkaç ayda her ay aynı zamanlarda yoğun ruh hali değişimleri yaşadığımı fark ettim, sanki bir saat gibi düzenli geliyor."
"Adet döngümün belirli günlerinde yoğun ruh hali dalgalanmaları yaşıyorum, geçmişte de sık sık kaygı ve depresyonla mücadele etmiştim."
"Bu ayda bir kez yaşadığım ruh hali değişimleri beni gerçekten yoruyor, kaygı ve depresyonun hayatımı olumsuz etkilediğini hissediyorum."
"Adet döngümdeki bu belirgin PMDD belirtileri, sanki bir alarm saati gibi düzenli olarak ortaya çıkıyor ve beni gerçekten yordu."
"Her ay aynı dönemde bu yoğun ruh hali değişimlerini yaşamak çok yıpratıcı, sanki bir saat gibi düzenli ve tahmin edilebilir bir şekilde geliyor."
"Soğuk algınlığı/grip, mide bulantısı, zayıf ve yorgun bir dönemde burnuna aldığın o hastalıklı duyguyu ürpertiler ve sıcak basmalar alıyorum... SÜPER duygusallaşıyorum, karanlık düşüncelere sahibim, ağır kanamam var, korkunç acılardan ağlayarak banyo zemininde yatıyorum ve belki de bu dönem grip."
"Grip belirtilerini hissediyorum - baş ağrısı, yorgunluk, genel bir halsizlik, sanki vücudumda bir savaş yaşanıyormuş gibi... Her şey çok ağır ve karanlık geliyor, adeta bir sis içindeyim."
"Sıcaklık değişimleri, titremeler, terlemeler... Bu grip mi, yoksa başka bir şey mi bilmiyorum ama vücudumun bana sinyal gönderdiği çok açık."
"Boynum ağrıyor, eklemlerim sızlıyor, başım dönüyor... Grip gibi hissediyorum ama emin olamıyorum. Tüm enerjimi kaybetmiş gibiyim, sanki bir duvarın içine hapsolmuşum."
"Bu grip olmalı, çünkü kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Başım çok ağrıyor, vücudum kırık gibi, iştahım yok, sadece yatağa uzanıp uyumak istiyorum."
"Grip gibiyim, ancak bu sefer daha farklı. Daha kötü, daha yoğun. Bu zayıflık, bu halsizlik, sanki her şeyi bırakmak istiyorum."
"Hipersomni, sinirlilik, intihar düşünceleri, akne vb. deneyimliyordum, ancak bu ay uykusuzluk, iştahsızlık, iştahsızlık, gece terlemeleri ve kramplar yaşadım."
"Son zamanlarda hep yorgun ve sinirliydim, intihar düşünceleri bile geliyordu aklıma, sivilce de çıkıyordu sürekli. Ama bu ay bambaşka bir haldeydim. Uyuyamıyordum, iştahım kesilmişti, gece terlemiyordum ve kasılmalar yaşıyordum."
"Önceden aşırı uyku hali, sinirlilik, intihar düşünceleri, sivilce gibi sorunlar yaşıyordum ama bu ay tamamen farklı semptomlar ortaya çıktı. Uykusuzluk, iştahsızlık, gece terlemesi ve kasılmalar yaşadım."
"Sürekli yorgunluk, sinirlilik, intihar düşünceleri, sivilce derken, bu ay uykusuzluk, iştahsızlık, gece terlemesi ve kramplar başladı. Vücudum sanki benimle savaş halinde."
"Geçtiğimiz günlerde aşırı uyku hali, sinirlilik, intihar düşünceleri, sivilce gibi sorunlar yaşıyordum fakat bu ay tamamen farklı bir durumla karşı karşıyayım. Uyuyamıyorum, iştahım kesildi, gece terlemesi ve kasılmalar yaşıyorum."
"Önceki dönemde hipersomni, sinirlilik, intihar düşünceleri, akne gibi sorunlar yaşamıştım ancak bu ay uykusuzluk, iştahsızlık, gece terlemesi ve kramplar gibi farklı bir semptom yelpazesi ile karşı karşıyayım."
"Normalde 10. günden başlayarak adet dönemime kadar ölüm gibi hissediyorum. Ayrıca diğer her dönem bir öncekinden biraz daha az şiddetlidir, ki bu hoştur, ama hiç böyle bir MILF'im olmadı."
Adet döneminden önceki günlerde kendimi bitkin ve yorgun hissediyorum.
Her ay adet dönemim yaklaştıkça kendimi daha yorgun ve güçsüz hissediyorum.
"Bu ay adet dönemi öncesi hissettiğim yorgunluk, normalden daha yoğun."
"Geçen dönemlerden daha kötü hissediyorum, her ay daha da kötüleşiyor."
Adet döneminden önceki günlerde kendimi kötü hissetmem çok rahatsız edici.
menstruasyonların sona ermesinden sonra bile depresyonda
Menopozdan sonra bile hala mutsuz hissediyorum.
Hayatımın bu döneminde bile hala mutsuz hissediyorum.
Artık adet görmesem de hala depresyondayım.
Fiziksel değişiklikler sona erse bile hala duygusal olarak mücadele ediyorum.
Her şey bittiğinde bile hala bu boşluk hissiyle boğuşuyorum.
Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hissedebiliyordum. Son 7 gün çok şiştim *. HELL oldu. Bugün işe yürüyordum ve kıyafetlerim tamamen rahatsızdı. Şimdi aynı kıyafet beni asıyormuş gibi geliyor. Birkaç saat içinde tüm vücudum değişti.
"Kendimi bir balon gibi hissediyorum, adeta şişmişim. Son 7 gün içinde o kadar kilo aldım ki kıyafetlerim artık dar geliyor."
"Sanki bir haftada 5 kilo almışım gibi hissediyorum. Her şey dar geliyor, kıyafetlerim bile."
"Kendimi hiç tanıyamadım. Geçen hafta çok yemek yedim sanırım, bugün kıyafetlerimin içine sığamadım."
Bir hafta önce giyebildiğim pantolon bugün bacaklarıma sıkıştı. Sanki bir gecede şişmişim gibi.
"Kendimi çok şişman hissediyorum, adeta başka bir beden olmuşum gibi. Kıyafetlerimin hepsi dar, hareket bile edemiyorum."
"Adet dönemimdeyken ve ondan hemen önce ciddi bir şekilde çizemediğimi, beynim ve ellerim arasındaki bağlantının kapalı olduğu ve istediğimi yapmalarını sağlayamadığım gibi buluyorum."
"Adet dönemimde, bedenimde hissettiğim değişimler yaratıcılığımı da etkiliyor, sanki beyin ve ellerim arasındaki bağlantı kopmuş gibi."
"Her ay bu dönemde, kendimi yaratıcı olarak bloke olmuş hissediyorum, beyin ile ellerim arasındaki iletişim sanki kesiliyor."
"Adet dönemimde, düşüncelerimi kağıda dökmekte zorlanıyorum, sanki bir engel varmış gibi, beynim ve ellerim birbirlerini anlayamıyor."
"Dönemin başlangıcından önce ve sırasında, yaratıcılığımı kaybettiğimi hissediyorum, sanki beyin ve ellerim ayrı çalışıyormuş gibi."
"Adet dönemimde, kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum, çünkü yaratıcı düşüncelerimi hayata geçiremiyorum, sanki beynim ve ellerim birbirlerine yabancılaşmış gibi."
"Çöp gibi hissediyorum, bugün 11. gün. Adetimi alana kadar 11. gün benim için sadece sefil."
"Bugün her şey çok ağır geliyor, sanki dünyanın tüm yükü üzerimde gibi."
"Her şeyin üstüme üstüme geldiği günlerden birindeyim, adetimi alana kadar kendimi böyle hissediyorum."
"Tüm vücudum ağrıyor, adetimin gelmesi için daha 11 gün var ve bu süre beni çıldırtıyor."
"Sanki her şey beni mutsuz etmeye çalışıyor, adetim gelene kadar bu mutsuzluk geçmeyecek gibi."
"Bir haftadan fazla oldu, adetim hala gelmedi. Bunu beklemek çok yıpratıcı."
"Baş ağrılarım var, bu yüzden hibrite gittim ve 12mg zoloft aldım ve 25mg'a yükselttim."
"Uzun süredir baş ağrıları yaşıyordum, bu yüzden doktora gittim ve 12mg Zoloft ile başladık, şimdi 25mg'a çıktık."
"Baş ağrıları beni çok yordu, bu yüzden doktora gittim ve 12mg Zoloft ile tedaviye başladım, şimdi ise 25mg'a yükselttik."
"Baş ağrıları çok şiddetli olunca doktora gittim, 12mg Zoloft ile başladık ve şimdi 25mg'a kadar çıkardık."
"Baş ağrıları beni rahatsız ediyordu, bu yüzden doktora gittim ve 12mg Zoloft'a başladım, şimdi ise 25mg'a çıktık."
"Baş ağrılarından kurtulmak için doktora gittim, 12mg Zoloft ile başladık ve şimdi 25mg'a yükselttik."
Birkaç gün önce 10mg Lexapro'ya başladım.
"Yaklaşık bir hafta önce, kaygı ve depresyon için doktorumun bana verdiği Lexapro'ya başladım."
Geçen hafta doktorumun önerdiği 10mg'lık Lexapro tedavisine başladım.
Kaygılarımla başa çıkmak için yaklaşık bir hafta önce 10mg Lexapro almaya başladım.
"Yaklaşık bir hafta önce, ruh halimi dengelemek için Lexapro almaya başladım."
"Geçen hafta doktorumun önerdiği Lexapro'ya başladım, umarım işe yarar."
"Kronik bir hastalığım var, bu yüzden yöntemlerini öğrenmek veya değiştirmekle ilgilenmeyen küçümseyici doktorlara aşinayım."
"Uzun süredir devam eden bir rahatsızlığım yüzünden, kendi yöntemlerini değiştirmeye açık olmayan doktorlarla sık sık karşılaşıyorum."
"Kronik bir rahatsızlık yaşayan biri olarak, kendi yöntemlerine bağlı kalıp, yeni yöntemleri öğrenmeyi reddeden doktorlarla karşılaştım."
"Sürekli olarak mücadele ettiğim bir sağlık sorunum olduğu için, hastalarının ihtiyaçlarına kulak asmaktan ziyade kendi yöntemlerine bağlı kalan doktorları tanıdım."
"Yıllarca süren sağlık problemlerim nedeniyle, yeni çözümler bulmaktan ziyade sadece kendi yöntemlerine bağlı kalan doktorlarla tanıştım."
"Sağlığımla ilgili yaşadığım zorluklardan dolayı, hastalarının farklı ihtiyaçlarını anlamayan ve değişikliğe kapalı doktorlarla karşılaştım."
Ben yandım.
Ben bu aşkın ateşiyle kavruluyorum.
Bu durum beni içten içe kemiriyor.
Bu yaptığım yanlıştan dolayı çok pişmanım.
"Acı çekiyorum, çok kötü hissediyorum."
Yaptığım şeyin sonuçlarını ağır bir şekilde yaşıyorum.
"Ailemle, arkadaşlarımla, Dr. So'yla nefesimi boşa harcamayı bıraktım."
"Artık kimsenin ne dediğine aldırış etmiyorum, kendi yolumda ilerleyeceğim."
Kendimi artık başkalarını memnun etmeye çalışmakla yormayacağım.
Ben artık kimsenin beklentilerine göre yaşamayacağım.
Hayatımda artık benim için önemli olmayan insanlara zaman harcamayacağım.
Kendi mutluluğumu ön planda tutmaya karar verdim.
ı want wash the grumpy kızgın üzgün deplasmanda :(
"I'm feeling so down and frustrated, I just want to wash away all these bad feelings."
"Everything feels so overwhelming, I just need to wash away this stress and sadness."
"I'm feeling so tired and drained, I just want to wash away the day and go to bed."
"I'm so frustrated with everything, I just want to wash away all these negative emotions."
"I'm so discouraged and disheartened, I just want to wash away this feeling of defeat."
"DEHB'm var. Resmen teşhis kondu, yaş 32. Hormonların DEHB semptomlarını daha da kötüleştirdiğini göstermek için çok fazla araştırma var, bu yüzden dönemimden yaklaşık bir hafta önce deliriyorum (ama bazen de çevresinde)."
"DEHB'nin varlığı hayatımın birçok alanını etkiliyor, özellikle de dönemimden önceki haftalarda."
Hormonlarımın DEHB semptomlarımı nasıl etkilediğini bilmiyorum ama bu dönemde her şey çok daha zor.
"Araştırmacılar, dönem öncesi sendromunun DEHB semptomlarını şiddetlendirdiğini söylüyor ve ben bunun kesinlikle doğru olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Bir hafta öncesinden itibaren DEHB semptomları benim için dayanılmaz hale geliyor, sanki tüm zamanların en kötü hali yaşıyorum."
"Dönem öncesi sendromunun yaşattığı duygusal iniş çıkışlar, DEHB'nin getirdiği zorluklarla birleşince işler gerçekten kötüye gidiyor."
"Bazen SI, şişmiş, sık sık baş ağrıları ve uğraştığımız diğer eğlenceli şeylerle deli gibi hissetmeye başlıyorum."
"Sürekli yorgun hissetmek, uykusuzluk çekmek ve odaklanmakta zorlanmak, insanı gerçekten bunaltıcı hissettirebiliyor."
"Her gün aynı rutin, monoton bir iş hayatı ve yetersiz bir sosyal çevre, hayatın anlamını sorgulatmaya başlatıyor."
"Korkularımın beni ele geçirdiğini, geçmiş travmaların hayaletlerinin peşimi bırakmadığını ve bunların beni çaresiz hissettirdiğini düşünüyorum."
"Sıkıntılı bir ev ortamı, maddi sıkıntılar ve gelecek kaygısı, beynimi adeta kemiriyor."
"Bu yoğun tempo, sürekli rekabet ve hiç bitmeyen beklentiler, ruh halimi fazlasıyla etkiliyor, bazen her şeyden vazgeçmek istiyorum."
"Bazen arka arkaya 3 gün, bazen sadece 1 gün, bazen de farklı günlerde 2-3-4 kez. Ve genellikle fırtına beni alır, biraz sinirli veya kaşıntılı hissediyorum, düşüncelerimi yakalamak zor ve sonra sadece kırıyorum. Ağlayan, çığlık atan, her şey çok yanlış gibi geliyor, sanki herkes beni bir şekilde incitmek istiyor ve insanları uzaklaştırmaya başlıyor. Ama bu iki hafta boyunca paranoyak düşünceler alıyorum ve yaşla birlikte daha da kötüleşiyorlar."
"Depresyonun etkisi altındayken, bu hisler beni ele geçiriyor ve sanki her şey benimle ilgiliymiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Duygularım o kadar yoğun ki, etrafımdaki herkes bana karşı olduğunu düşünüyorum."
Beni anlayacak kimse yokmuş gibi hissediyorum ve bu da beni daha da üzüyor.
Hayatın zorluklarıyla başa çıkmak için mücadele ediyorum ve bu da bana çok yorgun hissettiriyor.
Bu durum benim için çok acı verici ve bu duyguların ne zaman geçeceğini bilmiyorum.
14 yaşımdan beri PMDD'm var ve hayatımı tamamen mahvetti. Hastanelere sürekli girip çıktım ve sakatlığa girmek zorunda kaldım çünkü çalışamıyorum ve kendimi güvende tutamıyorum.

"Bu hastalık nedeniyle hayatım çok zorlaştı, sürekli olarak hastanelere girip çıkıyorum ve çalışamıyorum, kendimi güvende hissetmiyorum."
"Bugün kendimi çok dışlanmış hissediyorum...Bundan çok yoruldum ve başka ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum. Gyno'm, müdahaleci düşüncelere yardımcı olmak için terapiden bahsetti...Görülmeye ihtiyaç duymaktan başka bir şey yayınlama amacımı bilmiyorum."
"Kendimi yalnız ve anlamsız hissediyorum, bu süreklilikten çok yorulduğumu hissediyorum."
"Başkalarına kendimi ifade edemediğimi,  duygularımı anlatabileceğim birini bulamadığımı hissediyorum."
"Hiçbir şeye ait olmadığımı düşünüyorum,  sanki hayatta bir yerim yokmuş gibi."
Bu sürekli dışlanma hissi beni içten içe kemiriyor ve beni çaresiz bırakıyor.
"Bu hislerle baş edemiyorum,  tek başıma mücadele edemeyeceğimi hissediyorum."
PMDD belirtilerimi bazen dönemimin ilk gününden iki hafta önce fark ettiğimi ve giderek kötüleştiğini hissediyorum.
PMDD belirtileri ilk belirtilerini dönemimden iki hafta önce hissetmeye başlıyorum ve her geçen gün daha kötüleşiyor.

Stresin verimliliğimi olumsuz etkilediğini düşünüyorum.
Stresin her şeyi daha da kötüleştirdiğini hissediyorum.
Ölmek istedim... şu anda başkalarının ölmesini istiyorum... intihara meyilli olmamayı tercih ederim.

"Hayatım çok zor, bazen ölmeyi düşünmeden edemiyorum ama başkalarının ölmesini istemek de çok korkunç."
"Bir an kendimi öldürmek istedim ama sonra düşündüm, başkalarının ölmesini istemeyi tercih ederim."
Ölmekten korkuyorum ama şu anda başkalarının ölmesini görmekten çok korkuyorum.
İntihar düşüncesi bile beni ürpertiyor ama şu anda insanların ölmesini görmemek için her şeyi yapardım.
Acaba kabul görecek miyim yoksa kurs yükünü bile kaldırabilecek miyim? Aynı zamanda değişimden ve ileriye bakacak iyi bir şey yokmuş gibi hissetmekten korkuyorum. Hiçbir şey hakkında kesinlikle iyimser hissetmiyorum. Sadece mevcut çaba sarf etmek zorundaymışım gibi hissediyorum.
Bu yeni rolün getirdiği sorumlulukları ve beklentileri karşılayabileceğimden emin değilim.
Her şeyin çok hızlı değiştiğini ve ayak uydurmakta zorlandığımı hissediyorum.

Kendimi bir yol ayrımında hissediyorum ve doğru seçimi yapmak için ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.
Genellikle yumurtlamadan hemen sonra boktan hissetmeye başlarım... Yataktan çıkmak istemiyorum. Daha iyisini hak ediyor. Sadece daha iyi hissetmek istiyorum.
"Her sabah uyanmak beni çok yorduyor, sanki kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Başım ağrıyor, yorgun hissediyorum, yataktan çıkmak istemiyorum, neden ben?"
"Uyandığımda kendimi iyi hissetmediğimde, tüm günüm mahvolmuş gibi geliyor."
"Keşke kendimi daha iyi hissetseydim, enerjik olsaydım, yapacak çok şey var."
"Bu hissi ne zaman atlatacağım bilmiyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor."
15 yaşındaki kızıma yakın zamanda PMDD teşhisi kondu... Adeti durmadı ve PMDD semptomları azalmadı.
"Kızımın PMDD'siyle mücadele etmek çok zor, hayatımız alt üst oldu."
"Kızımın PMDD'si onu çok etkiliyor, bazen kendini çok kötü hissediyor."
Doktora gittik ama PMDD için ne yapabileceğimizden emin değiliz.
"Umarım PMDD'si için bir çözüm bulunur, çok endişeleniyorum."
PMDD'siyle ilgili olarak kızımı desteklemek için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalışıyorum.
"Gülünç bir şekilde depresyona giriyorum ve bazen gerçekten kötüleşirse arkadaşlarımın beni izlemesi gerekiyor. Ya da zihnimden depresyona girmezsem her şeyin üstündeyim ya da en ufak bir şeye çok kızıyorum. Her zaman her şey.

Bunu durdurmak ve bana geri sallamak için elimden gelen her şeyi yapıyorum. Birkaç hafta boyunca tam anlamıyla patlamış psikoza giriyorum. Ben değilim. Gerçekten, tüm sevdiklerimin sırları, düğmeleri ve korkuları hakkında bilgi sahibi olan çılgın bir amcığa biniyorum."

"Bu yolculuk hiç kolay değildi, ama sonuçta umut vericiydi."
"Bir tanı almak rahatlatıcı olsa da, bu yalnızca savaşın başlangıcıydı."
"Daha önce hiç bu kadar kötü hissetmemiştim, sanki kendimden çıkmış gibiydim."
"Her şey çok hızlı oldu, ama en azından artık mücadele edebileceğim bir şeyim var."
İki kez ya da şimdi fark ettim ki kalbim birden çok hızlı atacak ve 4 dakika içinde yavaşça normale dönecek. İlk olarak 2023 yılının Ocak ayında fark ettim ve İK'm 160'a çıktı ve birkaç dakika içinde geri indi sanırım. Ve şimdi 11 Temmuz 2024'te tekrar fark ettim.
"Kalbimde garip bir hızlanma hissediyorum, sanki birden çok hızlı atıyor ve sonra yavaşça normale dönüyor."
"Son birkaç ayda bu hızlı kalp atışını birkaç kez yaşadım, ilk olarak Ocak ayında olmuştu."

"Tahmini dönem varışından 2 gün önce ve vardiyam başladıktan 2 saat sonra eve gitmek için işe gittim. Kendime bunu yapabileceğimi söylemek için gerçekten bütün gün uğraştım ama dayanılmaz. Sadece vardiyamı tamamlayamadığım için çok değersiz hissediyorum. Pazartesi günü 12 saatlik bir vardiyam var, nasıl idare edeceğimden emin değilim ama umarım edeceğim. Bu şekilde ne kadar daha fazla yaşayacağımdan emin değilim. Sadece iyi olmak istiyorum."
"İşim çok yoğun, bu yüzden gerçekten evde olmak istiyorum ama kendimi zorla işe gidiyorum."

"Ağlayarak hiçbir şey elde edemeyeceğimi biliyorum, ama duygularımı kontrol edemiyorum."
Sadece görünürdeki her şeyi yemek istiyorum ama aynı zamanda dünyadaki en şişman çirkin bok parçası gibi hissediyorum. Her şey beni kızdırıyor ve sadece kendimi incitmek istiyorum. Gerçekten sadece hayatın yaşamaya değer olmadığını düşünüyordum ve intihar etmeliyim. Tamamen farklı bir insan olduğumu hissediyorum. Herkese bağırmak ve tüm ilişkilerimi mahvetmek istiyorum. Her şeye kızıyorum ve bazen her şeyi mahvetmemek için mücadele ediyorum.

Dünyanın bana karşı olduğunu hissediyorum ve sadece kaçmak istiyorum. Her şey anlamını kaybetti.
Aynanın karşısına geçip kendimi gördüğümde tiksiniyorum. Benimle yaşamak imkansız.
Beni kimse anlamıyor ve artık kimseyle konuşmak bile istemiyorum. Sadece tek başıma yok olmak istiyorum.
"10 yıldır PMDD ile uğraşıyorum. Yaşlandıkça daha da kötüleşiyorum. Bir sürü tedavi denedim. Şu anda bir naturopatla çalışıyorum ve günde 22 takviye alıyorum. Fazla rahatlama sunmadı. Bir yıldır Sertralin'de (50mg) bulundum ve intihar düşüncelerinin bir kısmını uzak tutmaya yardımcı oldu, ancak bunun çok ötesinde değil."
PMDD ile yıllardır mücadele ediyorum ve maalesef yaşla birlikte durumum kötüleşiyor.
Birçok tedavi yöntemi denedim ama PMDD'nin etkileri azalmak yerine artıyor gibi.
Şu an doğal yollarla tedavi arıyorum ve bunun için günde 22 farklı takviye kullanıyorum.

"Bu hastalığın getirdiği yükü hafifletmek için birçok yol denedim, ama henüz tam bir çözüm bulamadım."
"Beni ziyaret eden iblisler çok güçlü ve onlarla nasıl savaşacağımı bilmiyorum. Şu anda histerik olarak, kaçınılmaz olduğu için, bunu değiştiremem ve bundan nefret ediyorum, çok."

"Bu acı verici durumdan kurtulamam, kaçınılmaz olduğu için bunu kabul etmem gerekiyor ve bu beni delirtiyor."
"Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapamam, sadece bu korkunç kaderi beklemek zorundayım."
"Beni mahveden bu güçlere karşı savaşma şansım yok, onların gücü benimkinin çok üzerinde."
"Bu durumun beni nasıl etkilediğini kontrol edemiyorum, bu düşünceler beni ele geçirmiş durumda ve ben onları durduramıyorum."

"Bu kadar zorlukla başa çıkamıyorum, sinirlerim bozuldu."
Uyanmak ve 7'deki toplantımı görmek iptal edilmedi
Uyandığımda ilk işim 7'deki toplantının iptal edilip edilmediğini kontrol etmek oldu.
Saat 7'de toplantım olduğunu hatırladım ve hemen iptal edilip edilmediğini kontrol ettim.
Uyandığımda ilk işim telefonumu kontrol etmek ve 7'deki toplantının iptal olup olmadığını görmek oldu.
Uyandığımda aklıma gelen ilk şey 7'deki toplantıydı ve hemen iptal edilip edilmediğini kontrol ettim.
"Sabah uyandığımda, toplantımın iptal edilip edilmediğini merak ederek telefonumu kontrol ettim."

"Bu durum beni gerçekten çok üzdü ve kendimi ağlarken buldum. Birçok insanın da aynı acıyı yaşadığını biliyorum, ancak her gün karşı karşıya kalmak zor."
"Bugün tekrar ağlamaya başladım. Bu, birçok insanı çok üzebilecek bir durum, ancak buna her gün şahit oluyorum. Bazı günler diğerlerinden daha zor."
"Tekrar gözlerim doldu. Bu, birçoğunu derin bir üzüntüye götürebilecek bir durum, ancak buna her gün şahit oluyorum. Bazı günler daha ağır oluyor."
Yine ağlamaya başladım. Biliyorum ki bu birçok insanı üzebilecek bir durum ama ben buna her gün şahit oluyorum. Bazı günler diğerlerinden daha zor.
Cevabımı çok düşündüm ve beni aşağı doğru bir spirale gönderiyor - ya bir daha onlarla çalışmamı istemezlerse? Ya yoluma çıkabilecek herhangi bir fırsat için yeterince iyi değilsem? Ya eğer?
"Bu durum beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor, çünkü iş teklifini kabul etmezlerse ne yapacağım?"
"Eğer işe alınmazsam, gelecekteki kariyerim için neler yapabilirim?"
Acaba yeterince iyi olduğumdan emin olabiliyor muyum?
Başvuru süreci boyunca her şeyi doğru yaptığımın garantisi var mı?
Bu fırsatı kaçırabileceğimden endişeleniyorum.
"PMDD'min üstünde OKB var ve son zamanlarda, bir psikiyatrik servis köpeği almayı tartışıyorum çünkü ilaçlarla bile işler kötüleşebilir.... Ne kadar adaletsiz olduğu konusunda homurdanmaya başladım... Duygularım dünden beri önemli ölçüde sakinleşti, ama dostum, sağlam bir üç saat boyunca tesellisizdim."
Bu ruhsal hastalıkların benim hayatımı nasıl altüst ettiğini görmek beni gerçekten üzüyor. İlaçlar bile yeterli olmayabiliyor ve bazen kendimi tamamen çaresiz hissediyorum.
"Psikiyatrik bir servis köpeğinin bana sağlayabileceği destek, hastalıklarımla mücadele etmek için bana çok yardımcı olabilir. En azından, her gün kendimi daha iyi hissetmemi sağlayabilir."
Günlük olarak yaşadığım bu duygusal iniş çıkışlarla başa çıkmak gerçekten zor. Bazen bu hastalıkların adaletsizliği yüzünden öfkeleniyorum ve kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum.
"Bu kadar karmaşık bir ruhsal sağlık durumuyla yaşamak çok yorucu. Her zaman destekleyici birilerinin olması, bu mücadelede yalnız olmadığımı hissetmemi sağlayabilir."
"İnsanların ruhsal sağlık sorunlarının farkındalığını artırmamız gerekiyor. Bu hastalıklar her zaman görünür olmayabilir, ancak etkileri çok gerçek ve acı verici olabilir."
"İçeri girdim, düğmeye bastığım yere gittim ve tabii ki ağladım."
"Çok heyecanlıydım, sonunda aradığım yere geldim ve gözyaşlarımı tutamadım."
"Oraya adımımı attığımda, nefesim kesildi ve gözyaşlarım kendiliğinden aktı."
"Uzun bir yolculuktan sonra hedefime ulaştım, ama mutluluktan ağlamaktan kendimi alamadım."
"Hedefime ulaşmıştım, ama duygusal yoğunluğun etkisiyle gözlerim doldu."
"O an için uzun zamandır bekliyordum, ve sonunda geldiğimde sevinç gözyaşlarımın durmasını sağlayamadım."
Fıstık ezmesini karıştırmak için neden bunu seçtim? Fıstık ezmesini karıştırmak neden bu kadar zor?
Fıstık ezmesini karıştırmak bu kadar mı zor olmalıydı?
Bu kadar uğraşmadan da fıstık ezmesini karıştırabilir miydim acaba?
Fıstık ezmesi neden bu kadar inatçı?
Fıstık ezmesini karıştırmak için daha kolay bir yol olmalı!
Fıstık ezmesiyle boğuşmak artık canımı sıkmaya başladı.
"Çocuklarımın hala küçük olmasını dileyerek parçalamaya devam ettim, sonra bc çok büyüyorlar ve uzaklaşmalarını istemiyorum"
"Çocuklarımın büyümesini ve beni unutmalarını hiç istemiyorum, keşke zaman durup onların küçük kalmalarını sağlayabilseydim."
"Çocuklarım büyüdükçe ve kendi hayatlarını kurdukça, onlarla geçirdiğim her anın kıymetini daha da iyi anlıyorum."
"Onlar hala küçükken, her anlarını yanımda geçirmek ve onların her adımına şahit olmak istiyorum."
"Çocuklarımın büyüdüğünü görmek beni hem mutlu ediyor hem de üzüyor, çünkü bir yandan bağımsız olmalarını görmek güzel, diğer yandan onların küçük çocukluk hallerini özlüyorum."
"Çocuklarımın büyümesini ve kendi hayatlarını kurmalarını görmek beni mutlu ediyor, ancak onların küçük yaşlarını da özlüyorum."

"Annelik yükü altında eziliyorum, sürekli yetersiz hissediyorum."
Kendime annelik görevlerini yerine getirmek için yeterince iyi olduğumu sorgulamaktan bıktım.
Sürekli annelik başarısızlıklarım konusunda endişelenmekten yorulduğum için bu duyguyu artık hissetmek istemiyorum.
Yataktan çıkamamak veya market alışverişine gitmek
Yatağımdan çıkmamak veya arkadaşımla buluşmak arasında kaldım.
Bu akşam eve gitmek veya bir partiye katılmak arasında tereddüt ediyorum.
İşten sonra direkt eve gitmek veya spor salonuna uğramak arasında karar veremiyorum.
Bu gece evde film izlemek veya sinemaya gitmek arasında kaldım.
Yazılım sınavına çalışmak veya arkadaşlarla buluşmak arasında kalmış bulunuyorum.
Kavanozu odanın öbür tarafına fırlatırdım
Kavanozu öfkeyle yere çalmak için fırlatırdım.
Kavanozu pencereden dışarıya fırlatmak için kollarımı zorlardım.
O kavanozun odaya çarpma sesini hayal edebiliyor musun?
Kavanozu odanın diğer ucuna fırlatıp cam kırıklarının sesini dinleyecektim.
O kavanozu fırlatıp kırdığımda ne kadar öfkeli olduğumu anlamıştın.
PMDD ve OKB profesyonel gibi muameleye atladılar.

"Uykusuzluğum var, sadece bunun sağlığıma ne kadar zarar verdiğini ve muhtemelen kısalttığını düşünmeye devam ediyorum. ve kapalı günlerimde çevirmek yerine sadece bir gece programında kalırsam, sevdiklerimi asla görmemek için depresyona gireceğim."
"Uykusuzluk beni tüketiyor, hem fiziksel hem de ruhsal olarak.  Bu şekilde devam edemezsem, kendimi kaybedeceğimi hissediyorum."
"Uyku yoksunluğu beni delirtiyor.  Sadece birkaç saat uyuyabiliyorum ve kendimi bitkin hissediyorum.  Eğer bu durum böyle devam ederse, sağlığımı tamamen kaybedeceğim."
"Uykusuzluk beni çok yoruyor,  ne işime ne de sosyal hayatıma konsantre olamıyorum.  Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum,  sanki bu uykusuzluk bir ceza gibi."
"Geceleri uyuyamamak  hayatımı mahvediyor.   Çalışamıyorum,  eğlenemiyorum,  sevdiklerimle vakit geçiremiyorum.  Ne zaman bitecek?"
"Her gece aynı şey, saatlerce uyuyamamak ve sabah uyandığımda yorgun ve bitkin hissetmek.  Bu durum beni çok endişelendiriyor,  sağlığımı ve hayatımı tehdit ediyor."
Üzüntüden ve dehşetten.
Üzüntü ve dehşet beni tamamen sarıp sarmaladı.
"İçimde, üzüntü ve dehşetin bir karışımı vardı."
"O an, üzüntü ve dehşet bir fırtına gibi üzerime çöktü."
Üzüntüden ve dehşetten ne yapacağımı bilemedim.
"Üzüntü ve dehşet, ruhumu derin bir karanlığa sürükledi."
Davranışsal sağlık hastanesinden intihar düşüncesi ve alkol bağımlılığı/detoks nedeniyle az önce taburcu edildim.
"Tedavi gördüğüm davranışsal sağlık hastanesinden bugün taburcu oldum, intihar düşüncelerim ve alkol bağımlılığımla başa çıkmak için desteğe ihtiyacım var."
"Hastaneden ayrıldım ama içimde hala çok fazla şey var, alkol bağımlılığım ve intihar düşüncelerim beni endişelendiriyor."

"Hastaneden çıktım ama aklım hala karmakarışık, intihar düşüncelerim ve alkol bağımlılığımla başa çıkmayı düşünüyorum."
"Tedavi sürecim bitti ama yolun başındayım, intihar düşüncelerimle ve alkol bağımlılığımla mücadele etmek için daha çok çalışmam gerekiyor."
O kadar acı çekiyorum ki biraz ağladım.
"Çok fazla acı içindeyim, gözlerim doldu."
"Bu kadar acıya dayanamıyorum, biraz ağlamak zorunda kaldım."
"Acı o kadar yoğun ki, kendimi tutamadım ve ağladım."
"Bedenimde hissettiğim acı dayanılmaz, ağlamamak elde değil."
"Bu acının beni nasıl da yıprattığını hissediyorum, gözyaşlarım kendiliğinden aktı."
Bunun ağlamak için çok anlaşılabilir bir sebep olduğunu hissediyorum. Adet dönemimde olmasam bile ağlardım.
"Bu durum gerçekten üzücü, ağlamamak elde değil."
Herkes benim yerimde olsaydı ağlardı diye düşünüyorum.
"Bu kadar kötü bir şey yaşanmışken, ağlamamak mümkün değil."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, ağlamadan duramıyorum."
"Böyle bir durum karşısında herkes ağlar, ben de ağlayabilirim."
Genelde ağlayan biri değilimdir ama son birkaç yıldır beni çok ağlatıyordu.

Kötü bir anıyı yeniden yaşa. Sadece CPTSD şeyleri..
Korkunç bir anıya geri dönüp bakmak istemiyorum ama yapmam gerekiyor.
Geçmişin beni sürekli olarak takip ediyor ve ondan kaçmak imkansız.
Bu anılar benimle sonsuza dek kalacak ve ben onlardan asla kurtulamayacağım.
Kendimi bir kabusa hapsolmuş gibi hissediyorum ve uyanamıyorum.
Bu travmanın beni ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum ve kendimi kontrol edemiyorum.
Kullandığı ton yüzünden hıçkırmaya başladım.
Kullandığı sözler o kadar ağır ve kırıcıydı ki gözyaşlarımı tutamadım.
"Sesi ve bakışları o kadar sertti ki, kendimi tutamayıp ağlamaya başladım."
"O an bana hissettirdiği aşağılama duygusu, yüreğimi burktu ve hıçkırıklarla ağlamaya başladım."
"Tonu ve sözleri bana karşı o kadar iticiydi ki, kendimi tutamayıp gözyaşlarımı döktüm."
"Sözleri ve tonu o kadar sert ve acımasızdı ki, kalbim paramparça oldu ve ağlamaya başladım."
"Sana çeneni daynch ve derin bir nefes al, iyi olacağını söyleyen o instagram makaralarına ağlamak"
Sana rahatlaman gerektiğini söyleyen o sahte mutluluk dolu internet videolarına bakmak beni deli ediyor.
O her şeyi çözmüş gibi gösteren motivasyon videolarını izleyince kendimi daha kötü hissediyorum.
Her şeyin yolunda olduğunu ima eden o pozitif mesajlar beni sadece daha da sinirlendiriyor.
Hayatın mükemmel olduğunu söyleyen o sahte videoları gördükçe içimde bir öfke beliriyor.
Her şeyin yolunda olacağına dair güvence veren o klişe mesajlar beni daha da kötü hissettiriyor.
Gözlerim otoimmün eşyalarımdan o kadar kuru ki aslında ağlayamıyorum.
"Gözlerim, o kadar kuru ki aslında gülümseyemiyorum."
"Yüzümdeki maske, hissettiklerimi yansıtmamı engelliyor."
Bu hisleri ifade etmenin yolunu bulduğuma inanamıyorum.
"Kelimeler, ne hissettiğimi ifade etmekte yetersiz kalıyor."
"Sözcükler, benim için çok ağır geliyor."
"Bütün gün içki içmesiyle sona erdi ve sonra onunla evine geri döndü, sözde pizza aldılar ve kanepesinde bayıldı ve yatağında uyudu. Geçen hafta sonu bu olaydan önce onu görmedim. Metinde uyumasıyla konuyu çok kısa bir şekilde tartıştık. Ama telefon yok. Ve şahsen değil. Ve kesinlikle bu konuda ciddi bir konuşma yapmak istiyorum, şahsen."
"O geceki olaylar beni çok rahatsız etti, onunla konuşmam gerekiyor."
"O geceki davranışları beni gerçekten endişelendirdi, onunla durumu net bir şekilde konuşmam şart."
"Ona olan güvenimi kaybettim, bu konuyu açıklığa kavuşturmak zorundayım."
"Bu konuyu kapatmadan rahat edemem, onunla yüzleşmeliyim."
"Bu olaydan sonra ne hissettiğini anlamak istiyorum, bu konuyu konuşmalıyız."
Yatak odamdaki çarşaflar milyonuncu kez patlıyor.
Yatak odamdaki çarşaflar her seferinde yıkamada daha da yıpranıyor.
"Yatak odamdaki çarşaflar eski ve yıpranmış, her an yırtılacak gibi."
"Yatak odamdaki çarşaflar artık dayanmıyor, her seferinde yıkanınca daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Yatak odamdaki çarşafların iplikleri artık çözülüyor, sanki her an parçalanacakmış gibi."
"Yatak odamdaki çarşaflar yıkanmaya bile tahammül edemiyor, artık yenilerini almam gerek."
Çok kötü bırakmak istediğim için ağladım ama bu ekonomide yapamam
Bırakmak istediğim işten ayrılmayı çok istiyorum ama ekonomik koşullar nedeniyle bunu yapamam.

"İşten ayrılma düşüncesi beni çok üzüyor, ama şu ekonomide başka bir iş bulmak zor."
İşimi çok sevmiyorum ama ekonomik zorluklar nedeniyle devam etmek zorundayım.
"Bu işten nefret ediyorum, bırakmak istiyorum ama bu ekonomide yeni bir iş bulmak imkansız gibi."
Yemeğim çatalımdan düşerken onu yemek için ağzıma getiriyordum.

Çatalı ağzıma götürürken bir anda yemeği bıraktım.
Uyuyamamak
Uykuya dalmakta zorlanıyorum.
Uyku benim için imkansız gibi görünüyor.
"Gözlerim açık, ama zihnim uyanık."
"Uykuya dalmak yerine, düşüncelerim beni rahatsız ediyor."
Saatlerdir yatakta dönüp duruyorum.
"Menajerimle bir video görüşmesinde kısa bir süre ağlayarak sona erdi, sadece talihsiz şeylerin olduğu uzun bir hafta oldu."
Bu hafta gerçekten zor geçti ve menajerimle yaptığım video görüşmesinde sonunda duygularımın önüne geçemedim.
"Uzun bir haftayı geride bıraktım, bir sürü talihsizlik yaşadım ve menajerimle video görüşmesinde duygularımın kontrolünü kaybettim."
"Menajerimle video görüşmesi, bu haftanın tüm yükünün omuzlarıma bindiği bir şekilde duygusal bir şekilde sona erdi."
Talihsizlikler ve sorunlarla dolu bir haftadan sonra menajerimle olan video görüşmemde ağlamaya başladım.
Bu hafta çok şey yaşadım ve menajerimle olan video görüşmesinde sonunda duygularımı kontrol edemeyip ağladım.
Havanın güzel olduğu ve genellikle bu olduğunda depresyon ve anksiyetemin yükseldiğini hissetmeye başladığım ve coşkulu hissettiğim için ağladım. Adetim herhangi bir gün başlıyor... coşku gelmedi.
"Hava gerçekten harika ve kendimi mutlu hissetmeliyim ama bunun yerine daha da kötü hissediyorum, depresyon ve anksiyete beni gerçekten etkiliyor."
"Güzel bir gün ama ne yazık ki anksiyetem ve depresyonum yüzünden iyi hissetmiyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor."
"Dışarısı harika ama içerideki fırtına daha da kötü, depresyon ve anksiyete beni ele geçiriyor."
Havanın güzel olduğu günlerde mutlu olmayı beklerdim ama sanki depresyon ve anksiyete beni daha da kötü hissettiriyor.
"Dışarısı güneşli ama ben bu hissi içimde hissetmiyorum, sanki anksiyete ve depresyonum daha da güçleniyor."
Bu beni ayın herhangi bir günü ağlatırdı.
"Bu, benim için her zaman çok üzücü bir anı."
"Bu durum, benim için ne zaman yaşanırsa yaşansın çok acı verici."
Herhangi bir günde bu olayı hatırlamak beni çok üzüyor.
Bu anı düşünmek bile beni çok duygulandırıyor.
"Bu, benim için her zaman çok zor bir konu."
Çok üzgünüm.
Çok kötü hissediyorum.
Bu gerçekten üzücü.
Kendimi kötü hissediyorum.
Bunu duyduğuma üzüldüm.
Lütfen beni affet.
"Bir trafik sıkışıklığı, öfke, hayal kırıklığı ve ezici haksızlık alırdım."
Her gün bu trafiğe girmek insanı deli ediyor.
Bu trafik yüzünden her gün stres doluyor.
"Şu trafik nedeniyle işime geç kalacağım, bu gerçekten çok sinir bozucu."
Saatlerce trafikte kalmak inanılmaz bir zaman kaybı.
"Bu trafiğin sonu yok mu, her gün aynı şey."
"Lanet olsun, tüm bunlar aynı anda gerçekleştiği için üzgünüm."
Her şeyin üst üste geldiği için gerçekten çok üzgünüm.
Bu kadar çok şeyin birden bire olması beni gerçekten bunalttı.
Aynı anda bu kadar çok şeyin olması benim için de zor.
Her şeyin birden bire olması sinir bozucu.
Bu kadar çok şeyin birden bire olması beni gerçekten strese soktu.
"Ölen sevdiğiniz kişinin evini kaybettiğinizde. Yaralanmaya hakaret gibi geliyor. 2016 yılında bu tam üzüntüden geçtim. Büyükannem, zonalarla çok hastalandıktan sonra zil felci ile sakatlanınca sakin kulübesinden taşınmak zorunda kaldı. Sağlığı bozuldu ve 2019'da domino dalgası gibi çarpan daha fazla sağlık komplikasyonundan öldü. Hala onu ve rahat evini özlüyorum."
"Sevdiğiniz birini kaybetmek yeterince acı verici, ancak onların evini de kaybettiğinizde, yaraya tuz basılmış gibi hissediyorsunuz."
"Bir kayıp yaşamışken eski evlerini görmenin imkansız olması, kalbinize ekstra bir ağırlık bindiriyor."
"Büyükannemin evi onun kimliğinin bir parçasıydı, onu kaybetmesi sadece onu değil, aynı zamanda bir parçasını da kaybettiğimiz anlamına geliyordu."
"Evi kaybetmenin acısı, sevdiğimiz kişiyle yaşadığımız anıları silmek gibi hissettiriyor."
"Evi sadece bir yapı değil, sevdiklerimizin anılarıyla dolu bir alan, bu yüzden kaybı daha da acı verici hale getiriyor."
Uygulamaları açar ve ağlardım
Uygulamaları kullanmak ve ağ kurmak zamanımı alıyor.
Günümün büyük bir kısmını uygulamaları açmak ve ağlarla uğraşmakla geçiyor.
Benim için uygulamaları açıp ağlarla bağlantı kurmak her zaman zorlu bir görev.
Uygulamaları açıp ağlara bağlanmak benim için adeta bir rutin haline geldi.
Uygulamaları açmak ve ağları yönetmek benim en sevdiğim aktivitelerden biri değil.
Kuzenim ve ben otistik olsa da spektrumda farklı uçlardayız.
Kuzenim ve ben otizm spektrumunda farklı yerlerde olduğumuzu fark ettik.
"Aramızdaki otizm spektrumu farkı, otizm deneyimlerimizi de farklı kılıyor."
"Otizmimiz olmasına rağmen, spektrumda farklı yerlerde olmak bizim için bir ayrıcalık."
"Otizm spektrumundaki farklı konumlarımız nedeniyle, dünyayı farklı şekillerde deneyimliyoruz."
"Otizmimiz, her birimizi farklı şekillerde etkilediği için, spektrumda farklı yerlerde olmak bizim için doğal."
Ağladım çünkü onları kullanmaya bile dayanamıyorum.
Onları kullanmak bile beni çok üzüyor.
Kullanmak bile istemediğim için ağladım.
Onları kullanmaya çalıştığımda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Kullanmaya çalıştığımda dayanamayıp ağlıyorum.
Onları kullanmak bile benim için çok acı verici.
Bunun için ayın herhangi bir günü ağlayacağım.
Bu yüzden her gün ağlamak istiyorum.
Her gün bunun için üzüleceğim.
Bu konuda her zaman üzgün olacağım.
Bu durum beni her gün ağlatacak.
Bu acıyı her gün hissedeceğim.
Gerçekten acımla gülüyorum...!!! (Hala buna üzülsem de)
Acı içindeyim ama buna gülmekten kendimi alamıyorum.
Bu durumdan çok üzgünüm ama yine de gülmekten kendimi alamıyorum.
Bu kadar üzüldüğüm halde gülmekten kendimi alamıyorum.
İnanılmaz bir acı içindeyim ama gülmemek elde değil.
Üzgün olduğumu biliyorum ama buna gülmeden edemiyorum.
Neredeyse bir hafta sonra hala ağlıyorum.
Bir haftadan fazla geçti ama hala unutamıyorum.
"Hala gözlerim doluyor, bir hafta geçti bile."
Ne kadar zaman geçtiyse de hala üzgünüm.
Bir haftadan fazla oldu ama sanki dün gibi.
Zaman geçmesine rağmen acısı dinmiyor.
Bugün çok kötü.
Bugün hiç iyi gitmiyor.
Bugün her şey ters gidiyor.
Bugün içimde bir burukluk var.
Bugün moralim çok bozuk.
Bugün her şey beni üzüyor.
Ay'ın karanlık tarafım bunu bilmiyor
Benim hakkında bilmedikleri çok şey var.
İnsanlar benim gerçek benliğimi asla bilemeyecek.
Gizli yönlerimi kimse göremez.
Onlar benim gizli dünyamdan habersizler.
Benim derinliklerimi kimse keşfedemez.
Hissediyordum. Bu konuda araştırma yapmaya ve bu konuda daha fazla bilgi edinmeye başlarken bazı sorularım var... o kadar çok duygu kafamdan geçiyor ki. Umarım dışarıda bana tavsiyelerde bulunabilecek bazı anneler vardır:
"Benim için çok önemli bir konu bu, üzerine düşünmek, öğrenmek istiyorum. Ama o kadar çok sorum var ki, kafam karıştı."
"Bu konu hakkında gerçekten bilgi sahibi olmak istiyorum, ne kadar çok şey öğrenebilirim bilmiyorum."
"Bu konuyu kafamda çok döndürüyorum, hissettiklerimi, düşüncelerimi anlamaya çalışıyorum."
"Bu konuda yol gösterici olabilecek birini arıyorum, çünkü kendi başıma çözebileceğimi düşünmüyorum."
"Çok fazla duygu içindeyim, kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum, bana yardımcı olabilecek biri var mı?"
Ben ya da hayatımdaki başka bir şeyin var olup olmaması umurumda değildi... Çok umutsuz ve değersizdim... Zihinsel olarak çok kısa bir sürede geçtim... Kendimi ve hayatımı gerçekten kötü bir şekilde mahvetmek için hızlı bir yoldaymış gibi kendime doğru hareket ediyordum.
Benim varlığımın ya da hayatımdaki diğer şeylerin bir anlamı olup olmadığı umurunda değildi... Hayatın anlamsız ve boş olduğunu düşünüyordum...
"Hiçbir şey umurumda değildi, her şey boş ve anlamsız geliyordu... Kendimi derin bir boşlukta hissediyordum..."
Varoluşumun veya yokluğumun bir fark yaratmadığına inanıyordum... Değersiz ve umutsuz hissediyordum...
Hayatımın bir amacı olmadığını düşünüyordum... Kendimi bir hiç olarak görüyordum ve kendimi yok etmeye doğru gidiyordum...
Her şey bana boş ve anlamsız geliyordu... Kendimi umutsuzluğa teslim etmiştim ve hayatımdaki her şeyi mahvetmeye hazır gibiydim...
Her gece saat 5'e kadar ayakta olmaktan çok yoruldum.
Geç saatlere kadar uyanık kalmaktan bıktım.
Her gece geç saatlere kadar çalışmak beni yordu.
Artık her gece geç saatlere kadar uyanık kalmaya dayanamıyorum.
Sabah erken kalkmam gerektiği için geç saatlere kadar uyanık kalamam.
"Uyku düzenim tamamen bozuldu, her gece geç saatlere kadar ayakta kalıyorum."
"Çatıda kaygı, sırt ağrısı sırtımın yarısı, mide twinges, yorgunluk ve meme ağrısı"
"Yaşadığım bu kaygı beni tamamen yıktı, sanki bedenim çatırdıyor."
"Sırt ağrısı, mide bulantısı, yorgunluk, meme ağrısı, her şey birbirine karıştı."
"Ruh halim çökük, bedenim ağrıyor, ne yapacağımı bilemiyorum."
"Kaygı, ağrı, yorgunluk... Neredeyse her yerim ağrıyor."
"Her şeyden yoruldum, sanki bedenim artık taşıyamıyor."
"Beyin sisi HORRIBLE'dir. Araba kullanmamam gerektiğini hissediyorum. Daha önce kaldırımlara çarptım ama SADECE luteal sırasında oldu... Her zaman ""Bunu söyledim mi?"" ile cevap veriyorum. Sürekli sadece yüzüyorum ve söylediklerimi, neler olduğunu gerçekten işlemediğimi hissediyorum."
"Beyin sisi beni tamamen devre dışı bırakıyor, bugün hiçbir şey yapamam."
"Beyin sisiyle araba kullanmak çok tehlikeli, kendimi kontrol edemediğimi hissediyorum."

"Sanki bir filmde yaşıyor gibi hissediyorum, kendimde değilim, her şey çok gerçek dışı geliyor."
"PMDD ilişkilerim, iş ahlakı gibi her şeyi etkiledi ve genel olarak beni normalden daha huysuz / depresif hale getirdi. Eski sevgilimle, dönemim boyunca ondan ayrılma ihtiyacı hissettim... Çok kötü hissettim ama ona bunun aşırı bağlanma tarzım + pmdd nedeniyle olduğunu söyledim ve sadece onu kabul ediyorum. Bu ay, onunla ilgili aşırı endişe duyuyordum, çünkü sadece onunla birlikteyim ve yeniden ortaya çıkıyordum."
"PMDD, işime ve ilişkilerime olumsuz etki ediyor, beni sinirli ve depresif hissettiriyor."
"Dönemlerim boyunca ilişkilerim gerçekten zorlaşıyor, aşırı tepki veriyorum ve kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini anlamadığı için ilişkimde zorluklar yaşıyorum, bu yüzden onu sürekli olarak bilgilendirmek zorunda hissediyorum."
"Geçmişte PMDD nedeniyle ilişkilerimde ayrılma ihtiyacı hissettim, çünkü kendimi aşırı duygusal ve kontrolsüz hissediyordum."
"Bu ay özellikle zorlu geçiyor, çünkü PMDD belirtileri yeniden ortaya çıktı ve ilişkimde güvensizlikler yaşıyorum."
Para çekme sürecinden geçiyordum. Bir dolum alamadım ve sadece 2 hafta boyunca üzerindeydim ve sigorta ile ilgili bir sorun olduğu için daha fazla dolum alamadım. Para çekmelere neyin neden olduğundan emin değilim.
"Sigorta ile ilgili bir sorun olduğu için 2 haftadır para çekme işlemiyle uğraşıyorum, bir dolum dahi alamadım."
"Para çekme işlemi beni gerçekten yoruyor, bu 2 haftadır dolum alamıyorum ve nedenini de bilmiyorum."
"Sigorta sorunu yüzünden 2 hafta boyunca para çekme işlemini bekliyorum, ne zaman dolum alabileceğim belli değil."
"2 hafta boyunca dolum alamadım ve sebebi sigorta ile ilgili bir sorunmuş, ne zaman biteceğini de bilmiyorum."
"Para çekme işlemiyle uğraşmak çok zor, 2 haftadır dolum alamıyorum ve nedenini de bilmiyorum."
PMDD yönetimimle nispeten iyi yapıyorum
PMDD'yi yönetmek için kendime iyi bir yol buldum.
PMDD'nin hayatımı çok fazla etkilemediğini düşünüyorum.
PMDD semptomlarını kontrol altında tutmayı başardım.
PMDD ile mücadele etmek için kullandığım yöntemler işe yarıyor.
PMDD'den pek etkilenmediğimi söyleyebilirim.
Ben sadece gerçekten cinsel olarak hayal kırıklığına uğradım. Kırbaçlamak ve onu dışarı çıkarmak istemiyorum çünkü genel olarak gerçekten önemli değil.. Kendimi bok gibi hissediyorum çünkü terapistime onu anlattım ve utanıyorum
"Ben gerçekten ilişkinin duygusal tarafında hayal kırıklığına uğradım, fiziksel kısım için aynı şeyi hissetmiyorum, bu yüzden sadece devam etmek istemiyorum."
Sanki kendimi yeterince ilgi çekici bulmuyorum ve bu da ilişkimizde bir engel yaratıyor.
Olayların sadece bencil ve önemsiz hissettirdiğini hissediyorum. 
Bir ilişkiye girmek için yeterince heyecanlı olduğumu düşünmüyorum ve o yüzden de devam etmek istemiyorum. 
"Terapistimle konuştuğumda ne kadar kötü hissettiğimi fark ettim, ilişkimde mutlu olmuyorum ama bunu itiraf etmeye hazır değilim."
luteal fazdaki hormonal değişiklikler tuvaleti daha sık kullanmama neden oluyor
Luteal fazda yaşadığım hormonal dalgalanmalar nedeniyle tuvalete daha sık gitmek zorunda kalıyorum.
"Adet döngümün bu aşamasındaki hormonal değişiklikler, tuvalete daha sık gitme ihtiyacına neden oluyor."
"Hormonal dengesizlikler, özellikle luteal fazda, sık idrara çıkmama neden oluyor."
Luteal fazdaki hormonal değişiklikler nedeniyle tuvalet ihtiyacım arttı.
"Bu dönemdeki hormonal değişikliklerden dolayı, tuvaleti daha sık kullanmak zorunda kaldığımı fark ettim."
"Herhangi bir belirli noktada değil gibi kaşınıyorum, ancak tüm vücudum sürünüyormuş gibi hissediyor mu? Ya da cildin ilk tabakası gibi, bazen sıcak ve sokmalar hissediyor."
"Herhangi bir yer değil de sanki tüm bedenimde bir karıncalanma var, anlayabiliyor musun?"
"Bu hissi tarif edemiyorum, sanki her tarafımda küçük böcekler koşuyor gibi."
"İçeride, derinlerde bir sıcaklık var, sanki cildimde yanma hissi var."
"Sanki küçük iğneler batıyor gibi, ama acımıyor, sadece tuhaf bir his."
"Vücudumda bir gariplik var, sanki kendime ait değilmiş gibi."
"Cinayeti düşündüm. Sanki gerçekten ona bağlanmayacaktım, ama gerçek anlamda herhangi birine o kadar kızgın ve öfkeli hissettim ki, katil fantezilere karşı harekete geçme dürtüsüm var. Bu öfkeyi dışarı çıkarmanın bir yolu olarak çığlık atmak için boş otoparklara gitmek zorunda kaldım."
"Kendimi kontrol altında tutamayacağımı hissediyordum, sanki bir canavara dönüşüyordum."
"Öfke beni tüketiyordu, her şeyden önce o adamı yok etmek istiyordum."
"O kadar öfkeliydim ki, onu hayal meyal bir şekilde cezalandırma fikri beni rahatlatıyordu."
"Elimden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalıştım, ama öfkenin beni ele geçirdiğini hissedebiliyordum."
"Bazen, o adamla ilgili düşünceler beni gece geç saatlere kadar uyanık tutuyor, neredeyse kontrolümü kaybedecek gibi oluyordum."
"PMDD ile yerel grafik tasarımcısı, luteal fazında hayatta kalmaya çalışıyor"
PMDD'nin belirtileriyle başa çıkmak için her ayın son haftası benim için gerçek bir mücadele.
"Luteal fazın getirdiği duygusal iniş çıkışlarla başa çıkmak, özellikle de bir grafik tasarımcıysanız, oldukça zorlayıcı olabilir."
Her ay luteal fazın gelmesiyle beraber PMDD'nin getirdiği zorluklarla karşı karşıya kalıyorum.
Grafik tasarımcı olarak işimi yaparken PMDD'nin getirdiği duygusal iniş çıkışlarla başa çıkmak çok yorucu.
"PMDD ile uğraşırken yaratıcı işimi yapmak, özellikle de luteal fazda, oldukça zorlayıcı olabiliyor."
Dönemimden önce/dönem sırasında intihar düşünceleri... Yeme alışkanlıklarım ay boyunca da değişiyor ya dipsiz bir çukurum ya da hiç yemiyorum.
"Duygusal iniş çıkışlarım o kadar yoğun ki, bir anda mutluluk, bir anda derin bir üzüntü yaşıyorum."
"Bu dönemde duygularımla başa çıkmak gerçekten zor. Öyle bir halde oluyorum ki, ya hiç konuşmuyorum ya da durmadan konuşuyorum."
"Enerji seviyem de dönem dönem çok dalgalı. Bazen her şeye gücüm yetiyor, bazen ise yataktan kalkmak bile çok zor geliyor."
Kendimi tamamen yalnız hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor. Sanki dünyada kimse beni anlamıyor.
Bu dönemde uyku düzenim de alt üst oldu. Ya hiç uyuyamıyorum ya da sürekli uyuyorum.
"Her zaman yeterince zeki olamayacağımı ya da yeterince bilemeyeceğimi hissettim ve bunun için bir insan olarak var olma hakkını hak etmiyorum. Çok fazla unutkanlık yaşıyorum, yazım sorunlarım var, basit kelimeleri okuyorum ve hatta para sayıyorum. Ailem, iyi bilgilendirilmediğim bir konu hakkında sorular sorduğumda veya sorduğum için kendinizi kesinlikle aptal hissetmenizi sağladığında yoğun tepkileriyle bunu daha kolay hale getirmiyor."
Kendimi akıllı veya bilgili hissetmediğimde yeterince iyi olmadığımı düşünüyorum ve bu nedenle var olmaya layık olmadığımı hissediyorum.
"Öğrenme güçlüklerim ve unutkanlığım, bencilce davranıp beni aptal gibi hissettirerek, ailesel ilişkilerimi daha da zorlaştırıyor."
"Yazım hatalarım, kelimeleri okuyamamak ve para saymakta zorluk çekmek, benim kendime olan güvenimi ve değerimi zedeliyor."
"Eksik bilgilerimden dolayı ailem tarafından eleştirilmek, özgüvenimi sarsıyor ve yetersiz hissetmeme neden oluyor."
"Bazen kendimi diğer insanlardan daha az zeki hissediyorum, özellikle de ailenin eleştirileriyle karşılaştığımda, bu da bana var olma hakkımı sorgulamama neden oluyor."
Diferansiyel teşhisim yukarıdakilerin hepsidir ve ayrıca BPD özelliklerini de içerir.
Bu hastalığın olası nedenleri yukarıda listelenenlerin hepsini kapsıyor ve bunun yanında BPD belirtilerine de işaret ediyor.
Görünüşe göre bu durum hem yukarıda bahsedilenleri hem de BPD'ye özgü belirtileri içeriyor.
"Tanımlamada, önceki olasılıklara ek olarak, Borderline Kişilik Bozukluğu'nun karakteristik özelliklerinin de mevcut olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Klinik olarak, bu durum yukarıda ele alınan tüm olasılıkları içerir ve Borderline Kişilik Bozukluğu ile örtüşen yönleri de barındırır."
Hastanın durumu hem bahsedilen diğer olasılıkları hem de BPD'ye özgü semptomları içeriyor.
Duygusuz bir şekilde gözüm açık hissediyorum - tüm döngünün var olduğu sorunlar çıplak yatıyor... Garip bir şekilde rahatlatıcı olan lutealde duygularıma biraz daha güvenebileceğimi hissediyorum? Sorunlar her zaman oradadır ama ben onlara pozitif duyguların minderi olmadan daha ham bir şekilde maruz kalıyorum.
"Yaşadığım sıkıntılar açık ve net, sanki bir perde çekilip de gerçekler çıplak gözlerime serilmiş gibi. Ama garip bir şekilde bu beni sakinleştiriyor; duygusal bir filtre olmadan onlara daha doğrudan bakabildiğim için."
"Duygusal karmaşa içindeyken sorunları sanki bir sis perdesinin arkasında gizlenmiş gibi algılıyor gibiydim ama şimdi, sakin bir zihnimle baktığımda hepsi orada duruyor. Bu açıklık bana garip bir rahatlama veriyor."
"Duyguların yoğunluğunda, bazı sorunları göz ardı ediyor veya hafife alıyordum. Şimdi, sakin ve net bir bakış açısıyla gerçeklerle yüzleşmek bana biraz özgürlük getiriyor."
"Bu sakinlik içinde, sanki kendimden ve yaşamadığım duygulardan arındırılmış gibi hissediyorum. Bu bana, sorunları gerçek haliyle, herhangi bir duygu katmanı olmadan görebilme yeteneği sağlıyor."
"Her zaman orada olan sorunları, daha önce duyguların etkisiyle görmezden geliyordum. Şimdi duygusal bir filtre olmadan, çıplak gerçekle yüzleşmek bana garip bir şekilde dinginlik veriyor."
"Anksiyete şiddetlidir, pmdd sıkıntı artı kaygı."
"Anksiyetem gerçekten kötüleşti, PMS'den kaynaklanan sinirlilik ve endişe üzerine eklendi."
"Endişelerim kontrolden çıktı, şimdi de PMS'den kaynaklanan bir huzursuzluk eklendi."
"Daha önce hiç bu kadar endişeli hissetmemiştim, üstüne bir de PMS'den kaynaklanan rahatsızlık eklendi."
"Bu anksiyete dayanılmaz, sanki PMS'den kaynaklanan ek bir endişe var."
"Endişelerimle baş edemiyorum, PMS'den kaynaklanan kaygının da üstüne binmesiyle daha da kötüleşti."
"Tam üflenmiş grip olduğumu hissettim. Yaklaşık bir haftadır hissettiğim aynı titreme, vücut ağrıları, tahriş olmuş gözler ve yorgunlukla uyandım."
"Grip olmaktan başka bir şeye benzemiyordu. Tüm belirtiler oradaydı: titreme, vücut ağrıları, gözlerim yanıyordu ve yorgundum."
"Sabah uyandığımda kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum. Vücudum ağrıyor, titriyordum, gözlerim yanıyordu ve bitkindim."
"Daha önce de grip olmuştum, bu yüzden bu hissi tanıyordum. Titreme, ağrılar, yorgunluk... hepsi bir arada."
"Bir haftadır hissettiğim tüm belirtiler tekrarlanmıştı: ateş, kas ağrıları, yorgunluk, gözlerimde yanma hissi."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum. Titreyerek uyanmıştım, vücudum ağrıyordu, gözlerim yanıyordu ve çok yorgundum."
Göğüslerim hala lutealdeymişim gibi ağrıyor... ve hala duygusal lanet bir enkazım! genellikle şimdiye kadar semptomlardan rahatlama hissederdim ama neredeyse vücudumun neden henüz kanamadığım konusunda kafası karışmış gibi??
"Duygusal olarak çok çalkantılıyım ve sanki adet dönemimden önceki gibi hissediyorum, göğüslerim de ağrıyor.  Genellikle bu dönemde daha iyi hissederdim, neden hala kanamıyorum acaba?"
"Vücudum sanki adete girmemiş gibi davranıyor, göğüslerim hala hassas ve ben de çok duygusalım. Neden hala kanamıyorum?"
"Kafam çok karışık, adet olmam gerekirdi ama olmadı. Göğüslerim yine de ağrıyor ve duygusal olarak çok kırılganım."
Adet dönemimin gecikmesi beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor. Göğüslerim hala ağrıyor ve ruh halim çok kötü. Neden hala kanamıyorum?
"Vücudum çok garip davranıyor. Adetim gecikti, göğüslerim ağrıyor ve duygusal olarak çöküyorum. Anlamakta güçlük çekiyorum."
"PMDD semptomları nedeniyle hasta günlerim olduğunda ve birkaç gün boyunca gridden çıktığımda, işe geri döndüğümü ve çok yargılandığımı ve utandığımı hissediyorum ve işte olmamam hakkındaki kararlarını telafi etmek için ekstra güçlü ve kendinden emin olmam gerektiğini hissediyorum. Tekrar “Tamam” hissetmeye geri döndüğümde, kendimi kötü hissettiğimi ve hiçbir şey olmamış gibi geri döndüğüm için kendimi kötü hissettiğimi düşünebilirim."
"PMDD nedeniyle gridden çıktığımda, geri döndüğümde işe yaramıyor gibi hissediyorum, kendimi bir sürü baskı altında hissediyorum ve çok fazla telafi etmeye çalışıyorum."
"İşe geri döndüğümde sanki ben yokmuşum gibi davranıyorlar ve sanki hiç bir şey olmamış gibi devam ediyorlar, bu yüzden kendimi çok yargılanmış ve utangaç hissediyorum."
"Birkaç gün izin almak zorunda kalmak, iş arkadaşlarımın bakışlarını üzerimde hissetmeme neden oluyor, sanki ben yokmuşum gibi davranıyorlar, sanki ben yokmuşum gibi."
"Sanki işe geri döndüğümde, yokluğumun nedeni konusunda açıklama yapmak zorundaymışım gibi hissediyorum, kendimi ispatlamak zorunda gibi hissediyorum."
"Birkaç gün gridden çıktıktan sonra, işe geri döndüğümde bir şeyleri telafi etme zorunluluğu hissediyorum, sanki onlara bir şey borçluymuşum gibi."
PMDD'm olduğundan şüpheleniyorum ve bana sadece antidepresanlar ya da doğum kontrolümü değiştirmeyi teklif ediyor ama asla resmi olarak tanı koymadı.. resmi olarak teşhis edilmekten ne beklediğimden emin değilim ama sanırım dönemimde kendimden farklı davranmamın meşru bir nedeni olduğunu bilmek beni daha az delirtecekti :(
"PMDD olduğumdan şüpheleniyorum, ama doktorum bununla ilgili hiçbir şey yapmıyor. Sadece antidepresanlar veya doğum kontrolümü değiştirmeyi teklif ediyor. Beni gerçekten endişelendiren bu."
PMDD olduğunu düşünmek beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor. Dönemimde kendimi farklı hissetmemin nedeni olduğunu bilmek istiyorum.
"Doktorum PMDD teşhisi koymayı reddediyor. Bu benimle ilgili bir şey değil, sanki ben uyduruyormuşum gibi hissettiriyor."
Sanki hissettiklerim görünürde yokmuş gibi hissediyorum. Sadece 'antidepresan deneyin' demeleri gerçekten yetersiz.
Doğum kontrolü ve antidepresanlar bir çözüm değil. PMDD'nin gerçek bir tanı olduğunu ve bunun için bir çözüm olduğunu bilmek istiyorum.
"- cansız nesnelere öfkelenmek veya snapping - yaklaşan kıyamet hissi - paranoyak düşünceler - insanlar sizi almak için dışarı çıkmış gibi hissetmek - aşırı yeme, yiyecek özlemi - bozulmuş motor kontrolü, örneğin ""her zamankinden daha fazla sürüş veya park hatası yapmak"" gibi ""her zamankinden daha fazla araba kullanma ve park etme"" gibi ""her zamankinden daha fazla baş dönmesi ve günün erken saatlerinde bitkin hissetme"" - belirli seslerde yoğun sıkıntı, özellikle çiğneme ve nefes alma - Kendi kendine zarar verme dürtüleri veya hatta yoğun intihar düşünceleri - Küçük şeyler üzerinde ağlamak."
"Bu dönemde kaygı ve çöküş hissettim, her şeyin altüst olacağı bir hisle kapıldım."
"Herkes benimle uğraşıyor gibiydi, bir tuzakta olduğumu hissediyordum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyordum, arabalarımı her zamankinden daha fazla sürüyordum ve park yerlerine giremiyordum."
"Sıradan seslerden rahatsız oluyordum, özellikle çiğneme sesleri beni çileden çıkarıyordu."
"Her şey için ağlıyordum, en ufak bir şey bile beni yıkıyordu."
"pmdd üzerine bir kompozisyon yazmak zorunda kaldım... bu, kendi kızkardeşlerimiz tarafından ciddiye alınmadığımız için pmdd ve incindiğim için kendimi suçlu hissetmemi sağlıyor."
"PMDD hakkında yazdığım kompozisyon, kendi kızkardeşlerim tarafından yeterince ciddiye alınmadığım için,  benim PMDD’yi ve hissettiğim acıyı küçümsediğimi düşündüren bir durum yarattı."
"Kızkardeşlerim PMDD'yi anlamak konusunda pek istekli değiller, bu yüzden onlara  bu kompozisyonu göstermek bana kendimden utanmamı sağlıyor."
"Kızkardeşlerim, PMDD'yi  ciddiye almıyorlar, bu yüzden  bu kompozisyonu onlara gösterdiğimde  sanki kendimi suçluyormuşum gibi hissediyorum."
"Kendi kızkardeşlerim bile PMDD'yi ciddiye almıyor. Bu kompozisyonu onlara göstermek, onların gözünde beni önemsizleştirmiş gibi hissettirdi."
Bu kompozisyonu yazmak zorunda kalmak yeterince kötü. Şimdi de kızkardeşlerim tarafından yargılanıyor gibi hissediyorum ve sanki PMDD'yi  abartıyormuşum gibi hissetmemi sağlıyor.
Adetim bugün ve iki hafta içinde aynı anda sona erecek.
Adet dönemim bugün bitiyor ve önümüzdeki iki hafta içinde de tamamen sona eriyor.
Bugün adet dönemim sona eriyor ve iki hafta içinde de artık regl olmayacağım.
Adet görmem bugün bitiyor ve iki hafta içinde tamamen kesilecek.
Bu ayki adet dönemim bugün sona eriyor ve iki hafta içinde artık adet görmeyeceğim.
Adet döngüm bugün sona eriyor ve önümüzdeki iki hafta içinde de tamamen sona erecek.
Pmdd belirtilerim eb ve aya bağlı olarak akıyor. Bu sefer etrafında oldukça şiddetli hissediyorlar. Tüm gece endişeyle uyandım. Kendini sabote etme. Kendimi ikna etmek sadece gitmemeliyim. Ya da endişem sürücüde o kadar kötü olacak ki yapamayacağım. Gezide endişem o kadar kötü olacak ki panik atak geçireceğim ve her şeyi mahvedeceğim. Herkesin önünde ağlayacağım.
PMS belirtileriyle başa çıkmak gerçekten zor. Özellikle de kötü bir dönemdeyken.
Bu ay PMS belirtileri daha yoğun ve her zamankinden daha fazla mücadele ediyorum.
"Endişe, uykuyu ve işleri mahvedecek kadar kötüleşebilir. Bu sefer özellikle zor."
Kendimi bu kötü hislere kapılmamaya ikna etmeye çalışıyorum ama bazen çok zor.
Geçen sefer bir panik atak geçirmiştim ve her şeyi mahvetmekten korkuyorum. Bu sefer daha iyi olacağımı umuyorum.
"Ruh halim değişiyor, her zaman tam güçle geliyorlar ve beni en kötü depresyona ve öfkeye sokuyorlar.... Her şeyi bitirmek istiyorum, bunun geçici olduğunu bilmene rağmen, gerçekten tho mu? Bir dahaki sefere kadar geçici mi ve sonra ne? Kendimi aşağılamaya çalışmam gerekiyor mu? Hayatımın geri kalanında her ay???"
"Bu duygusal iniş çıkışlar beni tüketiyor, sanki sürekli bir savaşın içindeyim."
"Bu döngü beni yoruyor, her seferinde umutsuzluğa kapılıyorum."
"Biliyorum ki bu geçici, ama bu sefer ne kadar sürecek? Tekrar tekrar yaşamak zorunda mıyım?"
"Kendimi toparlamaya çalışmam gerekiyor, ama bu ne kadar sürecek? Hayatımın geri kalanında böyle mi hissedeceğim?"
"Bu duygulara kapıldığımda hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece her şeyi bırakıp gitmek istiyorum."
"O haşhaşlı kahverengilere sahip olmadığımı hissettiğim öfke bir şey. Hiçbir şey söylememeyi başardım, ama ruh halimin sallanma şekli yasal korkutucu."
"O anda hissettiğim öfke bir patlamaydı, her damarımdan akan ateş gibi."
"Öfkem o kadar yoğunlaştı ki, içimde bir volkan patlayacak gibiydi."
"O haşhaşlı kahverengilere sahip olmadığım için, suskunluğum bile bir tehdit gibiydi."
"Hiçbir şey söylemesem de, öfkem o kadar yoğun bir şekilde hissediliyordu ki, havada bir gerginlik vardı."
"Sustuğum için sakinmişim gibi görünüyordum, ama içimde öfkenin kasırgası dönüyordu."
"Dokuz gece boyunca sıcak sifon, migren, adet dönemim gelip geçti ve hiçbir şey işe yaramıyor."
"Her gece sıcak su torbası ve ağrı kesici ilaç kullandım, baş ağrım ve adet sancım geçti ama hiçbir şey işe yaramıyor."
Dokuz gecedir baş ağrım ve adet sancım için sıcak su torbası ve ilaç kullanıyorum ama hala kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum.
"Sıcak su torbası, ilaçlar ve dinlenmeyle baş ağrımı ve adet sancımı geçirmeye çalışıyorum ama hiçbir şey işe yaramıyor."
Gece boyunca ağrı kesici ilaç ve sıcak su torbası kullandım ama baş ağrım ve adet sancım gitmiyor.
Baş ağrısı ve adet sancısı için sürekli ilaç kullanıp sıcak su torbası uyguluyorum ama hiçbir etkisi olmuyor.
"Herkesten nefret ediyorum, dünyanın yanmasını izlemek istiyorum, hatta yarınki randevumu bile iptal edebilirim."
"Hayat beni çok yordu, artık hiçbir şey umurumda değil, dünyanın sonunu bile bekleyerek geçirebilirim."
"İnsanlara güvenimi kaybettim, herkes beni hayal kırıklığına uğrattı, en yakın arkadaşımı bile bugün kaybetmekten korkmuyorum."
"Her şey anlamsız geliyor, her gün aynı sıkıcı rutin, belki de her şeyi bırakıp kafama göre yaşamayı denemeliyim."
"Hiçbir şey umut vermiyor, her şey kötüye gidiyor, ben de bu kaosun bir parçası olmak istemiyorum."
"Kendimi bir çıkmazda hissediyorum, her şey beni bunaltıyor, belki de bu dünya için bir tehdit değilimdir."
"PMDD'nin derinliklerindeyim - dönemimden 6 gün uzakta. Lanet oyunu doğru yapamadım ve hıçkırarak ve ayrılarak sona erdi. Çok utandım ve bunu yaptığıma inanamıyorum. En büyük korkum, insanların deli olduğumu düşünmeleridir."
"PMDD'nin pençesindeyim, gerçekten de kötü hissediyorum. Bunu her ay yaşamak zorunda kalmak çok zor."
Bu dönem öncesi sendromu beni gerçekten çökertti. Her şeyi kontrolümde kaybettiğimi hissediyorum ve bunun sona ermesini istiyorum.
Bir haftadan fazla bu pisliğin içindeydim ve sanki hiçbir yere varamıyorum. Ne zaman normale döneceğimi merak ediyorum.
Bu PMS'nin beni gerçekten alt ettiğini düşünüyorum. Bu hislerle başa çıkmak için mücadele ediyorum ve kendimi gerçekten kötü hissediyorum.
Her ay bu PMDD'nin beni ele geçirmesini görmek beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor. Bu durumun kontrolünü ele geçirmek için çabalıyorum ama bunu yapmanın bir yolunu bulamıyorum.
Ona dönemim boyunca karanlık düşünceler ve şiddetli depresyonla ilgili sorunlarımı anlattım....bu benim ruh sağlığımla ilgiliydi.... Grafikteki düşüncelerimi not ettiğini bile sanmıyorum.
"Duygusal mücadelelerimden bahsettim, ancak onun ilgisini çektiğinden emin değilim."
"Duygusal durumumun ne kadar kötü olduğunu anlatmaya çalıştım, ama bunu ciddiye aldığından emin değilim."
"Ona depresyon ve karanlık düşüncelerle mücadele ettiğimi anlattım, ama sanki anlamamış gibiydi."
"Ruh halimi ve yaşadığım zorlukları anlattım, ama hiçbir şey yapacağını düşünmüyorum."
"Tüm bunları ona açtım, ama umarım sadece duymuştur."
"Her ses, doku, tat dayanılmazdır. Ağrı da öyle. DPDR. Hormon tedavisi işe başlayana kadar herhangi bir plan yapamamak / hatta düşünememek."
"Her şey o kadar yoğun, o kadar gerçek ki, nefes almak bile zorlaşıyor. Her duygu, her an dayanılmaz."
"Başım dönüyor, midem bulanıyor, her şey gerçek dışı gibi. Bu hayatı yaşayamam."
"Hiçbir şey eskisi gibi değil, her şey bulanık, her şey yanlış. Ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Bu beden bana ait değil, bu duygu bana ait değil. Bu gerçeklik bana ait değil."
"Yaşamak, hissetmek, düşünmek... hepsi bir kâbusa dönüştü. Bu beden bana ait değil, bu gerçeklik bana ait değil."
"Benim için Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Dopa Mucuna, Adderall, bazı kafein, bazı mantarlar, bazı B vitaminleri, bazı reçeteler her şeyi spiral yapar. Yardım eden şeyler somon, yumurta ve avokado gibi sağlıklı yağlardır. Magnezyum, D3 + K12, kril yağı, multivitamin, tutku çiçeği, CoQ10'u takviye eder. Yardım eden Mirena'yı da aldım."
"Sağlıklı kalmak için her türlü şeyi deniyorum, bitkisel takviyelerden reçeteli ilaçlara kadar, hatta yiyecekleri bile değiştiriyorum."
"Bazı şeylerin bana enerji verdiğini, bazı şeylerin ise bana rahatlama sağladığını fark ettim, her şeyin bir denge olması gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"Enerjimi artırmak, stresimi azaltmak ve genel sağlığımı iyileştirmek için çeşitli yollar deniyorum, bir kombinasyon bulmaya çalışıyorum."
"Yaşam tarzı değişiklikleri, takviyeler ve reçeteli ilaçlar kullanarak sağlığımı iyileştirmeye çalışıyorum, her şeyin bir kombinasyonunun işe yaradığını düşünüyorum."
"Kendimi iyi hissettirmek için birçok farklı şey deniyorum, bazen daha iyi bazı şeyleri bulmak zaman alıyor."
Adetimi ilk aldığımdan beri korkunç kramplar geçirdim (PMDD ve endometriozis var)
"Adetimi ilk aldığımdan beri sürekli olarak şiddetli ağrılar yaşıyorum, sanırım bu PMDD ve endometriozisin etkisi."
"Doğum kontrol haplarını kullanmaya başladığımdan beri kramplarım daha şiddetli hale geldi, PMDD ve endometriozis olunca hiç rahatım yok."
"Endometriozis ve PMDD'den kaynaklanan kramplar hayatımı alt üst etti, adetimi aldığım günden beri bu ağrılarla mücadele ediyorum."
"Adetimi ilk kez aldığımda kramplar dayanılmazdı, sonradan PMDD ve endometriozis teşhisi kondu, bu yüzden şaşırmıyorum."
"PMDD ve endometriozis teşhisi konduktan sonra adetim boyunca şiddetli kramplar çekiyorum, gerçekten çok zorlu bir dönemden geçiyorum."
Ruh halim gerçekten depresyondan çok motive olacak. Devam eden semptomum esas olarak anksiyete ve panik ataklar.
"Gerçekten kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum, depresyondan çok motivasyon eksikliği yaşıyorum."
Anksiyete ve panik ataklar beni gerçekten zorluyor.
"Sanki sürekli bir kaygı içindeyim, ruh halim çok düşük."
"Fiziksel olarak sağlıklı olmama rağmen, ruhsal olarak çok kötü durumdayım."
"Depresyondan çok, kaygı ve panik atakları daha ağır basıyor."
"Her ay, luteal'e girdiğim günlerin 16-18'i civarında, gerçekten korkunç olan bir ya da iki günüm var. Bir süre için noktaları PMDD'ye bile bağlamadım ama son aylarda, bu 3 günlük süre zarfında, Tanrı'ya Yemin Ederim, yumurtalarımın salındığını hissedebiliyorum ve uterusum deli gibi kramp atıyor."
"Her ay, adet dönemimden önceki 16-18 günlerde, gerçekten kötü iki gün geçiriyorum."
"Önceden bu dönemlerdeki kötü hissi PMDD'ye bağlamıyordum ama son aylarda, bu 3 günlük sürede, yumurtalıklarımın salındığını ve rahmindeki kasılmaları hissedebiliyorum."
"Adetimden önceki bu günlerde, vücudumun içinde adeta bir fırtına kopuyor."
"Her ay bu 3 gün boyunca, dayanılmaz ağrılar çekiyorum ve kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Adetimden önceki bu kötü günlerde, sanki vücudum bir savaş alanı gibi hissediyor."
Yatakta çürümek istiyorum
"Yorgunluktan bitap düştüm, sadece yatağa uzanıp dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Bugün ne yapacağım diye düşünmek bile istemiyorum, sadece yatağa girip uyumak istiyorum."
"Hiçbir yere gitmek, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece yatağımda uzanıp dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Duygusal olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum, sadece yatağa girip kendimi dış dünyadan soyutlamak istiyorum."
Günlük hayatın koşuşturmacasından uzaklaşmak ve sadece yatağımda rahatlamak istiyorum.
Kelimenin tam anlamıyla tek bir ruhla konuşmak istemiyorum? Benimle konuşan birine cevap vermek gerçekten içten acı veriyor.
"Tek bir ruhla konuşmak şöyle dursun, hiç kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum."
Benimle konuşan herkesi umursamıyorum.
Herkese karşı bir soğukluk hissediyorum.
İletişim kurmak beni gerçekten yoruyor.
"Kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum, çünkü kendimle bile anlaşamıyorum."
"Hala zayıf uykum, ruminasyon ve ağlama büyülerim var."
"Yine de gece uykumun kalitesi düşük, hep aynı şeyleri düşünüyorum ve ağlamaktan kendimi alamıyorum."
"Uyku bozukluğum, düşüncelerimin tekrar tekrar dönmesi ve ağlama nöbetlerim devam ediyor."
"Uyku sorunum, düşüncelerimin kafamda dönmesi ve ağlama ataklarım hala devam ediyor."
"Gece iyi uyuyamıyorum, düşüncelerimde takılıp kalıyorum ve sürekli ağlıyorum."
"Uyku, ruminasyon ve ağlama durumlarım hala devam ediyor, daha düzelmedi."
"Bundan nefret ediyorum, kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum!"
Bu yalnızlık beni mahvediyor.
Tek başıma olmak beni gerçekten mutsuz ediyor.
Kimseyle konuşamamak beni delirtiyor.
"Bu yalnızlık dayanılmaz, birisiyle konuşmam gerek."
Tek başıma olmak beni gerçekten kötü hissettiriyor.
"İntihara meyilli olduğum, düşünüldüğüm ve takip etmek için planlar yaptığım birçok durumda hatırlayabiliyorum ve kendime zarar verebileceğimi bildiğim şeyleri yapmama konusunda kendime güvenmemeye başladım. Bu dönemler genellikle dönemimden 1-3 hafta önce sürer ve başladıktan sonra hiçbir şey olmadığı gibi gitmekte iyiyim. Bu sefer özellikle benim için zor oldu ve depresyona eklenen başka stresli şeyler de oldu ve gerçekten kötüleşti."
"İntihara eğilimli olduğum zamanlar, bir süredir devam eden bir şey değil, daha çok belirli zamanlarda gelen ve birkaç hafta süren bir hissiyat."
"Bu zamanlarda, kendimi durdurmanın yollarını düşünmek yerine kendimi kurtarabileceğim şeyleri bulmaya odaklanıyorum."
"Bazen o kadar kötü oluyorum ki, kendime zarar vermeyi düşünürken kendime güvenemiyorum, bu yüzden durmam için güvenebileceğim başka insanlar bulmam gerekiyor."
"Son birkaç yıldır bu sorunlarla mücadele ediyorum, ancak her defasında daha iyi yönetebildiğimi düşünüyorum."
"Bu sefer özellikle zor geçti, çünkü genellikle depresyonla mücadele ediyorum ve bu sefer üstüne ek stresler de oldu."
Her şeyi uzun zamandır gömmeye çalışıyorum.
Uzun zamandır gerçekleri saklamaya çalışıyorum.
Her şeyi unutturmaya çalışıyorum.
Geçmişimi unutup devam etmeye çalışıyorum.
Bu sırları artık taşıyamam.
Bu yükü omuzlarımda taşıyamayacağım.
"Bu, bugün açık okyanusta bir can yelek gibi hissettiriyor."
"Bu, okyanusun ortasında tek bir tahta parçası gibi hissettiriyor."
Sanki bir fırtınada tek bir küçük tekne gibiyim.
"Kaybolmuş ve yalnız, çölün ortasında bir vaha bulmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Her şey çok karanlık ve korkutucu, sanki bir uçuruma doğru gidiyormuşum gibi."
"Bu, bir kum saati içindeki son kum tanesi gibi, zamanın bittiği bir his."
Ağlıyorum. Bu sözleri kalbimde hissediyorum. Sanki bu sözler ruhumdan geliyormuş gibi.
"Bu şarkı bana her şeyimi anlatıyor, sanki yıllardır sakladığım duygularımı dile getiriyormuş gibi."
"Bu şiir öyle dokunaklı ki, sanki yüreğimin derinliklerinden fısıldanıyor gibi."
"Bu filmde kendimi buldum, her sahnede kendi yaşadıklarımı görüyorum."
"O anki hislerimi tarif edemiyorum, sanki tüm varlığımla bu sözleri hissediyorum."
"Bu resimde gördüğüm yalnızlık, kendi içinde yaşadığım yalnızlığı yansıtıyor."
Son zamanlarda intiharı gerçekten hissetmek
Son zamanlarda umutsuzluk ve boşluk hissi içindeyim.
Hayatın anlamını kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum.
"Yaşamaktan bıktım, hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor."
"Her şey çok ağır geliyor, artık yükümü taşıyamıyorum."
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda değil, kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Bence pmdd, bundan muzdarip olmayan herkes için çok yalıtıcı ve anlaşılması zor bir şey ve bunu birinin KNowing'den duymak için bir şükran ve görünürlük hissettim, bunun üzerimizde tuttuğu çaresizliği ve umutsuzluğu anlıyorsunuz."
"PMDD'nin, bundan muzdarip olmayanlar için ne kadar yalnızlaştırıcı ve anlaşılmaz bir şey olduğunu gerçekten hissediyorum. KKnowning'de bunu paylaştığınız için minnettarım."
"Kendimi PMDD'nin ne kadar zor olduğunu tam olarak anlamayan insanlara anlatmakta çok zorlanıyorum, bu yüzden KKnowning'de duymak gerçekten bana umut verdi."
"Kimse PMDD'nin karanlık tarafını, bu çaresizlik ve umutsuzluk hislerini anlayamaz, KKnowning'de bunun hakkında konuşmak rahatlatıcı."
"Bu hastalığın insanlara nasıl hissettirdiğini, hissettiğimiz yalnızlığı ve umutsuzluğu, KKnowning'deki paylaşım sayesinde anlaşıldığını hissediyorum."
"PMDD'nin ne kadar çaresiz ve yalnızlaştırıcı olduğunu sadece yaşayanlar bilir, KKnowning'de bunu dile getirenlere şükranlarımı sunuyorum."
Bir tatilimi sebepsiz yere durmaksızın ağlayarak geçirdim... Beş yıldızlı uluslararası ünlü bir restodaydım ve gözyaşlarım sonsuza dek akıyordu.
Bu tatilde her şey yolunda gidiyordu ama içimde tarifi olmayan bir üzüntü vardı.
"Beş yıldızlı otelin lüks atmosferi, hayatımda yaşadığım büyük bir hayal kırıklığını bastıramadı."
Her şey mükemmeldi ama ben yine de bir sebepsiz yere üzgün ve mutsuz hissediyordum.
"O lüks restoranın içinde kendimi o kadar çaresiz hissettim ki, durmadan ağlayarak vaktimi geçirdim."
"Orada olmanın keyfini çıkarmam gerekirdi ama içimdeki üzüntü, her şeyi mahvetti."
"Kendini aşağı hissetmek, kendini dövmek, şu anda sadece kendinleyken doğru yönde hareket etmek ve doğru şey olduğuna güvenmen gereken şeyi kendine vermek"
"Kendini kötü hissettiğinde, kendine karşı sert davranma,  bu zor zamanlarda kendine güvenmen gereken şeyi ver, sadece kendine güven."
"Şu anda kendine odaklanıp doğru adımlar atmanın önemini hatırla, bu zamanlar zorlu olsa da, kendine güven."
"Kendini aşağılamadan önce, kendine karşı nazik davranmayı, kendine güvenmeyi ve şu anda doğru yolu izlemeni hatırlat."
"Kendini kötü hissettiğinde, kendine iyi bakmayı unutma, kendine güven, doğru yolda olduğunu bil."
"Bu zor zamanlarda kendine güven, doğru yolu takip et, kendine inan ve kendini aşağılama,  kendine şefkat göster."
Ben de ağlıyorum!
Ben de senin gibi üzgünüm.
Benim de içimde bir burukluk var.
Ben de aynı acıyı hissediyorum.
Benim de gözlerim doluyor.
Ben de senin gibi ağlamak istiyorum.
Kalkamıyorum.
Yorgunluktan dolayı hareket edemiyorum.
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, hareket edecek gücüm yok."
Bu halde kalkıp hareket edemem.
Fiziksel olarak kalkacak gücüm yok.
"Ayaklarımda hissizlik var, kalkamıyorum."
"'Harika bir zaman geçirmeliyim, istediğim her şeyi yapabilirim çünkü bu benim hayatım' diye düşündüğünüzde, ama yapmak istediğiniz tek şey ağlamak.

"42yrs yaşlı. Sadece histerektomi ve ooforektomi (uterus ve yumurtalıklar kaldırıldı) 2 ay önce aldım ve artık bu düşüncelere sahip değilim. Dürüst olmak gerekirse, arka görüşte PMDD düşündüğümüzden çok daha kötü."

Şu an beynim saçma sapan şeyler uyduruyor.
Son zamanlarda aklıma acayip fikirler geliyor.
Beynim bugün hayal dünyasında gezintiye çıkmış gibi.
Bir şeyler uydurmak için içgüdüsel bir istek duyuyorum.
Aklımda tamamen mantıksız bir düşünce akışı var.
"Aklıma saçma sapan fikirler geliyor, sanki birisi beynimi karıştırıyor."
Her zaman en kararsız insan gibi hissediyorum çünkü tamamen zıt düşüncelere sahip olabilirim ve çoğu zaman ikisi de o anda geçerli hissediyorlar.

Düşüncelerimin duygularımı nasıl etkilediğini çözmeye çalışıyorum.
"pencere açık düşüncelerle uyumak cehennemi anlatıyorum ve bu çok kötü ve kendimi bundan vazgeçiremiyorum, her şey sinir sistemime bağlı"
"Açık pencereden gelen düşüncelerle uyumak, yaşadığım sıkıntıları gözler önüne seriyor ve bu dayanılmaz, kendimi bu durumdan kurtaramıyorum, her şey sinir sistemimin kontrolünde gibi."

Bazen erkeklerin bir uterus hisseden ve geçen insanların derinliğini ve duygularını asla anlamayacaklarını hissediyorum ve daha iyi bir şefkat/anlayış seviyesi olup olmadığını bir kadınla çıkıp çıkmadığımı sorguluyorum.
Kadınların hissettiği şeyleri anlamakta erkeklerin yetersiz kaldığı zamanlar oluyor ve bana kendimi erkeklerden çok farklı ve anlayışlı bir kadınla daha mutlu hissedebileceğim gibi geliyor.
"Bir kadının duygularını ve empatisini yaşayabilen bir erkek hayal bile edemiyorum, bir erkeğin asla anlayamayacağı bir şey var."
Erkeklerin kadınların duygusal derinliğini ve empatisini tam olarak anlayabildiklerini düşünmüyorum ve bu bazen beni bir kadınla çıkma düşüncesine kapılıyor.
"Erkekler kadınların hissettiği duygusal yoğunluğu ve hassasiyeti gerçekten anlamıyorlar, sanki iki ayrı gezegenden geliyormuş gibi."
"Bir kadının hissettiklerini anlamak, bir erkeğin asla anlayamayacağı bir şey, belki de kadınların empatik duygularını daha iyi anlayabilen bir kadınla olmam daha doğru olur."
Rahatsız edici düşünceler en kötüsüdür. Bu ay bunun için bir süredir en kötüsü oldu.
"Rahatsız edici düşünceler canımı sıkıyor, özellikle de bu ay."
"3 pozisyona başvurdum ve geçen hafta neredeyse sebepsiz yere işimden ayrıldım. Bu hafta, gerçek dönemim, kendimi sadece beni devre dışı bırakan ve gözyaşlarına boğan korkunç kramplarla kendim gibi hissediyorum.. smh."
Son 3 pozisyonumda kendimi mutlu hissetmedim ve geçen hafta işimden ayrılmaya karar verdim.
"Birkaç iş denedim ve geçen hafta işimi bıraktım, hala neden yaptığımı anlamıyorum."
Geçen hafta işimden ayrıldım ve şimdi hayatımda ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.
Bu hafta kendimi gerçekten hasta hissediyorum ve işten ayrıldığım için çok üzgünüm.
"İşten ayrılma kararımı vermek çok zordu, ancak şuan kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum."
Zaten 300  ödedim zaman yeni bir ampul uydurmak için beni şarj hakkında 40 dakika boyunca mekanik ile Obsessively tartıştı....
"Bu ampulün değişiminin neden bu kadar pahalı olduğunu anlamıyorum, zaten 300 TL ödedim."
"Ampulü değiştirmenin maliyetine rağmen, hala zamanımın 40 dakikasını benimle şarj hakkında tartışmakla geçirdi."
"40 dakikadır ampulün değişiminin bedeli hakkında tartışıyoruz, sanki benim için hiçbir önemi yokmuş gibi."
"Şarj hakkında konuşmayı bırakabilir misiniz, zaten bu ampul için 300 TL ödedim, bir de zamanımı çalmayın."
"Bu ampulün neden 300 TL olduğunu gerçekten merak ediyorum, o kadar çok tartışma ve zaman kaybına değmez."
"Ertesi gün korkmayı düşünmeye başlıyorum. Bu mantıklıysa. 'Ah hayır, ertesi gün yakın ve o saatleri geçmek zorundayım' Bu düşüncenin kaygıyı/imparatorluk kıyametini harekete geçirdiğini düşünmek."
"Ertesi gün yaklaştıkça, bu korkunun nasıl daha da büyüyeceğinden endişeleniyorum."
"Bu mantıklıysa, o zaman yarın o kadar da kötü olmayacak. Korkularımın önüne geçmeliyim."
"Ertesi günü düşünmek, 'Ah hayır, o saatler çok yavaş geçiyor' demekten başka bir şey değil. Korkunun beni ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum."
Korkuyu uzaklaştırmak için ertesi günün geçmesini beklemek zorunda olduğumu fark ediyorum. Bunun nasıl başa çıkılabileceğini bilmiyorum.
"Ertesi günün gelmesiyle baş edebilme korkusu, beni tam anlamıyla tüketiyor."
Bunu çok hissediyorum.
Bunu gerçekten içtenlikle hissediyorum.
Bu konuda çok güçlü duygular besliyorum.
Bunu derinden yaşıyorum.
Bu bana çok dokunuyor.
Bu duyguyu çok yoğun bir şekilde deneyimliyorum.
Rahatsız edici düşünceler. Aynı listeyi yazabilirdim. Yorucu.
Zihnimde dolaşan can sıkıcı fikirler beni bitiriyor.
Aynı kelimeleri tekrar tekrar yazmak beni yordu.
Bu monotonluğu kırmak için yeni bir şeyler denemeliyim.
Bu kadar tekrar edici bir görev beni ruhsal olarak tüketiyor.
Başka bir yere odaklanmak için bu düşüncelerden kurtulmam gerek.
Sanki beynim kendine saldırmaya çalışıyor

Bence de öyle.
Aynı şeyi düşünüyor muyuz?
"Bu düşüncelerden bazıları ve vücudum menstruasyon yapmak istediğinde çok daha kötü + daha yıkıcı olan diğerleri var, PMDD'mi bitirmek için yumurtalıkların düzenli olarak çıkarılmasını düşünüyorum."

"Birçok doktora gittim, ilaçlar denedim ama PMDD'nin şiddeti hayatımı mahvediyor."
PMDD ile mücadele eden birçok kadın olduğunu biliyorum ve bunun bir çözümü olmalı. Bu düşünceleri tamamen ortadan kaldıracak bir şey bulmalıyım.

Kendimi itiraf etmek zorundayım.
Kendimi itiraf etmeden edemiyorum.
Bu durumu itiraf etmeliyim.

kararsız ama ayın farklı zamanlarında... ya da döngülerimizi senkronize ederdik ve her ikisi de cehennemde olurdu.
"Bu konuda kararsızım ama belki de planlarımızı ayın farklı evrelerine göre ayarlayabiliriz, ya da tamamen senkronize bir şekilde hareket eder ve ikimiz de berbat oluruz."

DEHB'ye sahip olduğumdan asla şüphelenmedim ama Aman Tanrım! Listelediğin belirtiler çok göreceli ve hala DEHB'ye sahip olabileceğim gerçeğinin etrafında kafamı saramıyorum...

"Sezgisel olarak ve yıllarca süren araştırmalardan DEHB ve muhtemelen ASD'ye sahip olduğumu biliyorum. Altı yaşından beri maskelendiğimin farkındayım ya da bunun hakkında. Mücadelelerim her zaman yoğundu. En büyük ipuçlarından biri, her zamanki semptomlarımın PMDD tarafından ne kadar güçlü bir şekilde şiddetlendiğiydi."
Yıllarca süren kendi gözlemlerim ve araştırmalarım sonucunda DEHB ve muhtemelen Otizm Spektrum Bozukluğu (ASD) yaşadığıma inanıyorum.
DEHB ve ASD belirtilerinin çocukluğumdan beri hayatımı etkilediğini hissediyorum ancak uzun yıllar boyunca bu konuda farkında değildim.
Özellikle PMDD dönemlerinde DEHB belirtilerimin şiddetlenmesi beni bu konuda daha fazla düşünmeye itti.
Bir süredir mücadele ettiğim belirtilerin DEHB ve ASD'den kaynaklanabileceği düşüncesine kapılıyorum.
Uzun zamandır farkında olmasam da yaşadığım zorlukların kökeninde DEHB ve ASD olabileceğine inanıyorum.
Ergenlik döneminde babam tarafından teröre uğruyordum. Bazen PMDD'nin endokrin sistem travması tepkim olup olmadığını merak ediyorum.
"Ergenlik yıllarım babamın davranışları nedeniyle oldukça zor geçti, bazen yaşadığım ruhsal iniş çıkışların babamın davranışlarının bir sonucu olup olmadığını düşünüyorum."
"Babamın davranışları benim için travmatikti, özellikle ergenlik döneminde. Bazen PMDD'nin sadece bedenimdeki travmanın bir yansıması olup olmadığını merak ediyorum."
"Ergenlik döneminde yaşadığım zorluklar, babamın davranışlarının travmatik etkisiyle şekillendi. Bugün yaşadığım ruhsal sorunların bu travmanın bir sonucu olup olmadığını düşünüyorum."
"Babamın bana karşı olan davranışları o zamanlar benim için çok zorlayıcıydı. Şimdi, PMDD'nin o dönemdeki travmanın bir yansıması olup olmadığını düşünüyorum."
"O dönemde babamdan sürekli bir korku ve endişe duyuyordum, bugün PMDD'nin yaşadığım travmanın bir sonucu olup olmadığını düşünüyorum."
"Bir süredir spektrumda olduğumdan şüphelendim, ancak burada teşhis koymak pahalı ve uzun bir süreç. Sanırım sorum şu - herhangi bir şeyi değiştirir mi?"
"Uzun zamandır kendimi farklı hissediyorum, bir uzman tarafından değerlendirilmem gerektiğini düşünüyorum, ancak bu süreç hem maliyetli hem de uzun sürüyor. Kendimi daha iyi hissetmemi sağlayacak mı?"
Spektrumda olduğumu düşünüyorum ama teşhis koydurmak için yeterli kaynak yok.  Bu sorunu çözmek için neler yapabilirim?
"Bazı farklılıklar yaşadığımı hissediyorum ve bu farklılıkların kaynağını öğrenmek istiyorum, ancak bir uzmana görünmek pahalı ve uzun zaman alıyor. Bu teşhisin bana faydası olur mu?"
Kendimi normalden farklı hissediyorum ama bu farklılığın nedenini öğrenmek çok zor ve masraflı. Bu durumu düzeltmek mümkün mü?
"Bir süredir kendimi farklı hissediyorum ve bunun nedenini öğrenmek istiyorum, ancak uzmanlar tarafından teşhis edilmek pahalı ve uzun sürüyor. Bu durumu düzeltmek için bir yol var mı?"
Yaşamaktan yoruldum Bazen hissediyorum
"Hayat beni çok yordu, bazen devam etmek istemediğimi hissediyorum."
"Yorgunluğumun sebebi sadece yaşamak, bazen bunalıyorum."
"Yaşamaktan bıktım, hissettiğim şey sadece yorgunluk."
"Sanki hayat beni tüketiyor, yaşamak artık benim için bir yük."
"Yaşamanın zorluklarından bıktım, bazen sadece bırakmak istiyorum."
"Son bir haftayı inanılmaz derecede depresyonda geçirdim hiçbir şey yapamadım dönemim, depresyonum ve el ele yürümem."
"Geçtiğimiz hafta boyunca gerçekten çok kötü hissettim, hiçbir şey yapmak için enerjim yoktu."
"Son bir hafta depresyonun pençesinde kıvrandım, yapacak gücüm kalmadı."
"Duygusal olarak çok kötü bir dönemden geçiyorum, bir türlü kendime gelemiyorum."
"Depresyonum beni tamamen ele geçirdi, hiçbir şey yapmak için kendimi motive edemiyorum."
"Duygusal olarak çok zorlu bir süreçten geçiyorum, kendimi toparlayamıyorum."
"Bu gönderiyi, her şeyi okumadan ilgili bilgileri aramak için atladınız ve bunu çok sık yapıyorsunuz."
"Bu makalenin tamamını okumadan sonuca atlamaya bayılıyorsun, her seferinde yapıyorsun."
"Her zaman her şeyi okumadan özetlemeye çalışıyorsun, bunu gerçekten bırakmalısın."
"Bütün metni okumadan direkt cevabı bulmaya çalışıyorsun, böylece önemli ayrıntıları kaçırabilirsin."
"Tekrar söylüyorum, lütfen tüm yazıyı okumadan sonuca atlama, bu çok sık oluyor."
"Bu raporu okumanın en iyi yolu, baştan sona okumaktır, ancak her zaman sadece sonuca odaklanıyorsun."
"Adhd teşhisim var...semptomlar, c-ptsd ile sonuçlanan bir dizi travmatik olayla şiddetlendi. Aynı zamanda pmdd semptomlarım çok daha kötüleşti."
"Adhd'nin etkileri, yaşadığım travmatik olaylar nedeniyle artmış durumda."
"Geçmişteki travmalar, adhd ve pmdd semptomlarımı daha da ağırlaştırdı."
"Travmatik deneyimlerim, adhd ve pmdd'nin getirdiği zorlukları artırdı."
"C-ptsd teşhisi, adhd ve pmdd semptomlarımı şiddetlendirdi."
Yaşadığım travmatik olayların adhd ve pmdd'ye olan etkisi çok belirgin.
PMDD ve DEHB teşhisi kondu ve tüm yıllarımın endişe ve OKB tanılarının aslında yanlış olduğundan eminim.
"Tüm bu yıllar boyunca, DEHB ve OKB teşhislerinin yanlış olduğunu ve aslında PMDD ile mücadele ettiğimi fark ettim."
İşte yıllardır devam eden kaygı ve obsesif kompulsif bozukluk tanılarımın aslında PMDD'nin semptomları olduğunu keşfettim.
"Uzun yıllar süren yanlış tanıların ardından, sonunda doğru teşhisi, yani PMDD ve DEHB'yi aldım."
"Her zaman endişeli ve takıntılı olduğumu düşünüyordum, ancak şimdi bunların aslında PMDD'nin belirtileri olduğunu anlıyorum."
"Yıllarca yanlış teşhislerle mücadele ettim, ancak şimdi nihayet doğru teşhis olan PMDD ve DEHB ile tanıştım."
"Otizm belirtileri, adet dönemimi geçirmek üzereyken çok daha kötü hale geliyor"
Adet dönemimden önceki günlerde otizm belirtilerim çok daha belirginleşiyor.
"Otizmim, adet döngümün belirli aşamalarında çok daha zorlayıcı hale geliyor."
"Adet dönemim yaklaşırken, otizm belirtilerimle başa çıkmak daha da zorlaşıyor."
"Adet döngümdeki hormonal değişimler, otizm belirtilerimi şiddetlendiriyor."
Adet dönemimi geçirmek üzereyken otizm belirtilerimde önemli bir artış hissediyorum.
Bunun benim için ne anlama geldiği ve bu konuda ne yapabileceğim konusunda o kadar şaşkınım ve kafam karıştı ki. Benim için bu kadar çok şeyin neden bu kadar zor olduğuyla ilgili cevaplar arıyordum.
"Bu durumun bana ne ifade ettiğini ve nasıl bir yol izlemem gerektiğini gerçekten anlamıyorum, oldukça bunalmış ve kafam karışık."
"Bu olayların benim üzerimde yarattığı etkiyi ve ne yapmam gerektiğini bilmiyorum, kendimi çok kaybolmuş hissediyorum."
Her şeyin bu kadar zor olmasının sebeplerini çözmeye çalışırken kendimi tamamen şaşkın ve çaresiz hissediyorum.
Bu durumun bana ne anlam ifade ettiğini ve ne yapmam gerektiğini düşünürken içimde bir kaos var.
Her şeyin bir anda bu kadar karmaşık hale gelmesi beni gerçekten korkutuyor ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.
"Stresli ev hanımı tedavisi ve kaygı için 10 mg leksapro aldım, DEHB'ye sahip olma konseptimi 'yeniden ziyaret etmeden' önce. Bu çok kötü değildi. Yin yoga, kalça / omuz / boyun / spin germe, tibetan kaseleri / lofi / şifalı müzik / piano, görünüşte standart insandan daha fazla hayvansal protein gerektiriyorsa, sıcak banyolar, bana ve evime güzel kokular veriyor, magnezyum."
"Ev hanımı stresiyle başa çıkmak için ilaç kullandım ama bu ilaçlar sadece geçici bir çözüm gibiydi, aslında kendimi daha iyi hissetmek için yaşam tarzımı değiştirmem gerektiğini anladım."
"Sıradan insanların yapamayacağı pek çok şeyi yapmaya çalıştım, ama sonunda fark ettim ki sadece kendime ve vücuduma iyi bakmam gerektiğini."
"Yoğun bir ev hanımı hayatı yaşarken, kendimi kaybettiğimi hissetmeye başladım.  Bu yüzden kendime daha iyi bakmaya karar verdim, kendimi yeniden keşfetmeye çalıştım ve daha doğal yollarla stresi yönetmeye odaklandım."
"Sağlıklı bir yaşam tarzı için kendimi değiştirmeye çalışıyorum,  sağlıklı beslenmeye, yoga yapmaya ve meditasyona odaklanıyorum.  Zaman zaman zorlayıcı olsa da, kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum."
Günlük hayatın stresleri ile başa çıkmak için pek çok farklı yöntem denedim.  Sonunda anladım ki kendimi dinlemeyi ve  iyiliğimi önceliklendirmeyi öğrenmem gerekiyor.
Şüphelerim vardı ama şimdi DEHB'yi çürütmek zor.
DEHB tanısıyla ilgili şüphelerim vardı ama şimdi bu teşhisin doğru olduğuna ikna oldum.

DEHB olup olmadığım konusunda şüphelerim vardı ama artık bu teşhisin beni iyi tanımladığını düşünüyorum.

DEHB ve PMDD var ve şu anda köpekbalığı haftası. İlaçlarım hiç çalışmıyor ve son birkaç gündür tam bir çöp gibi hissediyorum.
"DEHB ve PMDD ile başa çıkmak gerçekten zor, özellikle de bu hafta köpekbalığı haftası olduğunda ve ilaçlarım işe yaramadığında."
"Sanki her şey üst üste geliyor, DEHB ve PMDD semptomları, köpekbalığı haftası stressi ve ilaçların işe yaramaması..."
"Kendimi son derece yorgun ve motivasyonsuz hissediyorum, DEHB, PMDD ve köpekbalığı haftasının stresi beni tamamen tüketmiş durumda."
"Bir de bu köpekbalığı haftası stresini ekleyince DEHB ve PMDD semptomları daha da kötüleşti, ilaçlarım da hiç yardımcı olmuyor."
"Son birkaç gündür kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, ilaçlar işe yaramıyor, DEHB ve PMDD semptomları çok yoğun ve köpekbalığı haftası da cabası."
Yaklaşık 12 yaşımdan beri defalarca adhd teşhisi kondum... ve internette gördüğüm tüm kriterlerle ve bu davranışların tümünü önceden ya adhd'ye bağladım ya da sadece kişiliğimin bir parçası olduğunu varsaydım ve tamamen başka bir şey.
"Uzun zamandır, neredeyse çocukluğumdan beri, adhd teşhisiyle karşı karşıya kaldım, ama bu belirtileri her zaman ya kendi kişiliğimin bir parçası olarak kabul ettim ya da internette gördüğüm adhd kriterleriyle açıkladım."
"12 yaşımdan beri adhd teşhisiyle uğraşıyorum ve bu belirtileri hep kendi kişiliğimin bir parçası olarak görüyordum, internette gördüğüm kriterlere bakınca da bunların adhd'ye işaret ettiğini düşündüm."

"Çocukluğumdan beri adhd teşhisiyle karşılaşıyorum, internette gördüğüm kriterler ve kendi davranışlarım arasında sürekli bir örtüşme olduğunu düşünüyorum."
Otizmimin yanında DEHB olabilir... pmdd haftalarında çalışma yeteneğini kaybederim
"Otizmimle birlikte DEHB de olabilir, ayrıca PMDD'li olduğum haftalarda işlevselliğim çok kötü etkileniyor."
"Otizmle mücadele ederken DEHB de var gibi, üstüne bir de PMDD haftaları geliyor, o zaman çalışamadığım oluyor."
"Otizm ve DEHB'nin yanı sıra PMDD de var, özellikle o haftalarda çalışmam imkansız."
"Sadece otizmle uğraşmıyorum, DEHB de var, bir de PMDD haftaları oluyor, o zaman çalışmak çok zor."
"Otizmim var, DEHB de olabilir, bir de PMDD haftaları geliyor, o zaman ne yapacağımı bilemiyorum."
"İlaçlarımın sürekli olarak luteal fazda çalışmadığını fark ettiğimde DEHB'mi teşhis ettirdim, sonra PMDD'den şüphelendim."
Sürekli olarak luteal fazda ilaçlarımın işe yaramadığını fark ettiğimde DEHB'mi teşhis ettirdim ve sonra PMDD olasılığını da araştırdım.
"İlaçlarım luteal fazda etkisiz olduğunda DEHB'mi teşhis ettirdim, daha sonra PMDD'den şüphelenmeye başladım."
"İlaçlarımın luteal fazda etkili olmaması DEHB teşhisimi sağladı, sonra da PMDD olasılığını düşünmeye başladım."
"Luteal fazda ilaçlarımın işe yaramaması DEHB'mi teşhis etmemi sağladı, ardından da PMDD olasılığı aklıma geldi."
İlaçlarımı kullandığım halde luteal fazda etkili olmadıklarını fark edince DEHB teşhisi aldım ve daha sonra PMDD'den şüphelendim.
"Neden bu kadar acayip olduğumu bilmeden geçen onca yıldan sonra, bir bakıma (muhtemelen) bir cevaba sahip olmak güzel hissettiriyor... Onu içselleştirdim... Sadece hayatı çok daha zorlaştırıyor, özellikle işte veya ilişkilerde başarılı olmak, temelde tüm yaşam."
"Benim farklılığımın kökenlerini anlamanın, bir anlamda, yıllardır taşıdığım gizemli bir yükten kurtulmamı sağladı. Ama bu aydınlanma aynı zamanda bazı zorluklar da beraberinde getirdi."
"Her zaman neden bu kadar farklı olduğumu merak ettim ve nihayet bir cevap bulmak bir bakıma rahatlatıcı oldu. Fakat bu cevap, hayatın bazı yönlerini, özellikle de iş ve ilişkileri, beklenmedik bir şekilde zorlaştırdı."
"Özgünlüğümün kaynağını anlamak, hayatımda uzun süredir cevap aradığım bir soruya yanıt bulmam anlamına geldi. Ama bu, hayatın her alanında, özellikle kariyerimde ve ilişkilerimde, bazı yeni engellerle karşılaşmamı da beraberinde getirdi."
"Uzun yıllardır farklılığımı sorguluyordum ve nihayet bir cevap bulmak, geçmişin yükünden kurtulmamı sağladı. Ancak bu cevap, hayatın bazı alanlarında, özellikle iş ve ilişkilerde, yeni zorluklarla karşılaşmamı da beraberinde getirdi."
"Yıllarca kendimden farklı olma sebebimi anlamaya çalıştım ve sonunda bu cevabı bulduğumda bir rahatlama hissettim. Fakat bu gerçek, hayatın bazı yönlerini, özellikle de kariyerimi ve ilişkilerimi, çok daha zorlaştırıyor gibi görünüyor."
luteal faz sırasında duyusal aşırı yük
"Adet döngüsünün luteal fazında, duyusal uyarımlar beni aşırı yükleyebiliyor."

"Duyusal girdiler, adet döngüsünün luteal fazında çok rahatsız edici olabiliyor."
"Bu dönemde, her şey sanki daha parlak, daha gürültülü ve daha yoğun hissediliyor."
"Luteal fazda, çevremden gelen duyusal bilgilerle başa çıkmakta zorlanıyorum."
"Adhd'im var ama hiç ilaç tedavisi almadım. Ayrıca asd'ım var. 19 'da PMDD'm olduğunu fark ettim, çünkü annemde vardı ve semptomları tanıdı."
Benim de PMDD olduğunu biliyorum ama ilaç kullanmak istemiyorum.
Asperger'ımın da etkisi olabileceğini düşünüyorum ama emin değilim.
Genellikle stresli olduğumda semptomlar daha da kötüleşiyor.
"Aslında her ay düzenli olarak, adet dönemimde çok zorlanıyorum."
Psikiyatristin verdiği ilaçlar beni hiç rahatlatmıyor.
"Aslında o zamanlar büyük bir travma geçirdiğim için dissosiyatif bölümler geçiriyordum. Düpedüz soğuk bir sürtük olabilirim çünkü duygularımı birçok şey için kapatmayı seçebileceğimi hissediyorum. Süper ışığa duyarlıyım, özellikle mavi ışığa, özellikle luteal fazım sırasında. Yiyeceklerimin çoğu dokuya dayalıdır ve şüphe halinde her seferinde aynı şekilde donmuş burrit yerim."
"Travma sonrası stres bozukluğu yüzünden bazen aşırı derecede hassas olabiliyorum, özellikle de luteal fazım sırasında."
"Çoğu zaman, özellikle yoğun stres altında olduğumda, duygusal olarak uzaklaşabiliyorum."
Kendimi korumak için duygularımı kapatmayı tercih ettiğim zamanlar oluyor.
"Duygusal olarak aşırı yüklendiğimde, her şeyden önce uzaklaşmayı tercih ederim."
"Bazı zamanlar, duygusal olarak çok hassas olduğum için, kendimi gerçeklikten koparmış gibi hissediyorum."
DEHB tedavisi almak için doktorlara gitmek için kendimi alamadım
"DEHB ile başa çıkmak gerçekten zor, ilaç almayı düşündüm ama doktora gitmeye cesaretim olmadı."
DEHB ile ilgili sorunlarım var ve tedaviye ihtiyacım olduğunu biliyorum ama bir türlü doktora gitmeye karar veremiyorum.
"DEHB ile başa çıkmak çok zor, doktorlara gitmeyi düşünüyorum ama bir türlü kendimi motive edemiyorum."
İlaç almak zorunda olduğumu biliyorum ama doktorlara gitmek konusunda tereddüt ediyorum.
DEHB teşhisimi aldıktan sonra doktorlardan yardım almak istedim ama gitmek için kendimi bir türlü motive edemedim.
DEHB'm var ve semptomlarım kesinlikle bu zamanda daha da kötüleşiyor.
"DEHB'nin etkisi bu aralar gerçekten arttı, zorlanıyorum."

"Adhd'nin en belirgin belirtisi, sürekli bir uyarılma ve heyecan ihtiyacı hissetmemdir."
"Sürekli yeni şeyler öğrenmek, aktif olmak, yeni deneyimler yaşamak, benim için çok önemli, bu da Adhd'nin bir işareti olabilir."
Bu can sıkıntısı duygusunu yenmek için sürekli bir uyarılmaya ihtiyacım var ve bu da benim Adhd'li olduğumu gösteriyor.

"DEHB ve PMDD'nin birleşik etkilerini göz önünde bulundurarak, ilaç tedavisi dikkatlice planlanmalı ve hormon hassasiyeti dikkate alınmalıdır."

Yaşadığım zorluklar için bir açıklama bulmaya çalışıyorum. Belki de durumumdan ASD de sorumlu olabilir.

"Şimdiye kadar, sadece ADHD ve PMDD'den muzdarip olduğumu düşünüyordum, ancak bu yazı ASD ihtimalini de aklıma getirdi."

"Geçen yıl PMDD teşhisi konduktan sonra, doktorum ASD'den de şüphelendiğini söyledi ve birkaç ay önce testler sonucunda ASD teşhisi konuldu."
"Bazı şeylerin yolunda olmadığını hissediyordum ama bunların nedenleri hakkında hiçbir fikrim yoktu, ta ki PMDD ve ASD teşhisleri konana kadar."
"Şimdi hem PMDD hem de ASD ile mücadele ediyorum, ancak bu teşhisler sayesinde nihayet yaşadığım zorlukları anlamak için bir çerçevem var."
Önce pmdd teşhisi kondu. O zamandan beri 2 yıl sonra DEHB ve bundan bir yıl sonra ASD teşhisi kondu.
"Önce depresyon teşhisi kondu, daha sonra anksiyete ve bunun ardından uyku bozukluğu teşhisi kondu."

DEHB ilaçları işe yaramazdı ve ilk birkaç haftanın plasebo etkisi olduğunu düşünerek panikledim.
DEHB ilaçlarının hiçbir etkisi olmadığını görünce hayal kırıklığına uğradım ve ilk haftalarda hiçbir şey hissetmemin nedeni plasebo etkisi olduğunu düşünmekten kendimi alamadım.
İlaçları almaya başladığımdan beri hiçbir değişiklik hissetmediğim için çok üzüldüm ve acaba sadece kendimi kandırdığımı mı düşünüyorum diye endişelenmeye başladım.
"İlaçlar işe yaramazsa ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, ilk haftalarda yaşadığım olumlu etkilerin sadece kendimi kandırdığımın sonucu olduğunu düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum."

Adderall moment: Birisi DEHB tanısı konduktan sonra ilk kez adderall aldığında ve aniden hayatın ne kadar iyi olduğu nedeniyle gözyaşları içinde sona erdiğinde.
DEHB ilaçları için reçetesini ilk aldığımda ve tüm zamanlarımı gerçekten yönetebileceğim gibi hissettiğimde nasıl ağladığımı hatırlayabiliyorum.
İlk kez Ritalin kullandıktan sonra bir saat boyunca odama oturdum ve ne kadar odaklanabildiğime inanamadım.
Ebeveynlerime ADHD için ilaç almamı istememi yıllarca reddettim ve şimdi sonunda kullanmaya başladıktan sonra nihayet doğru yolda olduğumu hissediyorum.
İlk kez Adderall aldığımda kendimi harika hissettim ve bu kadar üretken olduğuma inanamadım.
DEHB'nin ilaç almadan önce hayatımı ne kadar etkilediğini fark etmemiştim.
"Resmi bir teşhis almak, kalıcı depresif bozukluğum, anksiyetem ve benlik imajım konusunda bana gerçekten yardımcı oldu. Eğer yeterince kötü hissediyorsanız ve şu anda kendinizi daha iyi hissetmek için her şeyi yapabileceğinizi fark ederseniz, o zaman bir tanı testi yaptırırdım."
"Profesyonel bir değerlendirme almak, benim için gerçekten faydalı oldu çünkü duygusal sorunlarımı anlamlandırdı ve bunlarla başa çıkma yolları belirlememe yardımcı oldu."
"Bir uzmana görünmek, hayatımı gerçekten değiştirdi çünkü beni gerçekte neler yaşadığımı anlamaya yönlendirdi ve bana doğru destekleri sunabilecek kaynaklar gösterdi."
"Eğer duygusal olarak kötü hissediyorsanız ve durumun kendi kendine düzelmeyeceği hissine kapılıyorsanız, teşhis ve tedavi için bir uzmana başvurmak gerçekten yardımcı olabilir."
"Kendimi yorgun, üzgün ve değersiz hissediyordum ve bir terapistle görüştükten sonra nihayet bu hislerin kökenini anladım ve başa çıkma stratejileri öğrendim."
"Benim için en önemli şey, başkalarıyla konuşabileceğim ve benim gibi hissettiğini anlayabileceğim bir yer bulmaktı. Bir terapistin bana sağladığı bu güvenli alan, iyileşmem için çok önemliydi."
"DEHB için en azından ben çoğunlukla dopamin ile ilgili olduğunu düşünüyorum, hangi zaten disregüle ve östrojen değişiklikleri ile daha da kötüleşir. ASD için ben daha fazla aşırı uyarım ve depresyon belirtileri daha kötü hale getirir düşünüyorum."
"DEHB ile ilgili olarak, dopaminin önemli bir rol oynadığını düşünüyorum, ki bu zaten düzensiz ve östrojen değişiklikleri ile daha da kötüleşebiliyor."
"Benim görüşüme göre DEHB, dopaminin düzensizliğinden kaynaklanıyor, özellikle östrojen seviyelerindeki değişiklikler bu durumu daha da kötüleştirebiliyor."
"DEHB'nin dopamin dengesizliği ile bağlantılı olduğuna inanıyorum, bu durum zaten mevcut olan dengesizliği artırabiliyor, özellikle östrojendeki dalgalanmalar."
"DEHB ile ilgili olarak, dopaminin dengesizliği önemli bir faktör ve bu durum, özellikle östrojen seviyelerindeki değişiklikler nedeniyle daha da kötüleşebiliyor."
DEHB'nin temel nedenlerinden birinin dopamin dengesizliği olduğuna inanıyorum ve bu durum östrojen dalgalanmaları ile daha da kötüleşebiliyor.
"DEHB'ye sahip olduğumu bilmiyordum, ancak yaklaşık 9 veya 10'dan beri otistik özelliklerin ve maskelemenin farkındaydım. Muhtemelen okula girdiğim zamandan veya daha önce maskeleme. Ergenlik çağına girdiğim anda DEHB o kadar sert vurdu ki, düz bir A öğrencisi olmaktan derslerimin yarısında başarısız olmaya geçtim."
Otistik özelliklerin farkında olmadan önce DEHB'nin hayatımı nasıl etkilediğini hiç düşünmemiştim.
"Maskelemenin beni ne kadar yorduğunu fark etmemiştim, sanırım DEHB beni zorlamaya başladı."
DEHB ile mücadele etmenin otistik özelliklerimin farkında olmakla nasıl bağlantılı olduğunu henüz anlayamıyorum.
Ergenliğe girince DEHB'nin bana olan etkisi daha da belirginleşti ve maskelemenin bir daha işe yaramadığını fark ettim.
Eğitim hayatımda DEHB'nin ve otistik özelliklerin nasıl bir rol oynadığını anlamak benim için zorlu bir süreçti.
DEHB ve ASD'ye sahip olmak inanılmaz derecede sinir bozucu. ASD teşhisi ile uğraşmayacağım ama çocukluğumdan beri biliyorum.
DEHB ve ASD ile yaşamak gerçekten zor. Her zaman kendimle mücadele ettim.
"Bu durumlarla başa çıkmak çok yorucu, kendimi bazen çok yalnız hissediyorum."
"İnsanlar bu durumları anlamakta zorlanıyor, bu da benim için çok üzücü."
"Hayatımda birçok zorluk yaşadım, ancak DEHB ve ASD'nin etkilerini her zaman hissediyorum."
Bu durumlar benim kim olduğumu etkiledi ve bazen kendimi kabul etmekte zorlanıyorum.
"Her ikisini de söylüyorum ama tanısal olarak tüm AvPD kutularını kontrol ediyorum. Antidepresanlarım gerçekten uzun bir dönem geçiriyor gibi görünmüyor ve asla büyük olayları iyi havalandırmıyorlar. Adderall'dan nefret ediyorum, endişemi çok daha kötü hale getiriyor, kalbimin göğsümden patlamak istediği gibi ve sinir bozucu bir şey."
İlaçlarımı kullanıyorum ama yine de sosyal fobimle mücadele ediyorum.
Antidepresanlarımı alıyorum ama yine de uzun süreli üzüntü ve sıkıntı yaşıyorum. Büyük olayları asla atlatamıyorum.
"Adderall'dan nefret ediyorum, beni daha da endişeli yapıyor. Kalbim göğsümden fırlayacakmış gibi hissediyorum."
"İlaçlarımın sosyal fobim için yeterli olduğunu düşünmüyorum, çünkü hala çok fazla kaygı ve endişe yaşıyorum."
Antidepresanlarımı alıyorum ama yine de duygularımı yönetmekte zorlanıyorum. Özellikle büyük olaylarla başa çıkmakta sorun yaşıyorum.
"14-28. günlerde ciddi şekilde depresyona giriyorum. Sadece dört gün geçmesine rağmen kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum. Hormon seviyelerimde, adet dönemime kadar geçen günlerde neden bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi veya doğal olarak nasıl olduğumu açıklayan bir sorun olup olmadığını merak ediyorum."
"Adet döngümün belirli bir zamanında her zaman duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşıyorum, bu yüzden kendimi daha iyi hissetmeye başladığım için rahatladım."
"Bu hormon dalgalanmaları gerçekten hayatımı zorlaştırıyor, adet dönemime doğru her şey berbatlaşıyor."
"Bu dönemde kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum, bu yüzden neden olduğunu bilmek istiyorum, belki bir çözüm var."
"Bu belirli zamanlarda neden bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi anlamak için doktoruma gitmeli miyim, merak ediyorum."
"Hormonal dengesizliklerin bu kadar büyük bir etkiye sahip olması inanılmaz, bu günlerde gerçekten çok yorgun hissediyorum."
"Uyuyamıyorum, her şeyi aşırı yiyorum, kendimden nefret ediyorum ve bir kaybeden gibi hissediyorum, her şeyi kişisel olarak alıyorum ve dünyaya kızgınım."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor gibi görünüyor."
"Sürekli endişeleniyorum ve hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum, her şey çok zor."
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor, yeterince iyi olamıyorum gibi hissediyorum."
Her şey bana karşıymış gibi hissediyorum ve kimse beni anlamıyor.
Her şeyi çok fazla kafaya takıyorum ve sürekli kendimi cezalandırıyorum.
Yalnız hissediyorum. Üzgünüm. Depresyondayım. Korkuyorum. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla birine zarar verebileceğimi ve bunu yapmanın harika hissettireceğini hissediyorum.
"Kendimi kötü hissediyorum, her şey beni aşırı derecede etkiliyor."
Hayatımın kontrolünü kaybettiğimi hissediyorum ve bunu değiştirmek için hiçbir çabam işe yaramıyor.
Sanki her şey bana karşıymış gibi hissediyorum ve bu durumla başa çıkmak için kendimi yetersiz hissediyorum.
"Her şey anlamsız geliyor, sanki hayatın bir amacı yokmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Kendimi yalnız ve çaresiz hissediyorum, sanki kimse beni anlamıyormuş gibi."
İskeletimin vücudumda çok sıkı olduğunu hissediyorum ve cildimi bir insan portakalı gibi soymak istiyorum... gerçekten kendimi et hapishanemden çıkarmak istiyorum.
"Vücudumun içinde sıkışıp kaldığımı hissediyorum, sanki bir zırha sıkışmış gibi."
"Kendimi bu bedenin içinde hapsedilmiş gibi hissediyorum, özgürleşmek istiyorum."
"Derim, kemiklerim, her şey beni bağlayan bir hapishane gibi hissettiriyor."
"Sanki kendi bedenimde değilmişim gibi, dışarı çıkmak için çabalıyorum."
"Bu vücut beni esir almış, özgürlüğe hasret duyuyorum."
"Menstruasyondan 1-2 hafta önce ciddi bir şekilde uyuşmuş olacağım ve bundan 1-2 hafta sonra biraz daha iyi olacağım. Ve uyuştuğumda, intihar düşüncem var, hayatımdan vazgeçmek istiyorum, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum."
"Menstruasyon öncesi haftalar gerçekten zorlu geçiyor, uyuşukluk hissiyle baş edemiyorum."
"Adetimden önceki dönemde ruh halim çok kötü, sanki hayatın tadını çıkaramıyorum."
"Bu dönemde sanki vücudum beni terk ediyor, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Uyuşukluk o kadar yoğun ki, hayattan zevk alamıyorum, hatta intihar düşünceleri bile geliyor."
"Menstruasyon öncesi sendromu gerçekten hayatımı etkiliyor, umutsuzluğa kapılıyorum."
"Rahatsız edici düşünceler su basmaya başlar, beni etrafımda olmaya dayanamayacaklarına ikna eder. Tüm eylemlerimin onları incittiğini ya da rahatsız ettiğini ya da arkadaşım olduklarını sorgulamalarına neden olduğunu. Kötüleştiğinde gerçekten çıldırıyormuş gibi hissediyorum ve sadece bir dolapta saklanmak ve asla dışarı çıkmamak istiyorum."
"Duygularım beni ele geçiriyor, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, herkesin benden nefret ettiğine inanıyorum."
"Herkesin beni yargıladığını hissediyorum, bu yüzden kendimi gizlemek, görünmez olmak istiyorum."
"Eylemlerimle insanları incittiğimi düşünüyorum, bu yüzden onlarla iletişim kurmaktan korkuyorum."
"Kendimden tiksiniyorum, kendim olmaktan bıktım, bu yüzden sadece ortadan kaybolmak istiyorum."
"Düşüncelerim beni tüketiyor, beni etrafımda olan her şeyden uzaklaştırıyor, yalnız kalmak istiyorum."
"Hayatımın çoğunu iki haftalık bir programda geçirdim. luteal sırasında aşırı gündüz uykululuk yaşıyorum, bu beni çok uygunsuz zamanlarda uykuya daldırıyor. Orta şiddetli karmaşık uyku apnesi teşhisi kondu."
"Uyku düzenim gerçekten berbat, luteal fazımda çok fazla uykuya dalıyorum ve bu da sürekli olarak gün içinde uyuyakalıp uyanmama neden oluyor."
Son zamanlarda uyku apnesi teşhisi konuldu ve bu da luteal fazda yaşanan aşırı gündüz uykululuğunun nedeni olabilir.
"Hormonal değişikliklerin uyku düzenim üzerinde büyük bir etkisi var, özellikle luteal fazda gün içinde sürekli uykuya dalıyorum."
"Luteal fazda yaşanan aşırı gündüz uykululuğu beni gerçekten zorluyor, hatta orta şiddetli uyku apnesi teşhisi bile konuldu."
"Uyku apnesinin yanı sıra, luteal fazda yaşanan aşırı gündüz uykululuğu da hayatımı gerçekten zorlaştırıyor."
"En büyük mücadelelerimden biri, dönemime giden hafta uykudur... Bu sadece beni büyük bir endişeyle dolduruyor ve bugün de o günlerden biri. Şu anda çok endişeli ve üzgünüm; bu korkunç rahatsızlıktan çok yoruldum."
Sınav haftasında uykuya kalamama beni çok endişelendiriyor. Bu hafta da tam bir kabus.
Her dönem öncesi uyuyamama yüzünden çok gergin oluyorum. Bugün de yine aynı hissi yaşıyorum.
Sınav dönemlerinde uyuyamadığım için çok yorgunum ve moralim bozuk. Bu durum gerçekten çok zor.
Bütün hafta boyunca uyuyamadığım için kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Sınav için çok endişeleniyorum.
Bu hafta uyku problemi yüzünden kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Sınav öncesi bu endişe beni tüketiyor.
Götlük moduna giren beynimin mürekkebini hisset... kendini yok etme noktasında aşırı eleştirel olma.
"Beynim, kendini yok etmek üzereymiş gibi eleştiriye boğulmuş, düşüncelerimi bastırmaya çalışıyorum, sakinleşmeliyim."
"Kendimi durmadan eleştirirken buluyorum, sanki beynim yıkıcı bir modda çalışıyor, durmam gerek."
"Bu iç sesim, kendimi eleştiriyle paramparça etmeye çalışıyor, sanki kendini yok etme noktasına gelmiş gibi, sakinleşmeliyim."
"Benim bu acımasız eleştirel düşüncelerim, beynimin beni yok etmeye çalışıyormuş gibi hissettiriyor, durmam gerek."
"Sanki beynim kendi kendini yok etme modunda çalışıyor, bu sürekli eleştiriye son vermeliyim."
Cehennem Haftası'nın fiziksel/zihinsel işkencesi
Cehennem Haftası'nda yaşanan yoğun fiziksel ve zihinsel zorluklar dayanılmazdı.
Fiziksel ve zihinsel olarak çok zorlu bir haftanın ardından artık dinlenmeye ihtiyacım var.
Cehennem Haftası'ndaki yoğun egzersizler hem bedenimi hem de zihnimi yıprattı.
Bu haftaki sınavlar ve ödevler gerçekten de cehennem haftasıydı.
Cehennem Haftası boyunca fiziksel ve zihinsel olarak sürekli zorlandım.
Dışa doğru görüntülemek kolay değil.'spiraling' fazımdayım

"Bir kaos içindeyim, bunu açıklamak ve anlamak çok zor."
"Geçen ay ""PMDD + duygusal olarak akılsız nişanlı"" hakkında yazdım. Bu ay, tekrar yaklaşık 7 gün önce ve sonra tekrar 1 gün önce bir kavga başlattım.... Teşhisimin pasif bir kurbanı oldum ve ondan daha fazla anlayış ve destek talep ettim.... Çok sevimsiz ve öngörülemez oldum.... Geçen yıl veya iki yıl boyunca benimle kalmayı nasıl başardığını bilmek bir mucize."
PMDD'nin duygusal değişimlerimin kontrolünü ele geçirdiğini ve nişanlıma karşı davranışlarımın tahmin edilemez hale geldiğini fark ettim.
"Geçen ay PMDD'nin benim üzerindeki etkisini anlattım, bu ay da aynı şey yaşandı. Çok zorlu bir süreç."
"Doğru olmak gerekirse, PMDD yüzünden nişanlımla kavga etme eğiliminde oluyorum. Sadece bu ay çok daha sık oldu."
PMDD'nin benim üzerindeki olumsuz etkisini açıklamakta zorlanıyorum. Nişanlım bu durumu anlayabilmek için büyük çaba sarf ediyor.
Bu durum nişanlım için oldukça yıpratıcı olmalı. Bu zorlu dönemde bana anlayış gösterdiği için minnettarım.
Bu rollercoaster'dan çok sıkıldım. Folikülerimi seviyorum ama luteal fazım beni öldürecek. Rutin veya istikrar sağlayamam ve partnerimden ayın yarısında nefret ediyorum. Her ay geçmeye çalışırken sadece su basıyormuşum gibi hissediyorum ama bu çok zor geliyor.
"Adet dönemi olmak çok sinir bozucu, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, her şeyden bıktım."
"Bu ayın bu kısmında çok kötü hissediyorum, partnerimden nefret ediyorum, her şeyi bırakmak istiyorum."
"Bu ayın bu kısmında çok sinirliyim, her şeyden nefret ediyorum, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum."
"Birkaç gün içinde kendimi iyi hissedecek miyim, artık her şey çok zor geliyor."
"Ne zaman biteceğini bilmiyorum, her ay kendimi daha kötü hissediyorum."
Bu gece çok üzülüyorum ve neden olduğunu tam olarak belirleyemiyorum üzüntü bugün için bir belirtidir.
"Bugün çok huzursuz hissediyorum, sebebini tam olarak anlayamıyorum ama bu his sanki bir şeylerin yolunda gitmediğini gösteriyor."
"Bir türlü içimde tuhaf bir sıkıntı var, sebebini bilmiyorum ama sanki kötü bir şey olacakmış gibi hissediyorum."

"Müşteriyle konuşurken çok sinirlendim, o kadar çok para kazanıyor ki benden çok daha fazla, kedimde gerginleşmeye başladı."
"O müşteriyle telefonda konuşurken sinirlendim, benden daha zengin ve her zaman kendimi onun yanında çaresiz hissediyorum, bu da beni kedime bağırmaya itiyor."

"Müşteriyle konuşurken sinirlendim, o benden daha zengin ve ben de kedime sinirlenerek bağırmaya başladım."
"Birden fazla histerik çirkin ağlama ve her şeyi görme dürtüsüyle mücadele... ruh halimiz değişir, şişirilmiş olsak bile bize güzel olduğumuzu söyler ve her ay bu sh*t fırtınasında ağlarken ya da öfkelenirken çaresizce seyrederiz."
"Bu düzensiz döngüde kendimizi kaybedip, sonunda kendimizi kontrol altına almaya çalışırız, ancak sonuçlar her zaman aynıdır."
"Ağlamak, öfkelenmek ve çaresiz olmak, bu döngüde bizi esir alıyor gibi görünüyor ve her ay yeniden başlıyoruz."
Ruh halimizin iniş çıkışları bize bir fırtınada savrulan bir gemi gibi hissettiriyor ve bizi durdurabilecek hiçbir şey yok.
"Güzel olduğumuz söylenmesine rağmen, derinlerde kendimizden tiksiniyoruz ve bu durumla başa çıkmak için çaresizce mücadele ediyoruz."
"Kendimizi çaresiz hissettiğimiz bu döngü, her ay bizi yiyip bitiriyor ve ne yapacağımızı bilmiyoruz."
İyiden kötüye gitmekten çok yoruldum. Düşükleri yaşamaktan çok yoruldum. İyiliği çok iyi olduğunda. Ama Tanrım. Kötü çok kötü. Buna değer mi bilmiyorum.
"İyiyle kötünün arasına sıkışıp kalmaktan, sürekli iniş çıkışlarla mücadele etmekten yorulduğumu hissediyorum."
"İyiye ulaşmak için çabalarken, sürekli kötüye doğru savrulmak beni yıpratıyor."
"İyilik bana güzel gelirken, kötülük dayanılmaz bir hal alıyor. Bu mücadeleyi sürdürme gücüm kalmadı."
"İyinin ve kötünün birbiriyle bu kadar çelişmesi, hayatımı anlamsız bir döngüye dönüştürüyor."

"Aşkın büyüsüyle birlikte, ruh halimizin ve düşüncelerimizin daha çabuk değiştiğini fark ediyoruz."
"Romantik bir ilişki içinde olmak, hislerimizin ve düşüncelerimizin yoğunlaşmasına ve değişkenliğine yol açabilir."
"Birini sevdiğinizde, duygularınızın ve düşüncelerinizin daha fazla hareketli olduğunu hissedebilirsiniz."
Adetimden önce korkunç ruh hali değişimleri yaşadım ve sadece deli olduğumu düşündüm. Her ay bir kez histerik olup öfke nöbetleri atardım. Ağlamak ve ertesi gün mükemmel bir şekilde iyi olurdum. Ruh sağlığımı etkiliyor ve tamamen zor... sadece... hayatımın her alanında zor.
"Adet döngümde yaşadığım ruh hali değişimleri beni gerçekten endişelendiriyordu, sanki kontrolümü kaybediyormuşum gibi hissediyordum."
"Her ay aynı şey oluyordu; birdenbire öfkeye kapılıp çığlık atıyordum, sonra birden bire sakinleşiyor ve ağlıyordum."
"Bu durumun sadece bana özgü olmadığını öğrenince biraz rahatladım, birçok kadın benzer şeyler yaşıyormuş."
"İnsanların beni anlamadığını ve deli olduğumu düşündüğünü hissediyordum, bu da beni daha da kötü hissettiriyordu."
"Kendimi kötü hissettiğim günler, normal yaşamımı sürdürmek bile zor oluyordu, işime gitmek, arkadaşlarımla görüşmek... her şey çok zordu."
"O şiddetli depresyon ve anksiyete tekrarlayan nöbetler mücadele ediyordu. Sadece pes etmedi. Doktorlarının randevularına giderek ve ona reçete edilen ilaçları alarak yıllarca kendisi için mücadele etti. Depresyon dayanılmaz hale geldiğinde, kendini kendine zarar verebileceği korkusuyla birden fazla kez psikiyatri hastanelerine kontrol etti. Doktorların ziyaretlerine ve hastanede kalmasına rağmen, sağlık uzmanlarının hiçbiri ne olduğunu fark etmedi. Tedaviye, hatta depresyona, depresyona karşı yanlış teşhis koydular."
"O, ruhsal sağlık mücadelesiyle yıllarca yalnız kaldı."
"Kaygıları ve depresyonu daha da kötüleştiğinde, yardım almak için her yolu denedi."
Psikiyatrik sorunlarının anlaşılmaması onu derin bir umutsuzluğa sürükledi.
"Her tedaviyi denedi, ancak hiçbir sonuç alamadı. Depresyonu, onun için bir bulmacaydı."
"Tüm çabalarına rağmen, kimse onu gerçekten anlamıyordu. Tek başına mücadele etmek zorunda kaldı."
"Yüzümde, burnumda, alnımda ve çenemde her yere çıkabilen bu soğuk yaraları alıyorum. Beni yara izi bıraktılar ve acı verici, sert ve berrak sıvı dolular....."

"Birkaç yıl önce PMDD teşhisi kondu... DEHB teşhisi kondu ve ikisinin bağlantılı olabileceğini ortaya çıkarmaya başladım? DEHB'm için Konçerta'ya yeni başladım, ancak herhangi birinin PMDD semptomlarını hafifleten DEHB ilacı ile herhangi bir deneyimi olup olmadığını merak ediyordum?"

Vücudumun üstündeki sıcak hava balonuna bağlı olduğumu ve hayatın umutsuz olduğunu hissediyorum (KORUNCU olarak öyle olmadığını bilsem de).
Her şeyin kontrolüm dışında olduğunu ve çaresizce sürüklendiğimi hissediyorum.
"Bir şeye sıkıca bağlı olmak yerine, boşlukta yüzdüğümü ve gidecek yerim olmadığını hissediyorum."
"Hayatımı yönetemediğimi, kendimi gelişigüzel olaylara teslim etmek zorunda kaldığımı hissediyorum."
"Umutsuzluk beni sarıyor, her şeyin boşuna olduğunu ve değiştirebileceğim hiçbir şey olmadığını hissediyorum."
Sanki bir ipliğe bağlıyım ve her an kopacakmış gibi hissediyorum.
"Dün, tüm fiziksel acı ve depresif semptomlardan bir tür rahatlama için dibimde dua ediyordum....Bazen iki farklı insan olduğumu hissediyorum."

"Bu günlerde içimde iki ayrı kişiliğin savaştığını hissediyorum, biri umutlu ve biri tamamen karamsar..."

"Pazartesiden beri moralim bozuk, perşembeden beri de kendimi fiziksel olarak yorgun hissediyorum."
Uyuyamadım çünkü ağlamaya devam ettim. Bu yüzden patates püresi yapmaya karar verdim. Sonra ne kadar iyi oldukları hakkında ağladım. Şimdi gülüyorum çünkü bunu gören biri varsa - bu çılgınca görünmüş olmalı.
Uyuyamadım çünkü gece boyunca düşüncelerimle boğuşuyordum. Bu yüzden sabah erken kalkıp kahve yapmaya karar verdim.
Çok yorgundum ama uyuyamıyordum. Bu yüzden kitap okumaya başladım ve çok geçmeden uyuyakaldım.
"Hayatımın o anı çok zorlayıcıydı, kendimi çok yalnız hissediyordum. Bu yüzden arkadaşımı aradım ve uzun uzun konuştuk."
"Kendimi gerçekten kötü hissediyordum, ama bir şeyler yapmam gerektiğini biliyordum. Bu yüzden kendime bir fincan çay demledim ve biraz dinlendim."
Hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyordum. Bu yüzden saatlerce kanepede oturup düşüncelere daldım.
"kenarda, herhangi bir anda gözyaşlarının eşiğinde, titreme, titreme, soğuk ve sıcak basmalar, asit reflü ve mide bulantısı, kabızlık, şişkinlik, gaz ve son ama en az değil delice baş dönmesi... Sadece çok iğrenç hissediyorum. Duş almak istiyorum, kendimden o kadar iğrenç hissediyorum ki ağlamaya gidiyorum. şu anda bunu yazmak için olmasaydı, vücudumu iğrenme içinde obsesif bir şekilde kaşınıyor olurdum."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki vücudum beni reddediyor gibi."
"Bütün vücudum ağrıyor, sanki bin parçaya ayrılmış gibi."
"Midemde bir şeyleri tersine çevirecek kadar kötü hissediyorum, çok iğrenç."
Sanki her yerim yanıyor ve aynı anda buz gibi soğuk hissediyorum.
Bu hissin bir an önce geçmesini ve kendimi tekrar normal hissetmemi diliyorum.
Çok başım dönüyor ve aşırı kaygılanıyorum. 10-20 dakika kadar sürüyor. Sonra adet dönemime başlıyorum.
"Başım çok dönüyor, kaygılı hissediyorum, sanki her şey dönüyor gibi. Belki de adet dönemim yaklaşıyor."
"Bu hissi tanımlamak çok zor, sanki başım dönüyor ve aynı zamanda aşırı kaygılıyım. Bu her ay adet dönemimden önce oluyor."
"Adet dönemimden önce her zaman böyle oluyorum, başım dönüyor, kaygılıyım ve midem bulanıyor. 10-20 dakika sonra geçici olarak rahatlıyorum."
"Çok başım dönüyor ve sanki tüm bedenim titriyor. İlaç almak için çok erken, belki de adet dönemi geliyor."
"Adet dönemim yaklaştığını her zaman böyle anlıyorum, başım dönüyor, kaygılıyım ve sanki her şey ağırlaşıyor. "
"Erken peri + PMDD çok sertti, ancak geç peri PMDD için şaşırtıcı oldu."
Geç peri + PMDD erken peri + PMDD'ye göre daha iyi hissettirdi.

"Geç peri + PMDD, erken peri + PMDD'den daha az acı vericiydi."
"Ne zaman luteal evremde olsam, tam bir kimlik krizi yaşıyorum... Her ay böyle yoğun bir değişimden geçmek hoşuma gitmiyor. Sadece bir ya da iki hafta geçmesi korkunç hissettiriyor çünkü gerçek bir kimliğe sahip olup olmadığımı merak ediyor. Bu lanet bozukluğun merhametinde olmaktan nefret ediyorum."
"Her ay bu ruh halindeki iniş çıkışları yaşamak canımı sıkıyor, sanki kendi bedenimin kontrolünü kaybediyorum."
"Adeta bir başkasının bedeninde sıkışıp kaldığım hissine kapılıyorum, bu durum beni oldukça rahatsız ediyor."
"Bu dönemde kendimi tanıyamaz hale geliyorum, sanki bir yabancı gibi hissediyorum."
"İçsel bir savaş veriyorum, bir yandan eski benliğime tutunmaya çalışırken, diğer yandan bu yeni benliğe ayak uydurmaya çalışıyorum."
"Her ay bu fırtınanın ortasında savrulan bir yaprak gibi hissediyorum, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"Geçen gün beni yemeğe götürdüğü için kendimi kötü hissediyorum, bize 100 dolar harcadı ve bunu geri yapamam. Bunun yeterli olmadığını düşünmeyeceğinden ya da belki de olmadığını düşündüğünden endişeliyim. Akşam yemeğine çıkacağı kadar zevk almayacağından endişeliyim."
"Geçen gün bana yaptığı hediyeyi gerçekten takdir ettim ama şimdi kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, çok pahalıydı ve bunu geri ödeyemem."

"Ona karşı yükümlülük hissetmek istemiyorum, bu kadar pahalı bir hediye alması beni rahatsız etti."
"Kimse size sefaletle nasıl oturacağınızı öğretmiyor. Sefaletin bir verilen olduğunu fark ettim. Ya mutsuzsunuz ya da sağlıklı ya da sağlıksız dikkat dağıtıcılarla sefaletten anlık olarak rahatsızsınız. Bugün, bu şekilde hissetmekten son derece yoruldum. Yorgun hissediyorum. Ve öyle de. Bugün, sefaletle oturacağım. Onunla oturacağım. Sadece dinlemek istiyor."
"Hayatta herkes her zaman mutlu olmuyor, bazen de acı çekmeniz gerekiyor, bunu kabul etmeniz gerekiyor."
"Hayat acı dolu, hepimiz kendimizle yüzleşmeliyiz ve bununla başa çıkmak için yollar bulmalıyız."
"Sıkıntıyla boğuşmayı öğrenmek çok zor, çünkü kimse bize bunu öğretmiyor, ancak bunu kabullenmeli ve kendimizle yüzleşmeliyiz."
"Sıkıntıyı reddetmek, onu çözmekten daha kolay, ancak gerçek şu ki, mutluluk için sıkıntıyla yüzleşmek gerekiyor."
"Hayatın her zaman mutlu bir yolculuk olmadığını anlamak zor, ama gerçek şu ki, sıkıntı da hayatın bir parçası."
"belim yumurtlamadan yaklaşık 5 gün önce krampa başlar, ayrıca çok daha fazla işemek zorunda olduğumu hissediyorum. Sonra tabii ki takip eden hafta pm'lerim var"

"Bugün kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor."
"Bir boşlukta gibi hissediyorum, her şey anlamsız ve uzak."
"Fiziksel olarak çok yorgunum, sanki tüm gücümü kaybetmişim gibi."

"Her şey çok yoğun, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, sadece bu hislerin geçmesini istiyorum."
Sadece luteal aşamadan çıktıktan sonra sadece eşiniz için gözlere sahip olmak için bekar olma düşünceleri mi? Ve sonra belki de bir ilişki için donanımlı olmadığınızı veya hatta bu konuda sıradan bir yaşam sürdüreceğinizi düşünerek

"Bir ilişkiye hazır olmadığınızı düşünürken sadece eşinizin gözlerini görme isteği ve bekar kalma düşüncesi, luteal fazın sizi gerçek duygularınızdan uzaklaştırması mı?"
"Bir düşüncem olacak, bunun incitici olabileceğini fark edeceğim ve bunu söylerken çok memnun olacağım."
"Bazen oldukça sert düşüncelerim oluyor, ancak bunu söylemekten zevk alıyorum."
"İnsanlara karşı acımasız şeyler düşünürüm, ama bunu söyleyebilmek bana garip bir mutluluk veriyor."
"Zihnimde geçen her düşünceyi söylemek isterim, hatta incitici olsalar bile."
İnciciyor olsa bile düşüncelerimi saklamaktansa söylemeyi tercih ediyorum.
Bilerek incitici şeyler söyleyebileceğimi düşünmek beni mutlu ediyor.
"Vücudum ağrıyor ve acıyor, göğsüm patlayacakmış gibi hissediyor. Sanki bir yırtıcı bana saldırmak üzere. Kollarım bile dirseklere kadar yanıyor. Beynim gerçekten acıyor. Başımın arka üst kısmında ateş ve ağrı hissediyorum. Ve zihnim tüm zaman boyunca 'Kendini öldür. Sen değersizsin' diye bağırıyor."

"Psikotik bir kırılma yaşamadım, ancak bir tanesine yaklaşmadan önce gelen uyarı belirtilerini yaşadığımı biliyorum."
"Aslında, bir psikotik kırılmaya doğru ilerliyormuşum gibi hissediyorum, ama tam olarak yaşamadan."

Bu da benim döngümden dolayı oluyor.
Bu durum benim tekrarlayan eylemlerimin bir sonucu.
Bu da benim sürekli aynı şeyi yapmamın getirdiği sonuç.
Bu da benim sürekli aynı rutine bağlı kalmam yüzünden yaşanıyor.

Erkek arkadaşımın gerçek olduğunu ya da gerçek olduğumu düşünmedim. Varoluşsal bir erime gibi. Beni boksuz korkuttu ve tüm bunların büyük bir komplo olduğu korkusundan onu çağırmaktan korktum.
"İlişkinin gerçekliğini sorgulamaya başladım, sanki bir rüya gibi, uyanacağım ve her şeyin bir hayal olduğunu anlayacağım."
"Onun beni sevdiğine inanmakta zorlanıyordum,  sanki bu büyük bir aldatmacaymış gibi hissediyordum."

"Geçtiğimiz gece sürekli yanlış bir şey yaptığım hissiyle uyandım, bir türlü ne olduğunu anlayamadım."
Rüyaların bazen gerçek gibi hissetmesi ve geride kalan endişenin gerçek olduğunu düşünmenizi sağlaması çok garip.
"Rüyamda kendimi çok kötü hissettim, uyanınca hala biraz tedirgindim, sanki gerçekleşmiş gibi."
"O kadar gerçekçi bir rüya gördüm ki, uyandıktan sonra bile bir süre şok içinde kaldım."
Bilinçaltımın bana ne anlatmaya çalıştığını bilmiyorum ama dün geceki rüya beni çok rahatsız etti.
"Zaten bu evde öleceğimi hissediyorum, çünkü sikik parçalanıyor ya da kendimi öldürüyorum çünkü burada sıkışıp kaldım.... PMDD bu hafta intihar düşünceleri bölümünde bana karşı nazik davranmadı."
"Bu evde çıldırıp öleceğimi hissediyorum, sürekli bir çöküş hissi var."
"Bu ev beni yiyip bitiriyor,  burada kaldıkça daha çok paramparça oluyorum."
"Benim için artık burada bir umut ışığı yok, ya kendimi mahvedip öleceğim ya da delireceğim."
"Bu ev bana cehennem gibi geliyor, çıkış yolu bulamıyorum, kendimi mahvediyorum."
"İçeride sıkışıp kaldığım bu evde kendimi paramparça ediyorum, artık dayanamıyorum."
Şimdiye kadar süren derin bir depresyona rasgele battım. RİA depresyonundan daha kötü. İntihar düşüncelerim vardı. (Snap out of their)
"Aniden, derin ve korkunç bir depresyona kapıldım. Daha önce hiç bu kadar kötü hissetmemiştim. Sanki hayatımın anlamı yokmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu hissi tarif edemem, sanki tüm umudumu kaybettim. Hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor. Sadece intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşuyorum."
"Depresyonun beni tamamen ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum. Her şey anlamsız geliyor, hayatımı bitirmeyi bile düşünmeye başladım."
"Günden güne daha kötüye gidiyorum, umutsuzluğa kapılıyorum. Artık hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum ve sürekli ölüm düşüncesiyle boğuşuyorum."
"Sanki içimde kocaman bir boşluk var, hiçbir şey beni dolduramayacak. Bu depresyon beni tamamen tüketti ve artık yaşamaktan bıktım."
"Yıllardır berbat bir PMDD'm vardı, çatladı ve daha fazla dayanamadığımda kombine hapa geçtim....POP'u denedim ve şimdiye kadarki en kötü hataydı, 2 hafta sürdüm, bir çöküş yaşadım, kelimenin tam anlamıyla bir köşede ileri geri sallandım - bu yüzden de çıktı."

Sadece güzel bir doğum günü geçirmesini istiyorum ama kendimi bundan kurtaramıyorum.
Sadece mutlu olmasını istiyorum ama kendimi bunu düşünmekten alamıyorum.
Onu sadece mutlu görmek istiyorum ama bu düşünceyi kafamdan atamıyorum.
İstediğim tek şey onun doğum gününü güzel geçirmesi ama içimde bir burukluk var.
Sadece iyi vakit geçirmesini diliyorum ama içimde garip bir his var.
Onun mutluluğunu istiyorum ama bu düşünceyle başa çıkamıyorum.
"Ruh sağlığı sorunları devreye girdiğinde bunun benim modelim olduğunu fark ediyorum. 1. ve 11. dönemime kötü bir durumdayken başladım - aşırı yorgunluk, büyük olasılıkla benim döngümün bu bölümünde yaşadığım uykusuzluk ve fiziksel yorgunluk gibi bir şey hissetmeme neden oluyor. Yürüyüşe çıkmak ya da yoga yapmak ya da çalışmak istemiyorum (burada masaj terapisti) - yemek özlemi, esas olarak tuz ve şeker motivasyonu yok"
Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak kötü hissettiğim zamanlarda kendimi daha kötü hale getirmekten başka bir şey yapamıyorum.
"Benim için ruh sağlığı sorunları ile başa çıkmak çok zor, özellikle de enerjim olmadığı zamanlarda."
"Motivasyon eksikliği, uykusuzluk ve yorgunluk benim için büyük bir engel oluşturuyor."
"Kendimi yorgun ve tükenmiş hissetmek, düzenli yaşamımı sürdürmeyi zorlaştırıyor."
Hayatımı iyileştirmek için çalışmam gereken bir sürü şey var ama şu anda sadece rahatlamak ve kendime bakmak istiyorum.
"Bu hastalık beni hayatta ve kariyerde geri tutuyor, tek çare bir ay içinde bir milyon şeyin sıraya girmesi mi? Diyet, stres, egzersiz, meditasyon, günlük tutma, takviyeler, alan, boşluk yok, istekler, bu yönetmek için çok fazla"
"Bu hastalık beni her şeyde engelliyor, her şeyi bir ayda düzeltebilir miyim?"
"Her şey bir anda üstüme geldi, bu hastalık beni geri çekiyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Sağlığım, işim, hayatım, hepsi altüst oldu, nasıl düzelteceğim?"
"Her şey bir anda değişti, bu hastalık beni alt üst etti, nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Bu kadar çok şeyle uğraşmak zor, hastalığım beni bunaltıyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Ağlamayı durduramıyorum ve başım ağrıyor. Her ay hayatta kalma modunda gibi hissediyorum, nasıl hayatta kaldığımı biliyorum ama içimde bundan daha fazla kaldığını sanmıyorum lol sadece fiziksel ve duygusal acının sona ermesini istiyorum"
Çok yorgunum ve her şey beni üzüyor. Bu ay gerçekten zor geçti.
"Bu ay çok stresliydim, bir türlü kendime gelemiyorum. Bu acının bir an önce bitmesini istiyorum."
Her şeyden bıktım. Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum.
"Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşıyorum, ne zaman bitecek bilmiyorum. Çok yoruldum."
Sanki sürekli bir savaş halindeyim. Bu kadar acıya daha fazla dayanamam.
Bağımlı bir kişiliğim var. PMDD'den önce ZERO başa çıkma mekanizmalarım vardı ve başa çıkmak için ot kullandım. Onunla rahat bir ilişki kuramıyorum. Luteal özellikle can sıkıntısı sırasında bana endişe verir. Anksiyete kafamdaki düşünce hortumu ve kargaşayı başlatır. Can sıkıntısıyla başa çıkmak için ot kullanıyordum.
"Benim için başa çıkma mekanizmalarıyla dolu bir hayat hiç olmadı, hayatımın bu döneminde ot benim tek sığınağım gibiydi."
"PMDD ve endişelerim, hayatımı kontrol etmenin çok zor olduğu bir noktaya getirdi."
Anksiyete bir kasırga gibi geliyor; her şeyi kendi etrafında savuruyor ve kafamı karıştırıyor.
Luteal fazda kendimle mücadele etmek çok zor. Çaresizliğe kapılıp kendimi kaybediyorum.
Can sıkıntısı beni çok korkutuyor. O an için kendimi sakinleştirmek için ot kullanıyordum.
Duygusal bir enkaz gibi hissetmek... bir takım şeyler için çok üzgün hissetmek ve ağlamayı durduramıyor
"Kendimi tam bir duygusal karmaşa içinde buldum, bazı şeyler beni çok üzüyor ve ağlamayı bırakamam."
"Bir sürü şey yüzünden paramparça oldum, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ve gözyaşlarımı durduramıyorum."
"Duygularım beni mahvetti, kendimi çok üzgün ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Duygusal bir çöküş yaşıyorum, birçok şeyden dolayı çok üzgünüm ve ağlamayı durduramıyorum."
"Kendimi duygusal olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum, birçok şey beni çok üzüyor ve gözyaşlarımı durduramıyorum."
"Doktorum 2019'da PMDD'ye sahip olmamı önerdi, çünkü pm belirtilerim psikotikten psikoza kadar uzanıyor. PMDD, kusurlu bir kişilik özelliği gibi varlığım boyunca öfkelendi ve 7/24 aklımı kaybediyormuşum gibi hissetmem, alaycılığımın ima edebileceğinden daha doğruya daha yakın."
PMDD ile tanıştım ve her şey değişmişti. Aynı insanı olmak için mücadele ediyordum.
"PMDD'nin benim için anlamına gelen şey, hayatımın önemli bölümlerinin kontrolünü kaybettiğimdi."
"PMDD ile yaşadığım dönemde, tüm zamanımı aklımda olup bitenleri düzeltmeye çalışarak geçirdim."
"PMDD'nin beni tanımlayan bir durum değil, sadece yaşadığım bir şey olduğunu hatırlatmak zorunda kaldım."
PMDD'nin duygusal iniş çıkışları ve duygusal dengesizlikleriyle başa çıkmak her zaman bir mücadeleydi.
Dün 430'dan beri tuvalete gitmediğinden ve rahatsız olmasını istemediğinden beri tamamen OKB'yim... Onun hakkında tamamen OKB'yim ve her seferinde üstesinden gelmek için gideceğini umarak onu çıkarmaya çalışıyorum ve sonra her seferinde reddediyor
Dün 430'dan beri tuvalete gitmediğinden ve artık dayanamayacağım için tamamen OKB'yim...
"Bu tuvalet konusu benim için tam bir saplantı haline geldi, sürekli kontrol ediyorum, sanki o tuvalet beni ele geçirecekmiş gibi."
"Her şeyden önce, onun hakkında OKB'yim ve bu yüzden sürekli olarak onu aşmaya çalışıyorum, fakat o her seferinde beni reddediyor."
"430'dan beri tuvalete gitmediğimden beri her şeyden önce OKB'yim. Bu konuda tamamen kontrolsüzüm, sürekli kontrol ediyorum, endişeleniyorum..."
"Bir türlü reddedemediğim bu tuvalet düşüncesiyle sürekli boğuşuyorum. Tam bir OKB vakası gibi. Onu bastırmaya çalışıyorum, ama o hep geri geliyor."
Beyin sisi ve anksiyete atm'im var ama zihinsel aletlerimi kullanamıyorum çünkü beynim çok zayıf. Şu anda günlük hayatımda kendimi hazır hissetmiyorum.
"Beynim çok yorgun ve düşüncelerim dağınık, bugün işlerime konsantre olmakta zorlanıyorum."
"Zihnim yoğun ve bunalmış, şu anda hiçbir şey yapmaya gücüm yok."
"Kendimi tükenmiş hissediyorum, ne yapacağımı bilemiyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Beynim bulanık, odaklanamıyorum, bugün yapmam gereken her şey bana çok zor geliyor."
"Anksiyeteden dolayı beynim tamamen boş, bugün işime odaklanamıyorum, kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum."
Yeterince erkek/romantik ilgi görmezsem k**lling m****f hakkında düşünme ihtiyacı hissediyorum
Beni önemseyen biri olmadığında kendimi yalnız ve çaresiz hissediyorum.
"Kimse bana ilgi göstermiyorsa, hayattan zevk almakta zorlanıyorum."
"Birine aşık olduğumu hissetmek, yaşamak için bir sebep veriyor."
Hiçbirinin beni sevmediğini düşünmek çok acı verici.
"Biriyle duygusal bir bağ kuramazsam, varoluşumu sorgulamaya başlıyorum."
PMDD'min tüm ilaçlarıma ve takviyelerime rağmen enerji seviyeme gerçekten meydan okuduğunu biliyorum. Dün gece buna rastladım ve kendimi hiçbir şey yapmaya ikna edemedim...
PMDD'nin beni gerçekten yıprattığı zamanlar oluyor ve tüm çabalarıma rağmen kendimi enerjisiz hissediyorum.
"Bu PMDD gerçekten zorlu, ne kadar ilaç ve takviye kullansam da bazen enerjim tamamen tükeniyor."
Dün gece yine PMDD'nin pençesinde kaldım ve kendimi hiçbir şey yapmaya zorlayamadım.
"PMDD'nin enerji seviyem üzerindeki etkisini gerçekten hissediyorum, sanki tüm gücümü emiyor."
"Bu PMDD'nin ne zaman patlayacağını kestirmek imkansız, dün gece yine tüm enerjimi elimden aldı."
"Kelimenin tam anlamıyla bu sabah mittelschmerz hissetti - snap, crackle, yumurtalıkların pop. Gün 14, saat gibi. Ve ağrı popo lolüme gitti. Muhtemelen bir yumurtayı serbest bırakmak yerine yırttıkları bir yumurtalık kistidir."
"Bu sabah mittelschmerz'den resmen deliye döndüm - snap, crackle, yumurtalıklarım çatır çatır. Gün 14, saat gibi geldi."
"Yumurtalıklarım patlıyor, resmen mittelschmerz yaşıyorum. Gün 14'te bu normal mi bilmiyorum ama canımın yandığı kesin."
"Bugün yumurtalıklarım ateş püskürüyor, mittelschmerz denen illetten resmen deliye döndüm. Bu saat gibi geldi."
Resmen mittelschmerz'den öldüm. Gün 14'te bu ağrıların gelmesi normal mi bilmiyorum ama ağrıdan popo lolüme gittim.
"Yumurtalıklarım patlıyor, resmen mittelschmerz yaşıyorum. Bu ağrıya dayanamıyorum, herhalde bir yumurtalık kisti patladı."
Yemin ederim IUD bana PMDD verdi ve Yaz benim kaygı dayanılmaz yaptı. Ben sadece her ay psikotik bir canavara dönüşmek istemiyorum ve aynı zamanda depresif bir patates çuvalına dönüşmemeyi tercih ediyorum.
"Hormonal doğum kontrolü hayatımı mahvetti, her ay yaşadığım duygusal iniş çıkışlar dayanılmaz hale geldi."
"Benim için Yaz kullanımı inanılmaz derecede zorlayıcı oldu, her ay inanılmaz bir kaygı dalgası yaşıyorum."
"Bu hormonlar benimle oynuyor, bir ay canavara, bir ay da depresif bir çöplüğe dönüşüyorum, bu böyle devam edemez."
"IUD taktırdığımdan beri her ay PMS'im inanılmaz derecede şiddetleniyor, bu durum artık hayatımı etkiliyor."
"Bu durumun çözümü yok mu? Her ay bu kadar zorlanmaktan bıktım, normal bir hayat yaşamak istiyorum."
"O sadece bazı ders kitabı PMDD belirtileri yaşayacaktı, çok yoğun bir şey değil, ama iş ve ev hayatı için rahatsız edici olurdu. Sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kanardı."
"O, PMDD'nin hafif belirtilerini yaşayacağını düşünüyordu, çok ciddi değildi ama işini ve ev hayatını etkilerdi. Sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kan geldi."
"PMDD semptomlarıyla uğraşacağını düşünüyordu,  o kadar kötü değildi ama günlük yaşamını zorlaştırırdı. Ama sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kan aktı."
"Sadece hafif PMDD belirtileri olacağını tahmin ediyordu, çok büyük bir sorun değildi, ama işini ve evini zorlaştırırdı. Sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kan aktı."
"PMDD'nin hafif belirtilerini yaşayabileceğini düşünüyordu, hayatını çok etkilemezdi, ancak işini ve evini etkilerdi. Sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kan aktı."
"Sadece PMDD'nin hafif belirtilerini yaşayacağını düşünüyordu, bir sorun değildi ama işini ve evini etkilerdi. Sonra 5 gün boyunca penisinden kan aktı."
Beyin sisi ve şişmanlığı. Sadece saklanmak ve bugün kimseyi görmemek ya da kimseye cevap vermemek istiyorum. Düşünemiyorum.
"Bugün çok yorgunum, odaklanamıyorum, dış dünyayla iletişim kurmak bile istemiyorum."
"Beynim çalışmıyor, kendimi kötü hissediyorum, kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum."
"Düşünmek için enerjim yok, kendime çekilmek ve dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Yorgunluktan başka hiçbir şey düşünmek istemiyorum, bugün kimseyi görmemek ve konuşmamak istiyorum."
"Beynim bulanık, kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum, sadece sessizliğe ihtiyaç duyuyorum."
"Geçtiğimiz Ağustos ayında bir bebeğim oldu. Hamilelik, hissettiğim en iyi şeydi ve yaklaşık 8 aya kadar harika bir doğum sonrası deneyimi yaşadım. Belirtilerimin geri döndüğünü hissediyorum ve gerçekten bunun önüne geçmek istiyorum, böylece mümkün olan en iyi anne ve ortak olabilirim. Bir ay boyunca haftada iki kez akupunktur yapıyorum ve zihinsel durumum geçen günden beri daha kötü. Beni geri yansıtıyor ve her seferinde depresyona sokmaya çalıştığımı fark ediyorum, bu beni çok etkiledi ve depresyona soktu."
"Doğum sonrası dönem inanılmazdı, ancak şimdi belirtilerim geri dönüyor ve bununla başa çıkmak için her şeyi yapmam gerekiyor."
Akupunktur beni gerçekten yordu ve şimdi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Bu depresyon hissi her şeyimi mahvediyor ve kendimi kötü hissetmeme sebep oluyor.
"Anne olmak için her şeyi yapacağım, ama bu akupunktur bana çok kötü geliyor."
"Bir anne olarak mümkün olan en iyi şekilde olmak istiyorum, ama depresyonun beni durdurmasına izin vermeyeceğim."
"Şu anda kendimi çok şişkin ve güzel hissetmiyorum, çoğunlukla iyi duygular hissediyorum, sadece kendimle ilgileneceğim ve biraz da kendi başımın çaresine bakacağım."
"Bugün kendimi pek iyi hissetmiyorum, içimde bir ağırlık var, sadece biraz zaman ayıracağım kendime."
"Şu an biraz yorgunum, kendimle ilgilenmem ve biraz dinlenmem gerek."
"Kendimi biraz mutsuz hissediyorum, bu yüzden yalnız kalmak ve kendimle ilgilenmek istiyorum."
"Şu an içimde bir karmaşa var, kendime biraz zaman ayırmam gerek, rahatlamak ve kendimi toparlamak için."
"Bu günlerde kendimi biraz yalnız hissediyorum, kendimle ilgilenmem ve biraz zaman geçirmeyi planlıyorum."
Beyinde ve vücutta defalarca çok fazla travma
Beyin ve vücutta çok fazla acı çektim.
Çok sayıda travmatik olay yaşadım.
Hem bedenim hem de zihnim çok yıpranmış durumda.
Kendimi defalarca zorlu durumların içinde buldum.
Hayatım boyunca çok fazla acı ve travma yaşadım.
"PMDD belirtilerim (anksiyete, düşük ruh hali, düşük enerji, ajitasyon, dp / dr) çoğunlukla dönemimden hemen önce ortaya çıkar, hemen sonra kötüleşir ve yumurtlamadan sonraya kadar dalgalar halinde devam eder / kapanır"
"PMDD belirtilerim, dönemime girmeden önce artmaya başlıyor, dönemimden hemen sonra daha da kötüleşiyor ve yumurtlama sonrasına kadar devam ediyor."
"Döne mimden önce başlayan ve yumurtlama sonrasında azalan bir dalgalanma içinde, PMDD belirtilerim beni tam olarak ele geçiriyor."
"Anksiyete, düşük ruh hali, düşük enerji, ajitasyon ve depersonalizasyon/derealizasyon, dönemimden hemen önce başlayıp, dönemimden hemen sonra zirveye ulaşıyor ve yumurtlama sonrasında yavaşça azalıyor."
"PMDD belirtilerimle her ay aynı döngüyü yaşıyorum: dönemimden önce başlıyor, dönemimle birlikte yoğunlaşıyor ve yumurtlama sonrasında yavaşça azalıyor."
PMDD belirtilerimin dönemimle ilişkili olduğunu ve yumurtlamadan hemen sonra azaldığını fark ettim.
"Bu hafta boyunca bpd tipi eylemlerim ve duygularım var. Kötü seçimler yapmaya, heyecanlı enerji üzerindeki vızıltıyı dindirmek için daha fazla içmeye meyilliyim. Rahatsız edici derecede yüksek. Bazen depresyon tarafını tercih ediyorum bc Üzgünüm ama bu kontrol edilemez pervasız bir duygu değil."
Bu haftaki duygusal dalgalanmaların beni gerçekten zorluyor. Düşük hissettiğimde kendime daha iyi hissettirmek için içmeye eğiliyorum.
"BPD'nin bu hafta beni gerçekten zorladığını hissediyorum. İçmek, yoğun enerjiyi azaltmaya yardımcı oluyor ama bu sadece geçici bir çözüm."
BPD'nin beni sürekli olarak heyecanlı bir enerjiyle ya da derin bir üzüntüyle başa çıkmak zorunda bıraktığı için bu hafta beni gerçekten zorluyor.
"Duygularımı kontrol etmekte zorlandığım bu hafta, içmenin cazibesine kapıldım. Bunu yapmanın doğru olduğunu bilmiyorum, ama bir şekilde rahatlatıcı hissettiriyor."
"Bu hafta BPD nedeniyle aşırı duygusal değişimler yaşıyorum. Bu iniş çıkışlar, kötü kararlar vermeme ve kendimi uyuşturmak için içme isteğime yol açıyor."
"Son 3 saattir ağlıyorum. Eve gitmem gerekiyordu ve hiperventilasyon yapıyordum, kelimenin tam anlamıyla arabada çığlık atarak çok sert sallanıyordum. Bunu yazarken biraz daha iyi hissediyorum ama evet belki biraz daha sonra ağlarım"
"Gerçekten çok kötü hissediyorum, şu an ağlamaktan bitkin düştüm."
"Sanki vücudumun her yerinde bir ağrı var, sanırım kendimi kötü hissettiğim için ağlıyorum."
"O kadar kötü hissediyorum ki gözlerim şişti, arabada ağlarken nefes alamıyordum."
"Bugün çok kötü bir gün geçirdim, umarım kendimi biraz daha iyi hissedebilirim."
"Umarım bugün her şey normale döner, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, çok üzgünüm."
Ayakkabılarımı bulamadığım bir noktada spiralledim ve daha sonra temelde hiçbir şey yoktu ve ortağım yeterliydi ve bensiz eve gittim. Daha sonra sarhoş bir acıma partisi verdim ve çok fazla duygusal acı çekerken beni yalnız bıraktığı için ağlayan korkunç bir gece geçirdim.
"Ayakkabılarımı bulamadığımda paniğe kapıldım, sonra da yalnız kaldım. Ortağım beni beklemedi ve ben de kendimi kötü hissettim."
Eve gidip bir içki içtim ve tüm gece yalnızlığımı düşündüm. Ortağım olmadan çok kötü hissediyorum.
Evde yalnız kalmak çok zor. Ortağım benimle gelmeyince çok kötü hissettim.
Ayakkabılarımı bulamayınca her şey çökmeye başladı. Sonra da ortağım benimle gelmeyince içki içip ağladım.
Yalnız kaldığımda kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum. Ortağım beni yalnız bıraktığı için çok üzgünüm.
Kronik olarak depresyondayım ve yapmamam gereken kötü şeyleri düşünüyorum. Sadece sinirli olduğum için sürekli arkadaşlıkları koparmak ve köprüleri yakmak istiyorum. Küçük şeyler için çok kızgın hissediyorum. Yine manikleşiyorum gibi hissediyorum. Tekrar gerçeklik hissimi kaybetmeme izin vermeyeceğim. Çok yorgunum. Sadece depresyondayım. Sadece geri dönmek bile istemiyorum.
"Yine, her şeyin üzerine atlamak ve her şeyle tartışmak istiyorum, ama bunun sonunda bana zarar vereceğini biliyorum. Bu öfkeyi kontrol edemiyorum."
Arkadaşlarımın beni anlayamayacağını ve onlara kızdığımı düşünüyorum. Her şeye bağırmak istiyorum ama bu bana iyi gelmeyecek.
Kendimi kötü hissetmek için bir bahane arıyorum. Belki de bu yüzden kendimi zorluyorum ve her şeyin kötü olduğunu söylüyorum.
Geçmişte bu kötü kararlar yüzünden ne kadar acı çektiğimi biliyorum. Bunun tekrar olmasını istemiyorum ama beynim beni kontrol edemiyor.
Öfkemin beni ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum. Bu sadece geçici ve sonra kendimi daha kötü hissedeceğim. Her şeyi bırakmak istiyorum.
"Bu sabah arabamı köprüden sürmeye çalıştım. Yapmadığımda kendimi bir ezik gibi hissettim. Hiç bu kadar kötü bir depresyonda değildim, asla bu kadar yalnız ve bu kadar boş bir hayat yaşamamıştım. Salı günü hala 18 tekerlekli bir tekerlek tarafından vuruldum. Artık baş edemiyorum. Tam anlamıyla başa çıkamıyorum. İşe gitmek için bir saatim var ve tüm zaman ağladım. 18 tekerleğin olmadığı zaman çok çılgındım."
Bu hafta çok fazla şey oldu ve sanırım bu beni gerçekten alt etti.
Hayatımda ilk defa kendimi bu kadar umutsuz hissediyorum.
"Kendimi sadece bir araba kazası kurbanı olarak değil, aynı zamanda mutsuz ve yalnız bir insan olarak da görüyorum."
İçinde bulunduğum durum beni gerçekten ürkütüyor.
Bu durumla başa çıkmak için çok fazla desteğe ihtiyacım var.

PMDD semptomlarımı yönetmek için bir SSRI alıyorum.

"Bazen depresyon, anksiyete, migren, çok düşük enerji gibi dönemim bittikten hemen sonra pmdd semptomlarını hissediyorum. Adetimden sonra birkaç gün düşük ve depresif hissediyorum."
"Adet döngümün sonrasında sanki bir sis çöküyor üzerime, enerjim düşüyor, düşüncelerim kararıyor, depresif ve anksiyete dolu oluyorum."
"Dönemimin bitmesinden sonra kendimi yorgun, motivasyonsuz, hatta hafif depresyonda hissetmek beni çok üzüyor."
Adetimden sonra gelen günlerde migren ve düşük enerji ile baş etmek zorunda kalmak oldukça yıpratıcı olabiliyor.
"Adetim sona erdikten sonra birkaç gün boyunca hissettiğim halsizlik ve mutsuzluk, benim için adeta bir kabusa dönüşüyor."
"Dönemim bittiğinde fiziksel ve duygusal olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum, sanki bedenim ve zihnim bir savaş vermiş gibi."
"Sürekli gece terlemesi, üç gün boyunca migren, yemek yiyememe, mide bulantısı, mutlak öfke... Tekrar yemek yemeye başladım, tam bir yemek yedim ve gece boyunca minimum terle uyudum."
"Geçtiğimiz üç gün, tam bir kâbus gibiydi. Uykuya dalmak neredeyse imkansızdı, her gece ter içinde uyanıyordum. Başımın ağrısı beni delirtiyordu ve ne yemek ne de su içebiliyordum. Öfkem sürekli olarak kabararak, hayatımı bir cehenneme çeviriyordu."
"Sanki vücudum bana karşı savaş açmış gibiydi. Migrenin şiddeti beni yataktan bile kalkamaz hale getiriyordu, sürekli olarak terliyordum ve ne yiyebilir ne de içebilirdim. Sanki hayatımın sonuna gelmiş gibi hissediyordum."
"İçinde bulunduğum durum, her geçen gün kötüleşiyordu. Günlerce süren şiddetli migrenler, gece boyunca terlemeler ve sürekli olarak mide bulantısı... Hayatımın hiçbir noktasında bu kadar kötü hissetmemiştim."
"Üç gün boyunca süren bu kötü hisler, vücudumu iyice yormuştu. Sürekli olarak terliyordum, başım ağrıyor, mide bulantısı çekiyordum ve öfkemi kontrol edemiyordum. Sanki bir hastalık beni yavaş yavaş tüketiyordu."
"Hiçbir şey eskisi gibi değildi. Her şey bir anda değişti, sanki bir lanet üzerime çökmüş gibiydi. Gece terlemesi, baş ağrısı, mide bulantısı ve sinir bozukluğu... Bunların hepsi benim hayatımı alt üst etmişti."
"Dün gece zar zor uyudum ve şimdi inanılmaz bir şekilde hayattan bunalmış hissediyorum, her şey çok zor görünüyor."

"Uykusuz bir gecenin ardından bugün inanılmaz bir şekilde yorgun ve bunalmış hissediyorum, her şey aşırı zorlayıcı görünüyor."

"Dün gece neredeyse hiç uyuyamıyorum, bugün de her şey çok zor ve bunaltıcı hissettiriyor, sanki tüm motivasyonumu kaybetmişim gibi."
"PMDD son birkaç gün içinde sessizliğime neredeyse ihanet etti. Bu piçin ne yaptığını duydum ve kanım o kadar sert kaynadı ki bunu duyabiliyorum. Şu anda suçluluk duygusuna kapılmış PMDD erimesinde, çünkü onu saçmalıklarıyla çağırdım ve'masumluğunu' çok ikna etti, ama aslında her şeyi hayal ettiğimi söyleyerek beni gazlandırmaya çalışıyor. Şimdi aklımı sorguluyorum ama mahkumiyetimi değil ve bu iyi bir zaman değil."
PMDD beni son birkaç gün içinde inanılmaz derecede öfkelendirmiş gibi hissettirdi. 
"Bu son zamanlarda hissettiğim şeyin PMDD yüzünden olduğuna emin değilim, ama bu kadar çok sinirlendiğime inanmak istemiyorum."
"Bu olayı çok abarttığımı ve aslında her şeyi hayal ettiğimi düşünüyorum, ama bu gerçekten sinir bozucu."
"PMDD beni son zamanlarda çok duygusal yapıyor, umarım bu geçer."
Kendimi aptal hissediyorum ve bunun PMDD yüzünden olduğunu düşünüyorum.

"Zaten yatakta çürümenin ve felç noktasına kadar doomscrolling'in sadece kaygı ve ilgisizliği daha da kötüleştirdiğini biliyorum, ancak PMS'm dolaştığında ""yapmayı seviyorum"" hissettiğim tek şey.... Bu yüzden onu beklemeye ve kendini izole etmeye geri dönüyorum.... Onları rahatsız etmek istemiyor ve ""onlara ulaşmak için ihtiyacım olduğunu"" hissedecek kadar ""depreslenmiş"" gibi hissetmiyorum."
"Bilmiyorum, belki de kendime sadece biraz zaman ayırmam gerekiyor, belki de bu zamanı geçirmenin en iyi yolu, tamamen yalnız kalmak."
"Sanırım ben de böyle hissediyorum, bazen gerçekten insanların etrafında olmayı bırakıp biraz sakinleşmem gerekiyor."
"Biliyorum ki herkes böyle hissetmiyor, ama bazen herkesin biraz uzaklaşması ve kendi kendine olmasına ihtiyacı olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"İnsanların sizi anlayabilmesi çok zor, özellikle de bu konularda."
"Bunu herkese açıklamak zor, ama gerçek bu, bazen kendime zaman ayırmam gerekiyor ve bunu yapmanın en iyi yolu da kendi başıma zaman geçirmek."

Erkek arkadaşıma her ay bundan şikayet ettiğim için sinir bozucu hissediyorum... Her bu şekilde olduğumda daha az ciddi olduğunu hissediyorum... Çok sinirleniyorum. Sadece NORMAL olmak istiyorum gibi. Her zaman mutlu hissetmek zorunda değilim ama yetişkin hayatımın yarısını depresif hissetmemek istiyorum.
"Erkek arkadaşımla her ay aynı şeyleri konuşmaktan bıktım, kendimi tekrar eden biri gibi hissediyorum."
"Sürekli aynı sorunları dile getirmek beni hayal kırıklığına uğratıyor, sanki kendi hayatımda hiçbir ilerleme kaydetmiyor gibi."
"Bu konuda sürekli konuşmam gerekiyorsa bir çözüm bulmak için çaba göstermiyor gibi hissediyorum, bu da beni umutsuzluğa düşürüyor."
Her şeyin yoluna gireceğine inanmak istiyorum ama sürekli aynı döngüde takılıp kalmak beni pes ettirmek üzere.
"Sanki kendimde bir değişiklik yapamıyormuşum gibi hissediyorum, bu da beni yetersiz ve çaresiz hissettiriyor."
"Benim gibi hiç kimsenin, tartışmalara girmeye çalıştığımı, ancak düşüncelerimin her zaman 'Kimse seni duymak istemiyor', 'çok fazla konuşacaksın', 'garipsin' olduğunu düşünüyorum.

Bir süre böyle hissediyorum ve 2 günlük süremle kendimi spiral gibi hissediyorum ve eve gidip battaniyelerin altına girmek ve asla dışarı çıkmak istemiyorum."

"Tek başıma dağlara tırmanmak, hiçbir iletişim olmadan günlerce yalnız kalmak istiyorum."

Normal bir döngüye geri dönmüş gibi görünsem de lutealde sıkıştım. Durduktan 3 hafta sonra bir dönem geçirdim ve sadece semptomların yoğunlaşması ve hayatımın en kötü depresyonu ve endişesi ile vurulması için geldiğinde rahatlamayı bekliyordum.

Öfke ve uyuşukluk hissediyorum hepsi bir arada

Sonunda dün gece acil servise gittim çünkü doktorum artık benimle ne yapacağını bilmiyordu. 12 saat acil serviste psikiyatristi telefonla görmeyi umarak bekledim ama onun yerine yaşlı bir beyaz doktor bana muhtemelen depresyonda olduğumu söyledi.
Doktorum artık ne yapacağını bilmediği için acil servise gitmek zorunda kaldım.
"Acil serviste saatlerce bekledim, doktorum telefonla psikiyatristi görmeyi umuyordu."
"Acil serviste psikiyatristin gelmesini beklerken, bana muhtemelen depresyonda olduğumu söylediler."
"Saatlerce acil serviste bekledim, ama bana gerçekten yardım edebilecek birisiyle görüşemedim."

"Oldukça ciddi PMDD'm var ve yaşla birlikte daha da kötüleşiyor....beni zayıflatıyor,...kendimi her türlü zarardan vazgeçirebiliyorum, ki bu iyi beni yanlış anlamaz ama aslında beni yatıştırmak için hiçbir şey yapmaz. Gerçekten hayatıma, zihinsel sağlığıma, ilişkilerime müdahale ediyor..."

Çocuklarıma karşı kaybediyorum ve öfke geçtikten sonra utançla uğraşmak zorunda kalıyorum... Dört kuzenim sonunda sinir bozucu bir kavgaya girdiğinde ne olacağını hayal etmeye devam ediyorum ve bir öfkeye giriyorum ya da BIL'imin söylediği bir şeye kızıp onu kaybedersem.
"Çocuklarla olan ilişkilerimde sabrımı kaybettiğimde, daha sonra utanç duygusuyla karşı karşıya kalıyorum."
"Duygularımı kontrol edemediğim zamanlarda kendimi kötü hissediyorum, özellikle de çocuklarımla kavga ettiğimde."

"Çocuklarımla olan tartışmalarım beni çok üzüyor, öfkem geçtiğinde kendimi suçlu hissediyorum."
"Çocuklarla olan ilişkilerimdeki zorluklar bazen öfkelenmeme neden oluyor, ardından da pişmanlık duyuyorum."
"Kilo aldım, motive olmadım, depresyona girdim, öfkelendim. Sürekli erimeler, hiçbir şey yapamam. Erkek arkadaşımdan nefret ediyorum, seksten zevk alamıyorum, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum, okula geri dönemeyeceğimden korkuyorum, o beni terk edene kadar ortağımı korkutacağım."

Bir gün uyanın ve arkadaşlarınızın ve meslektaşlarınızın sizi hor gördüğü veya kovulmanızı istediği yoğun suçluluk ve paranoyayı hissedin... Sadece korkunç şeyler söyleyen ve yapan rahatsız edici bir insan olduğunuz hissini sarsamazsınız... Bu tutarlı mantıksız kaygı... Bazen panik ataklarım var. Bunu rasyonelleştirmek zor ve çok müdahaleci ve her şeyi tüketen
"Her sabah işe giderken, iş arkadaşlarımın bana kötü baktığını veya beni istemediğini düşündüğümde derin bir kaygı hissediyorum."
Çevremdekilerden gelen en ufak eleştiri bile beni derinden etkiliyor ve kendimi suçlu hissetmeme neden oluyor.
"Bazen arkadaşlarımla sohbet ederken, söylediklerim veya yaptıklarım onları rahatsız etti mi diye endişeleniyorum."
Kendime güvenmekte zorlanıyorum ve sürekli bir hata yapma korkusu ile yaşıyorum.
Bu düşünceler beni ele geçiriyor ve günlük hayatımı etkilemekten vazgeçemiyorum.
"PMDD'mden ve gerçek duygularımdan dolayı ne olduğunu bilmemek gerçekten yorucu. Köşeye çekildiğimi hissettiğimde çok stresli oluyorum. Dürüst olmak gerekirse, hayatı hiç hissetmiyorum."
"PMDD'min belirtileriyle başa çıkmak, bir de üstüne gerçek duygularımın ne olduğunu anlamaya çalışmak beni gerçekten tüketiyor."
"Sanki bir sisin içindeymişim gibi, ne yapmam gerektiğini, ne hissetmem gerektiğini bilemiyorum, bu da beni oldukça gergin yapıyor."
"Kendimi dışlanmış, yalnız ve anlamsız hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor, sanki hayatın anlamını kaybetmişim gibi."

"Bu sürekli gerilimi, bu tartışmaları ve kavgaları kaldırabileceğimi düşünmüyorum."
"İlişkinin geleceği hakkında hep şüpheler var, bu sürekli belirsizlik beni tüketiyor."
"Sanki ilişkinin temelini sürekli sorguluyoruz, bu durum beni huzursuz ediyor."
"Artık bu istikrarsızlığı kaldıracak gücüm kalmadı, bu evlilikte mutluluk arayamayacağımı düşünüyorum."
7/24 kötüleşen PMDD belirtileri yaşamak
"PMDD belirtileri her gün, hatta gece boyunca bile daha kötüye gidiyor."
"PMDD'nin etkisini her zaman hissediyorum, günün her saatinde."

Gece ve gündüz PMDD belirtileri nedeniyle acı çekiyorum.
"Bu PMDD belirtileri her an daha kötüye gidiyor, asla rahatlayamıyorum."

"Kendimi çok üzgün ve depresif hissediyorum, sık sık zihinsel çöküntü geçiriyorum ve bu durum, daha önce yaşadığım kaygılarımı daha da artırdı."
"Belirtilerim: Yorgunluk en kötü semptomumdur, bunu çok kötü depresyon, öfke ve antisosyallik izler ve daha sonra şişkinliğim, kramplarım ve anksiyetem tamamen eşit olur. Bazen beyin sisi alıyorum, ancak her döngüde değil."
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak kötü hissediyorum, yorgunluk beni gerçekten yıpratıyor."
"Depresyon, öfke ve sosyalleşmekten kaçınmak yorgunluktan sonra en büyük sorunlarım."
"Karın şişkinliği, kramplar ve anksiyete yorgunluk ve diğer belirtilerle aynı oranda beni etkiliyor."
"Yorgunluğun yanı sıra sürekli bir depresyon, öfke ve sosyalleşmekten kaçınma halindeyim."
"Bazen beynim bulanıklaşıyor, ancak bu her seferinde olmuyor, diğer belirtilerle beraber yaşadığım sıkıntıları artırıyor."
Çizimlerimden nefret etmek ve bu konuda kendime bu kadar sert olmak ve kendimi beceriksiz hissetmemi sağlıyor.
Çizimlerimin yetersiz olduğunu düşünmek ve bu konuda kendime bu kadar acımasız olmak beni gerçekten üzüyor.
Kendimi çizim yaparken beceriksiz hissetmem ve bu konuda sürekli kendimi eleştirmem beni kahrediyor.

Kendimi beceriksiz hissetmemi sağlayan en büyük faktör çizimlerimle ilgili bu acımasız eleştirilerim.
Çizimlerime baktıkça kendimi yetersiz hissetmek ve bu konuda kendime bu kadar sert davranmak beni bunaltıyor.
"Durmadan kabuslar görüyorum. Örneğin, yalnız kalma konusunda bu kadar şiddetli bir endişeyle boğuşuyordum... Şu an kaygıyla mücadele etmedim. En azından, geçmişte olduğu kadar mide bulandırıcı görünmüyor. Dönemime başladığımdan beri, bu sorunlar tam olarak geri geldi. Çalışmak için hiçbir motivasyonum yok, hatta normalde zevk aldığım hobilerden herhangi birini bile yapamam. Kabuslar, uyku felci, sürekli korku ve korku yaşıyorum."
"Anksiyeteyle başa çıkmak benim için çok zor, özellikle de kabuslar ve uyku felciyle boğuşurken."
"Korkularımın bu kadar yoğun olması, günlük işlerimi ve hobilerimi yapmaktan alıkoyuyor."
"İlaçlar sayesinde anksiyete biraz azaldı, ama yine de korkunç kabuslar görüyorum."
Duygusal iniş çıkışlar ve sürekli korku hissi beni çok yoruyor.
"Geçmişte anksiyeteyle başa çıkmak daha kolaydı, ama şimdi sanki her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
Adetimden bir ya da iki hafta önce gerçekten kötü anksiyete ve ruh hali değişimleri yaşıyorum. Son 2 yılda o kadar kötüleşti ki iş hayatımı etkiliyor.
"Adet döngüm yaklaşırken, anksiyete ve ruh halimde büyük dalgalanmalar yaşamaya başladım."
"Özellikle adet dönemime yakın haftalarda kendimi kontrolsüz hissediyorum, sanki bir duygusal fırtınaya kapılıyorum."
"Son birkaç yıldır adet öncesi sendromumun şiddeti arttı, iş performansımı bile etkiliyor."
"Birkaç hafta öncesinden başlayan anksiyete ve ruh halindeki iniş çıkışlar, hayatımı olumsuz etkiliyor."
"Adet dönemime doğru, sanki içimde kontrolsüz bir güç devreye giriyor, sanki bambaşka biri oluyorum."

"Orto tri-cyclen'li bir genç olarak HORRIBLE bir deneyim yaşadım;... veba gibi OC'lerden kaçındım, hipomanimi korumayı ve aralıklı SSRI'ları kullanmayı tercih ettim....Aniden alkol zehirlenmesi ile ER'de sona eren özensiz bir sarhoş sürüş felaketi yerine toplumun sorumlu, saygın bir üyesiyim."
"Orto tri-cyclen'i kullanmaya başladığımda, bedenimde çok kötü bir değişim yaşadım ve kendimi sürekli hasta hissettim."
"Tri-cyclen tedavisinin yan etkilerinden dolayı, sosyal hayatım büyük bir etki gördü ve dışarı çıkmaktan kaçınıyordum."
"Hipomanik durumlarımı kontrol altında tutmak için ilaçlara güvenmeyi tercih ettim, çünkü tri-cyclen'in verdiği duygusal iniş çıkışlar beni korkutuyordu."
"Şimdi her şeyden önce sağlığımı ve kendimi iyi hissetmemi önemsiyorum, geçmişte yaşadığım gibi tehlikeli ve kontrolsüz davranışlardan uzak duruyorum."
"O günlerde, kendime ve çevreme yaptığım zararın farkında değildim, ancak şimdi sağlıklı bir yaşam sürmenin ve sorumluluk sahibi olmanın önemini anlıyorum."
"Çoğunda yan etkilerim vardı ve yan etkileri nedeniyle onları almayı bıraktım. En son denediğim Fluoxitine idi, bu da bana hiçbir dikkat çekici yan etki vermedi. Bu yüzden devam ediyorum ve gerçekten bana yardımcı oluyor."
"Çoğu antidepresan bana kötü yan etkiler verdi, bu yüzden onları kullanmayı bıraktım."
Birkaç ilaç denedim ama hepsi çok rahatsız edici yan etkilerle geldi.
"Fluoxitine kullanan ilk birkaç hafta hafif baş dönmesi yaşadım, ama şimdi artık hissetmiyorum."
Doktorum bana Fluoxitine'nin yan etkilerinin hafif olacağını söyledi ve haklı çıktı.
Bu ilaçları denemeden önce sürekli yorgunluk ve uyku hali yaşıyordum ama Fluoxitine sayesinde çok daha iyi hissediyorum.
"Adetimden 10-7 gün öncesinin nasıl hissettirdiğini bile açıklayamıyorum. Delilik, temelde."
"Her ay adet dönemimden önceki birkaç gün boyunca kendimi tanıyamaz hale geliyorum, sanki bir başka varlık gibi."
"Adet dönemimden önceki haftanın nasıl geçtiğini anlatamam, her şey bulanık ve kontrolsüz."
"Adet olmadan önceki günlerdeki ruh halimi ve davranışlarımı açıklamak imkansız, gerçekten delilik."
"Sanki bedenim benimle savaş halindeymiş gibi hissediyorum, özellikle adet dönemimden önceki 10-7 gün."
"Adet öncesi sendromunun etkisi altındayken, her şey kaotik ve ben tamamen kendimden geçmiş gibi hissediyorum."
Sosyal olarak geri çekilmeye başlıyorum ve aile / arkadaşlara geri bir metin oluşturmak için enerji almak bile fiziksel ve zihinsel olarak çok yorucu geliyor.
"Son zamanlarda sosyalleşmekten kaçınıyorum, hatta aile ve arkadaşlara geri dönüş mesajı yazmak bile bana çok yorucu geliyor."
Sosyal ortamlardan uzaklaşmaya başladım ve yakınlarıma mesaj yazacak enerjiyi bile bulmakta zorlanıyorum.
"Enerjim azalıyor ve sosyalleşmekten uzaklaşmak, hatta aile ve arkadaşlara cevap vermek bile zor geliyor."
Kendime çekilmeye başlıyorum ve en yakınlarıma bile cevap yazacak gücü bulamıyorum.
"Sosyal ortamlardan uzaklaştıkça, yakınlarıma bile mesaj yazmak zorlaşmaya başladı."
Hem kanama hem de yumurtlama sırasında PMDD'nin yanı sıra şiddetli ağrı çekiyorum.
PMDD'nin neden olduğu ağrı hem kanamalar sırasında hem de yumurtlama sırasında beni gerçekten çok etkiliyor.
"Sadece PMS değil, aynı zamanda PMDD de yaşıyorum ve bu da kanama ve yumurtlama sırasında dayanılmaz ağrılara sebep oluyor."
Kanama ve yumurtlama sırasında PMDD'nin neden olduğu ağrı o kadar şiddetli ki günlük hayatımı etkiliyor.
"Bu PMDD gerçekten çok zorlu bir durum, hem kanama hem de yumurtlama sırasında dayanılmaz ağrılar çekiyorum."
PMDD'nin kanama ve yumurtlama sırasında getirdiği ağrıları hiçbir şeyle karşılaştıramıyorum.
Yorgunluk ve bitkinlik yüzünden bu hafta hiç çalışmadım.
"Bu hafta çok yorgunum, hiçbir şey yapmaya gücüm yok."
"Yorgunluktan kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum, bu hafta hiçbir işe konsantre olamadım."
"Yorgunluğun pençesindeyim, bu hafta çalışmak mümkün değil."
Bitkinlikten dolayı bu hafta işlere hiç vaktim olmadı.
"Yorgunluktan yataktan kalkmak bile zor, bu hafta çalışmaya ne zaman vakit bulacağım bilmiyorum."
Ben de PMDD'den muzdaripim ve farklı kadınlarda PMDD semptomları hakkında çok şey okudum.
PMDD'nin ne kadar zorlayıcı olduğunu tahmin edebiliyorum çünkü ben de onunla boğuşuyorum ve diğer kadınların deneyimlerini okuyunca kendimi yalnız hissetmiyorum.
"PMDD'nin semptomları kişiye göre çok farklı olabilir, bu yüzden diğer kadınların neler yaşadığını okumak oldukça yararlı."
"PMDD, çoğu zaman kadınlar tarafından anlaşılmayan bir hastalık ve bu yüzden diğer kadınların deneyimleri hakkında okumak, daha az yalnız hissetmeme yardımcı oluyor."

"PMDD, hayatımı oldukça etkiliyor, bu yüzden başka kadınların da benzer deneyimler yaşadığını bilmek rahatlatıcı."
"Sanki birisi önümü ve arkamı bıçaklıyor ve büküyormuş gibi hissettiriyor... 11 yaşımdayken gerçekten kötü dönem ağrısı çektiğim zaman ile neredeyse aynı hissettim, bu da beni ikiye katladı ve ölüyormuşum gibi gözlerimi ağlattı."
"Ağrımın yoğunluğu, vücudumun parçalanıyormuş gibi hissetmeme neden oluyor."
"Sanki vücudumun içine bıçaklar saplanmış gibi, nefes alamayacak kadar acı çekiyorum."
"Bu acı o kadar dayanılmaz ki, neredeyse kendimi kaybediyorum, sanki bedenim beni terk etmeye hazırlanıyormuş gibi."
"Ağrı, beni büküp katlayacak kadar güçlü, sanki içimden bir ateş geçiyor gibi."
"Her nefes alışım, her hareket, bedenime işkence ediyor gibi hissettiriyor, bu acı dayanılmaz."

"İntihara meyilli thoights/SH semptomlarımla topallamak için bir psikiyatriste görünmem gerektiği söylendi. Doktorlarıma im trans, im bu konuda endişeli olduğunu söylemedim. Özellikle bu bağlamda, ne yapmam gerektiği konusunda idk. 11 yaşımdan beri dönemimden birçok sorunlu semptomum var."
"İntihara meyilli düşüncelerim ve SH semptomlarımla başa çıkabilmek için bir uzmana görünmem gerektiği söylendi, ancak doktora trans olduğumu ve bu konuda endişeli olduğumu söyleyemedim."
"Trans olduğumu ve bunu saklamanın bana çok zor geldiğini doktoruma söyleyemedim, bu yüzden SH semptomlarımı ve intihar düşüncelerimi nasıl ele almam gerektiğini bilmiyorum."
"Doktorlar intihar eğilimlerimi ve SH semptomlarımı tedavi etmek için bir psikiyatriste görünmemi öneriyor, ancak bu konuda trans olduğumu onlara söyleyemedim. Ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Psikiyatriste görünmem gerektiği söylendi, ama trans olduğumu ve bu konuda endişeli olduğumu doktoruma söyleyemedim. Şimdi ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"İntihara meyilli düşüncelerim ve SH semptomlarımla başa çıkmak için yardım almam gerektiği söylendi, ancak doktora trans olduğumu söylemekten korkuyorum. Bu yüzden ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"İki kez ağladım, partnerime birden çok kez vurdum, sert ilaçlar yapmak istiyorum, cansız hissetme hissine sahibim. Aslında yapmayacağım ama duygular orada ve beni korkutuyor."
"Bu karanlık düşünceler beni korkutuyor, yapmayacağım biliyorum ama varlığımın gerçeği bu."
"Kendimi kaybediyormuş gibi hissediyorum, sanki kontrolü kaybetmek üzereymişim gibi."
"Bu acıyı hissetmemek için hiçbir şeyden çekinmiyorum, sanırım bu yüzden kötü hissediyorum."
"Bu düşüncelerin beni ele geçirmesinden korkuyorum, umarım biri beni anlar ve durdurur."
"Partnerime karşı şiddetli hissediyorum ve bu hisler beni korkutuyor, yardım almalıyım."
"Dün yorgunluk bana çarptı ve gün boyunca herhangi bir noktada uyuyabildiğimi hissediyorum, ancak gerçekten uyuyamıyorum. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla bir zombi gibi hissediyorum."
"Dün tüm gün kendimi yorgun hissettim, sanki her an uyuyabilirmişim gibi, ama uyuyamıyorum. "
Yorgunluğun üzerime çöktüğü bir gündü. Uykuya dalmak için can atıyorum ama gözlerim açık kalmaya devam ediyor.
"Öyle yorgunum ki, sanki vücudum uyumak için çabalıyormuş gibi hissediyorum, ama uyanık kalmaya çalışıyorum. "
"Dün kendimi bitkin hissettim, uyuyamadım ama bir yandan da uyumak için can atıyordum."
"Yorgunluk üzerime çöktü, uyumam gerektiğini hissediyorum ama bedenim direnç gösteriyor."
"Menstrüasyona başladığımdan beri PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum... korkunç panik ataklar, zayıflatıcı depresyon ve si....onlara tamamen uyuştum... Ben ve her zaman yalnızdım, korkunç bir çocukluk geçirdim ve destek için herhangi bir aile ve bana bakan kimse yok. Gerçekten ne kadar daha fazla acı çekebileceğimi bilmiyorum. Ruh sağlığımın ne kadar kırılgan olduğu için ilaç denemekten çok korkuyorum."
"PMDD'nin getirdiği yoğun duygusal iniş çıkışlar ve yalnızlık hissi beni çok yordu, kendimi güçsüz ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Panik ataklar ve depresyonun pençesinde mücadele ederken, ailemden uzak ve yalnız hissediyorum, onlara olan ihtiyacımı hissediyorum."
"Yaşadığım zorluklar, geçmişte yaşadığım travmaların ve yalnızlığın yaralarını yeniden açıyor, kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Korkunç bir çocukluğun izleri ve PMDD'nin getirdiği zorluklarla mücadele etmek çok yorucu, artık ne kadar daha dayanabileceğimi bilmiyorum."
"İlaç tedavisine başlama konusunda tereddütlerim var, çünkü ruh sağlığımın ne kadar kırılgan olduğunu bildiğim için daha da kötüleşeceğinden korkuyorum."
Her ay PMDD belirtileri yaşıyorum ama bu ay deliriyormuşum gibi hissediyorum! Hamile olmadığımdan emin olmak için bu hafta her gün kontrol ettim. Adetimden önceki endişenin beni her yere götürdüğü açıktır.
"PMDD belirtileri her ay beni çok zorluyor, ancak bu ay her şey çok ağır, resmen delireceğimi hissediyorum!"
"Bu ay PMDD belirtileriyle başa çıkmak gerçekten zor, sanki her şey beni alt etmeye çalışıyor."
"Her ay PMDD yüzünden endişe ve huzursuzluk yaşıyorum, bu ay ise her şey çok daha kötü. Adetimden önce bu endişe beni tamamen ele geçiriyor."
"Bu ay PMDD'nin etkisiyle her zamankinden daha kötü hissediyorum, resmen çıldıracağım gibi hissediyorum. Adetim gecikmesin diye bu hafta sürekli test yapıyorum."
"Adetimden önceki haftalar zaten endişe dolu geçiyor, ama bu ay PMDD belirtileri her şeyi daha da kötüleştirdi, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"PMDD belirtilerim, aç kaldığım zamanlara benzer, örneğin sinirlilik"
"PMDD belirtilerim, depresif hissetmeyle de benzer şekilde ortaya çıkıyor."
"PMDD'nin etkisi, uykusuz kaldığım gecelere benziyor."
"Aşırı yorgunluk, PMDD'nin en kötü belirtilerinden biri, tıpkı migren ağrıları gibi."
"PMDD belirtileri, yoğun bir çalışma gününün sonuna benziyor, yorgun ve tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Benim için PMDD, yoğun bir duygusal fırtına gibi, hiçbir şeyin kontrolümde olmadığı hissi veriyor."
"Belirtilerim arasında bu aşırı hırıltılı öfke hissi var, o zaman sadece hiçbir yerde ağlamak istemiyormuşum gibi üzülüyorum. Kocamın etrafında olmak beni rahatsız ediyor. Ruh halimde olduğumda ve bunu ona ifade ediyorum çünkü neredeyse kafasını ısırıyorum, bir savaşa dönüşüyor."
"Son zamanlarda öfkemi kontrol altında tutamıyorum, sonra da nedensiz bir şekilde kendimi kötü hissediyorum, ağlamak istiyorum ama ağlayamıyorum."
"Kocamın yanındayken kendimi garip hissediyorum, öfkemin kontrolünü kaybettiğimde ve bunu ona söylediğimde, aramızda kavga çıkıyor."
"Şu anki ruh halim yüzünden sürekli öfkeli hissediyorum, sonra da nedensiz bir şekilde kendimi kötü hissediyorum."
"Kocamın varlığı beni rahatsız ediyor, öfkemi kontrol edemediğim zamanlarda ona karşı çok sert davranıyorum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemediğim zamanlarda kocamın etrafında olmak bana çok zor geliyor, öfkemle ilgili sorunlarım nedeniyle onunla kavga ediyorum."
bu yaşamak değil
"Bu, insanca yaşamak değil."
Böyle bir hayat yaşamak değil.
"Bu, yaşamak olarak nitelendirilemez."
Gerçek anlamda yaşamak değil bu.
Bunu yaşamak diye adlandırmak mümkün değil.
"Adetimden 10-7 gün önce normalden daha fazla... korkunç anksiyete/depresif bölüm içiyordum....alkol beni depresyona sokuyor ve semptomlarım daha da kötüleşiyor... Kaygı, öfke vb. hissediyorum."
"Adet dönemimin yaklaşmasıyla birlikte, normalden daha yoğun bir kaygı ve depresyon hissediyorum. Bu dönemde kendimi daha kırılgan ve hassas hissediyorum."
"Adet döngümün başlamasına yaklaşırken, sinirlerim bozuluyor ve moralim çöküyor. Özellikle alkol tüketimi, bu hisleri daha da artırıyor."
"Son zamanlarda, adetimden 10-7 gün önce kaygılarım ve depresyonum çok daha ağırlaşıyor. Kendimi kontrol edemediğim hissediyor ve öfke patlamaları yaşıyorum."
"Adet döngümün bu belirli döneminde, normalden daha fazla kaygı ve depresyon yaşıyorum. Alkol tüketimi ise durumu daha da kötüleştiriyor."
"Bu dönemlerde yoğun bir ruhsal değişim geçiriyorum. Kaygı, depresyon, öfke, bunların hepsi birden üzerime geliyor. Adetimden önce bu durumlar daha da şiddetleniyor."
"O kadar minnettar ve minnettardım ve neşe doluydum (mantıksızca) ve bugün ölüm hakkında müdahaleci düşüncelere sahip olmaya başladım... bu onu daha az gerçek yapmıyor, biliyor musun? Ve hissediyorum çünkü bu benim döngümle ilgili, tam olarak kibar bir konuşma değil, bu beni son derece yalnız bırakıyor. Gerçekten beynimin aksak olduğunu ve bunu durdurmak için hiçbir şey yapamayacağımı bilmem adil değil."
"Bir yandan neşe dolu, bir yandan ölüm düşüncesiyle boğuşuyorum. Bu durum, aslında ölümü daha gerçek kılıyor."
"İçimde bir mutluluk, bir minnettarlık fırtınası kopuyor ama bir yandan da ölümün gelip beni bu mutluluktan koparabileceği düşüncesi beni ürpertiyor."
Bu döngüden çıkmak istiyorum ama bu duyguyu kontrol edebildiğimi düşünmüyorum. Bu düşüncelerden kurtulmak için yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok.
"Sanki beynimde bir çelişki var, bir yandan hayatın güzelliğine kapılıp gidiyorum, bir yandan da ölümle yüzleşmekten korkuyorum."
Ölümün gerçekliğiyle yüzleşmek zorunda kalmak beni son derece yalnız hissettiriyor. Bu yalnızlığı aşmak için ne yapabileceğimi bilmiyorum.
"Bugün PMDD'mle garip bir atak ve bir tür bölüm geçiriyorum. Titrek ve terli hissediyorum, sonra bir tür anksiyete krizi geçirdim. Sıcak hissediyorum, kramplarım o kadar acı vermiyor ama sadece rahatsız edici bir baskı hissediyorum ve popomun da baskı altında olduğunu hissediyorum. Ayrıca banyoya gitmem gerekiyor gibi bir his almaya devam ediyorum ama yok. Ve şimdi de kendimi yorgun hissediyorum."
"Bugün PMDD'nin beni çok yorduğunu hissediyorum, sinirlerim bozuldu, vücudumda tuhaf bir ağrı var, bu hisse nasıl dayanacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Sanki her şey bir anda üzerime geliyor, vücudumdaki her bir hücre sanki bir savaş halinde, tüm bu fiziksel ve ruhsal ağrılara nasıl katlanacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Bugün gerçekten kötü hissediyorum, kendimi çok yorgun, tükenmiş ve baş edemez gibi hissediyorum, vücudumda hissettiğim her şey çok rahatsız edici."
"Önceden PMDD'nin bu kadar kötüleşeceğini bilseydim daha iyi hazırlanırdım, kendimi bir savaş alanında hissediyorum, her şey acı veriyor, hiçbir şeyin üstesinden gelemiyorum."
"Vücudumun bana karşı olduğunu hissediyorum, her şey ağrıyor, terliyorum, kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum, sadece uyumak istiyorum."
"Her şey çok gürültülü, parlak, karanlık, yanlış doku ve yumuşaklık, kendi giysilerimin içi beni üzüyor, mantıksız sinir bozucu ve üzgün... özellikle adetimden birkaç gün önce."
"Her şey çok gürültülü, yoğun ve karmaşık, kendimle bile baş edemiyorum, özellikle de bugünlerde kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum."
"Her şey çok hızlı, çok yoğun ve çok fazla, kafamı toplamakta zorlanıyorum, kendimden bile bıktım."
"Çevremdeki her şey beni boğuyor, duyularım aşırı yükleniyor, sanki kendi bedenim bile bana yabancılaşmış gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu gürültü, bu ışıklar, bu kalabalık... Hepsi çok fazla, kendimi bir labirentte gibi hissediyorum, çıkış yolunu bulamıyorum."
"Her şey çok kaotik, çok belirsiz, çok yorucu... Benim de kendimi toparlamam, kendimden bir parça bulmam gerekiyor, ama zor."
Belirtilerim adetimden bir hafta önce başlar ve adetim neredeyse bitene kadar bitmez.
Adet dönemimden bir hafta önce başlayan belirtilerim neredeyse adetim bitene kadar sürer.
"Adet başlangıcından bir hafta önce başlayan belirtilerim, adetim bitmek üzereyken bile devam eder."
"Adet dönemimin başlamasından bir hafta önce başlayan belirtilerim, adetim sona erene kadar neredeyse hiç durmaz."
Adet olmadan bir hafta önce başlayan belirtilerim adetim bitene kadar devam eder.
Adet öncesi belirtilerim bir hafta öncesinden başlayıp neredeyse adetim bitene kadar devam eder.
Bu sefer kesmedim ama uyluğumu yaraladım ve öfkeden bir doku kutusunu yırttım. Çok deli hissetmekten nefret ediyorum... Kendimi tam bir başarısızlık gibi hissediyorum. Ölmek istiyorum
"Bugün yine her şey ters gitti. Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, sanki her şey bana karşıymış gibi."
Çok sinirlendiğimde kendimi durduramıyorum. Her şey parçalanıyor ve ben her şeyi mahvediyorum.
"Bu öfke beni tüketiyor. Her şeyden bıktım, herkesten bıktım."
"İşte yine aynı senaryo. Kontrolü kaybediyorum, her şey dağılıyor ve kendimi başarısız hissediyorum."
"Kendimi harap hissediyorum. Bu duygu beni yiyip bitiriyor, her şeyden vazgeçmek istiyorum."
Her zaman kahvaltıyı atlayan ve akşam 3 ya da 4'e kadar yemek yemeyen biri oldum. Yemekleri atlayarak PMDD ile hayatımı ne kadar kötü hale getirdiğimi fark etmem yıllar aldı.
"Yemek yemek benim için hep ikinci planda kaldı, sabahları kahvaltımı atlamak ve öğlen geç saatlerde yemek yemek benim rutinim haline gelmişti."
"Yemek düzensizliği, özellikle de kahvaltıyı atlayıp gün boyunca yemek yemeden geçirmek, PMDD belirtilerimi artırdığını fark etmem uzun zaman aldı."
Yıllarca öğünleri atlamayı normal karşıladım ve kendimi her zaman çok yorgun ve dengesiz hissettiğimi düşünüyordum.
"Bedenim bana ne söylediğini anlamak ve dinlemek uzun zamanımı aldı, ancak düzenli beslenmenin sağlığım üzerinde büyük etkisi olduğunu fark ettim."
"Aslında yemek yemeyi önemsememek ve kendimi yeterince beslememek, PMDD'nin günlük hayatımı nasıl etkilediğinin en büyük nedenlerinden biri olduğunu öğrendim."
"Kanatlardan Oreos'a, burgerlerden brownilere kadar her şeyi arzuluyorum. Sıcak bir karmaşa. Umutsuz hissediyorum."
"Tatlılardan tuzlulara, içeceklerden atıştırmalıklara kadar her şeyi yemek istiyorum. Midem guruluyor. Çok açım."
"Dondurmadan çerezlere, pizza'dan keklere kadar her şeyi özlüyorum. Çok iştahım var. Açlığımı bastıramam."
"Kahveden çikolataya, meyvelerden sebzelere kadar her şeyden bir parça istiyorum. Karnım zil çalıyor. Yiyecek özlemi çekiyorum."
"Turtadan kurabiyelere, salatalardan makarnalara kadar her şeyi düşünmek bile beni mutlu ediyor. Ağzım sulandı. Çok yiyebilirim."
"Patates kızartmasından tavuk nuggets'lara, dondurmadan meyve salatasına kadar her şey çekici görünüyor. İsteklerim artıyor. Midem çok boş."
"Çok kilo aldım, bir yaralanmadan kurtuldum, doğum yaptım ve sonra PMDD geliştirdim. Cehennem haftalarında etrafta olmak kolay olmadığını biliyorum ama terapi, ilaç tedavisi yaptım ve çocuğumuz ve ailemiz için elimden gelen her şeyi yapıyorum.... Suçlu hissediyorum, çirkin, sevgiye ya da zamana layık değilim. Çok üzgünüm ve kızgınım."
"Son zamanlarda çok şey yaşadım, kilo aldım, yaralandım, doğum yaptım ve şimdi de PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum."
"Her şey bir anda üzerime geldi, bir anda kilo aldım, bir yaralanmadan kurtuldum, doğum yaptım ve şimdi de PMDD ile uğraşıyorum."
"Hayat beni gerçekten zorluyor, kilo aldım, bir yaralanma geçirdim, doğum yaptım ve şimdi de PMDD ile başa çıkmaya çalışıyorum."
"Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak çok zorlu bir dönem geçiriyorum, kilo aldım, bir yaralanma atlattım, doğum yaptım ve şimdi de PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum."
"Çok şeyle mücadele ediyorum, kilo aldım, bir yaralanma geçirdim, doğum yaptım ve şimdi de PMDD'den dolayı çok zor zamanlar geçiriyorum."
Yasal bir zihinsel çöküntü geçirdiğimde kalemime vuracağım ve o zaman gerçekten iyiyim. Evet gibi hala üzgünüm ama en azından şimdi biraz işlevsel üzgünüm
"Yasal bir zihinsel çöküntü geçirdiğimde kendimi biraz toparlamak için meditasyon yapıyorum, işe yarıyor."
"Her şey çok kötü olduğunda, biraz müzik dinliyorum ve o zaman daha iyi hissediyorum, yine de her zaman üzgünüm."
"Hayat beni çok üzdüğünde, kendimi biraz sakinleştirmek için yürüyüşe çıkıyorum, kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum."
"Başım çok kötü olduğunda biraz uykudan sonra,  hep daha iyi hissederim, ama yine de üzgünüm."
Gerçekten kötü hissettiğimde iyi bir film izliyorum ve kendimi biraz daha iyi hissediyorum.
"Adet dönemime kadar geçen hafta çok öfkeliyim. Her küçük şey beni sinirlendiriyor ve öfkemin dışarı çıkmasına izin veremediğim için onu depoluyorum ve günün sonunda çok yorgunum ve öfkemi dışarı çıkaramıyorum, bu yüzden sadece ağlıyorum ve ağlıyorum."
"Adet dönemim yaklaşırken her zaman çok hassas oluyorum, sanki vücudum bana karşı savaş açmış gibi."
"Son birkaç gündür sinirlerim bozulmuş durumda, en ufak şey bile beni çileden çıkarıyor."
"Her şey beni sinirlendiriyor, öfkemi içime atıp duruyorum ama bir yerden sonra dayanacak gücüm kalmıyor."
"Bu hafta her şey çok zor, adetime yakın olduğum için sanırım duygusal olarak çok hassasım."
"Adet dönemim yaklaşırken kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, her şey beni sinirlendirdiği için sadece ağlayabiliyorum."
Her ay acı çekiyor.
"Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşıyor, sanki bir döngüde sıkışmış gibi."
"Acı ona her ay yeniden geliyor, bir türlü kaçamıyor."
"Her ay aynı acıyla karşılaşıyor, ne yapacağını bilmiyor."
"Aylık olarak aynı acıyı hissediyor, sanki bir lanet gibi."
"Her ay gelen bu acıdan kurtulmayı çok istiyor, ama yapabileceği bir şey yok."
"Ya o kadar endişeliyim ki, Valium'umla bile bütün gün panik atak geçiriyorum ya da depresyondayım SH-ing'im var ve bir daha kimsenin etrafında olmak istemiyorum. Halüsinasyon gördüm ve babamı kızdırdım / korkuttum. Onun tarafından engellendim. Bok gibi hissetmekten ve bok gibi olmaktan çok yoruldum."
"Gerçekten kötü hissediyorum. Depresyondayım, intihar düşünceleri var, kimsenin etrafında olmak istemiyorum. Artık yeter."
"Hayatım çok zor, hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor. Panik atak geçiriyorum, halüsinasyon görüyorum. Çok yorgunum."
"Endişelerim beni mahvediyor.  Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Ailemi de üzüyorum, daha fazla dayanamıyorum."
"Çok kötü hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum. Panik ataklarım ve halüsinasyonlarım beni tüketti. Daha fazla dayanamıyorum."
"Tek istediğim şey bu kötü hislerden kurtulmak. Her şeyden bıktım, kendimi yalnız ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
Bu sefer gerçekten çaresiz ve işe yaramaz hissediyordum. Her birkaç haftada bir böyle hissetmekten bıktım.
"Kendimi tamamen çaresiz ve umutsuz hissediyorum, bu durum artık dayanılmaz hale geldi."
"Bu hisleri yaşamaktan yorulduğumu, artık yeterince mücadele ettiğimi düşünüyorum."
"Tekrar aynı döngüye girmekten bıktım, kendimi çaresiz ve işe yaramaz hissediyorum."
"Her seferinde aynı duygulara kapıldığımda, umudumu kaybetmekten korkuyorum."
"Bu çaresizlik ve işe yaramazlık hissi beni tüketiyor, artık bundan kurtulmak istiyorum."
Pazar günü görünmesi gereken bir sonraki dönemim için PMS kramplarını hissediyorum. Hayal kırıklığına uğradım
Pazar günü gelecek dönemin ilk günleri için önceden sinirlenmeye başlıyorum. Hayat adil değil.
Pazar günü başlayan ve hafta sonunu mahveden dönem öncesi sendromunu hissediyorum.
Pazar gününden itibaren başlayan yeni dönemle birlikte gelen PMS'i hissediyorum. Bu acı verici.
Pazar günü başlayan yeni dönem nedeniyle PMS kramplarım başladı. Her şey çok yorucu.
"Pazar günü gelen dönemi hissederek, bir kez daha o can sıkıcı PMS belirtilerine maruz kaldığım için hayal kırıklığına uğradım."
"Bu ilaçta cinsel dürtüm yok, anksiyete, depresyon, pmdd, depresif, endişeli semptomlar şimdi tam gaz geri döndü"
"Bu ilaç bana iyi gelmedi, cinsel dürtüm geri geldi ve şimdi anksiyete, depresyon ve PMDD semptomları da arttı."
"İlacın yan etkileri çok kötü, cinsel dürtüm yok oldu ve şimdi anksiyete, depresyon ve PMDD semptomları tekrar başladı."
"İlacın olumlu etkisi geçici gibi görünüyor, cinsel dürtüm geri geldi ve anksiyete, depresyon ve PMDD semptomları da geri döndü."
"Bu ilacı bırakmam gerekecek gibi duruyor, cinsel dürtüm hiç yok ve şimdi anksiyete, depresyon ve PMDD semptomları çok kötü."
"İlaç bana hiç fayda etmedi, aksine cinsel dürtümü yok etti ve şimdi anksiyete, depresyon ve PMDD semptomları da arttı."
Onunla savaşmak yerine hormonların dalgalarıyla akmaya çalışıyorum ve olamayacağım zamanlarda en iyi durumda olmaya çalışıyorum. Ya luteal'e bir adım geri atacağımız ve tüm zor duyguları hissedeceğimiz zaman olarak baksaydık?
"Onunla sürekli kavga etmek yerine, kendi duygusal dalgalanmalarımı kabullenmeye ve olabildiğince sakin kalmaya çalışıyorum."
"Belki de bu duygusal iniş çıkışlar, bedenimizin bize bir şey söylemek istediğinin bir işaretidir. Bu zorlu zamanlara biraz daha anlayışla yaklaşabilir miyiz?"
"Eğer bu hormonal dalgalanmalar bir fırtınaysa, ben de fırtınanın ortasında sığınak arayan bir gemi gibiyim. Bu fırtına geçene kadar sakin kalmaya çalışıyorum."
"En zor anlarda bile, kendimi kontrol altında tutmak ve sakin kalmaya çalışmak en iyisi. Belki de bu durumun üstesinden gelmenin en iyi yolu budur."
Bu duygusal dalgalanmaların sadece bir dönem olduğunu hatırlamak önemli. Her şey geçecek ve ben de eski haline döneceğim.
Duş alırken ve nedensel olarak benim bir boşluk israfı olduğumu ve hiçbir şeyin bir daha doğru olmayacağını düşünmeye başlarken
"Duş alırken, boşuna yaşadığımı ve hiçbir şeyin bir daha yoluna girmeyeceğini düşünmeye başlıyorum."
"Duşta durup neden var olduğumu sorgulamadan edemiyorum, hiçbir şeyin bir daha iyi olmayacağını düşünüyorum."
Suyun üzerimde akmasıyla birlikte hayatımın boş olduğunu ve hiçbir şeyin bir daha düzelmeyeceğini hissediyorum.
"Sıcak suyun altında düşüncelerim de kayboluyor, bir hiçliğin içindeymiş gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şeyin düzelmeyeceği fikriyle boğuşuyorum."
"Duşun altında, hayatın anlamını sorgularken kendimi bir boşluk içinde buluyorum, hiçbir şeyin eskisi gibi olmayacağı düşüncesiyle boğuşuyorum."
"ilişkimde en çok tezahür eder (güven sorunları, ilişkiden şüphe etmek, duygularımdan şüphe etmek, çok kötü ve kötü olmak, vb.)... Son derece stresli oluyorum ve tüm dünyamın üzerime çöktüğünü ve hiçbir çıkış yolu olmadığını hissediyorum. OKB oldukça kötüleşiyor gibi görünüyor, bir temizlik rampasına çıkıyorum, kağıt havluların yerleştirilmesi kelimenin tam anlamıyla beni rahatsız edecek. Sonra tabii ki tüm bunların üzerine intihar fikirleri başlıyor."
"İlişkimdeki güvensizlik ve şüpheler, hayatımı alt üst ediyor. Her şey çok yoğun ve kontrol edilemez hissettiriyor."
"Okb'nin kötüleşmesi beni tüketiyor, her şeyin mükemmel olması gerektiği düşüncesiyle bunalıyorum. Neredeyse delireceğimi hissediyorum."
"İlişki problemlerim, duygusal iniş çıkışlarım ve kendime olan güvensizliğim, her şeyi daha da kötüleştiriyor. Bu karanlık düşüncelerden kurtulmak için çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Her şey, ilişkimdeki güven sorunlarından kaynaklanan anksiyete ve şüphelerle birleşince, kendimi tamamen çaresiz hissediyorum. Çıkış yolu bulabileceğimden emin değilim."
Okb'nin artması ve intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşmak benim için çok zor. Bu durumdan nasıl kurtulacağımı bilmiyorum.
"Bir dükkanda 3 dev resim de dahil olmak üzere tüm gün boyunca bir şeyler çaldım ve bu çok utanç vericiydi. Sıcak sos şişemi devirdim ve ayak parmağıma düştü. Kedi maması kutularını koyuyordum, hepsini düşürdüm."
"Bugün dükkanda kötü davranışlarda bulundum, 3 büyük resim de dahil olmak üzere bir sürü şey çaldım ve bu beni çok utançlandırdı."
"Her zaman dükkanda yaramazlık yaparım ama bugün özellikle kötüydü, dev resimler dahil birçok şey çaldım ve bunu yapmaktan çok utandım."
"Dükkanlarda alışveriş yaparken çok dağınık biriyim, bugün dev resimler çaldım ve bir sıcak sos şişesini düşürdüm, çok utanç vericiydi."
"Bugün çok beceriksiz davrandım, dev resimler çalıp sıcak sos şişesini düşürdüm, ayrıca kedi maması kutularını da düşürdüm."
"Dükkanlarda yaramazlık yapmak eğlenceli ama bugün alışılmadık bir şekilde beceriksiz davrandım, dev resimler çaldım, sıcak sos şişesini düşürdüm, kedi maması kutularını da düşürdüm ve bu yüzden çok utandım."
Ayın sadece bir hafta dışında normal hissediyorum. Ayın geri kalanı... Sanırım ne kadar korkunç olduklarını açıklamama bile gerek yok. Geçen Çarşamba'dan beri 7/24 uykuluyum... Temel yaşam görevlerini bile yapmak çok çaba gerektiriyor.
"Ayın çoğu zaman kendim gibi hissetmiyorum, sadece bir hafta boyunca normal gibi hissediyorum."
Gerçekten kötü hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor ve bu zamanlar çoğunlukla ayın belirli bir zamanına denk geliyor.
Bir hafta dışında her zaman çok yorgun ve bitkin hissediyorum.
"Bazen o kadar kötü hissediyorum ki, temel yaşam görevlerini yapmak bile zor oluyor."
"Ayın belirli zamanlarında kendimi çok iyi hissetmiyorum, sanki tüm enerjim boşalmış gibi."
"Geç ergenliğimden beri adet migreni yaşadım, DEHB, Hipotiroidizm (Hashimoto's) ve otoimmün artritten şüpheleniyorum ve hipomani, anksiyete, uykusuzluk ve bipolar benzeri ruh hali istikrarsızlığı gibi PMDD semptomları yaşıyorum. Norethindrone'u denedikten sonra, uyku, anksiyete ve cinsel dürtüde iyileşmeler fark ettim, ancak yine de migren, düzensiz dönemler ve saç incelmesi yaşadı."
Çoklu sağlık sorunuyla boğuşuyorum ve uzun zamandır bu sorunlarla mücadele ediyorum.
Ergenlikten beri çeşitli hastalıklara sahip olduğumun farkındayım ve bununla başa çıkmak için mücadele ediyorum.
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak birçok zorlukla karşı karşıyayım, kendimi iyi hissetmek için çaba gösteriyorum."
Hormonal dengesizliklerden kaynaklanan birçok sağlık sorunu yaşıyorum ve bu sorunları çözmek için çabalıyorum.
Hem fiziksel hem de mental olarak zorlu bir yolculuktan geçiyorum ve bu zorlukların üstesinden gelmeye çalışıyorum.
"Dün yatağında çürüdü, ağladı ve çok üzgündü. Kesinlikle hiçbir motivasyonu yoktu.... Yaklaşık bir saat önce kramplardan ve migrenden dolayı çok fazla acı çekerek uyandım ve bu da beni midemi bulandırıyor ve ışığa ve sese karşı hassas hale getiriyor."
"Bugün kendimi son derece kötü hissediyorum, her şey beni rahatsız ediyor."
"Bir hafta boyunca hasta olduğum için hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, yorgunum ve halsizim."
"Midem çok bulanıyor ve başım dönüyor, evden çıkmaya bile gücüm yok."
"Kendimi çok hasta hissediyorum ve sadece uyumak istiyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Gözlerim çok ağrıyor ve başım çok kötü, sanki beynim patlayacak gibi."
"Kaygıyla donmuş ve uyumaya çalışıyor, ara sıra burada ve orada bir şeyler yapıyor ama tüm zaman boyunca endişe ve kendinden nefret etmekle doluyor."
"Uykuya dalmak için çabalıyor ama içindeki huzursuzluk onu uyuşturuyor, sürekli bir telaş ve kendini eleştirme hissiyle boğuşuyor."
"Kaygı, onu bir örtü gibi sarıp sarmalamış, uykuya dalmak için çabalıyor ama bu duygu onu rahatsız ederek, uykusunu sürekli olarak bölüyor."
"Her şeye rağmen uyumaya çalışıyor ama kaygısı onun için bir engel, kendini suçlu hissediyor ve sürekli bir huzursuzluk içinde."
"Uykuya dalmak için mücadele ederken, kaygı ve öz eleştiri onu rahatsız ediyor, bir türlü rahatlayamıyor."
"Uykuya dalmak için çabalıyor, ancak zihni sürekli olarak kaygı ve öz eleştiri düşünceleriyle dolu, bu da onu uyanık tutuyor."
PMDD beynimi rehin tutuyor ve bana bilişsel olarak bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu hissettiriyor. Düşüncelerimi iletmek ve başka bir zaman benim için kolay olacağı zaman küçük şeyleri hatırlamak her zaman çok zor. Sadece düşünmemi engelleyen ve berbat olan bu bulut var.
"PMDD, odaklanmamı ve işlevsel olmamı çok zorlaştırıyor, sanki zihnimde sisli bir bulut varmış gibi."
"PMDD nedeniyle kendimi sürekli olarak zihinsel olarak bulanık ve karışık hissediyorum, en temel şeyleri bile yapmakta zorlanıyorum."
"Sanki beyin fonksiyonum PMDD tarafından ele geçirilmiş gibi, günlük görevleri yerine getirmek bile imkansız hale geliyor."
"Beynimin PMDD nedeniyle bulanıklaşması, düşüncelerimi toplamak ve konuşmak için çok fazla çaba gerektiği anlamına geliyor."
"PMDD, zihnime bir sis perdesi çekmiş gibi, odaklanmak ve düzgün düşünmek imkansız hale geliyor."
"O kadar endişeli ve suçlu hissediyorum ki, insanlar etrafımda rahatsız hissediyorlar... Sadece somurtuyorum ve kronik dinleniyor orospu suratım var. Ne kadar duygusal, yorgun ve endişeli hissettiğimi gizlemeye çalışıyorum."
"Kendimi sürekli kötü hissediyorum, sanki etrafımdakilere kötü bir enerji veriyorum."
"İnsanlarla konuşurken ne söyleyeceğimi bilemiyorum, sadece susuyor ve içimde çöküyorum."
"Yorgunluğum ve endişem yüzünden hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum, sadece somurtarak geçiyorum günleri."
"İnsanlarla iletişim kurmak bile yorucu geliyor, hep kendime çekilip kalmak istiyorum."
İç dünyamda büyük bir fırtına var ama dışarıya sadece sakin ve duygusuz bir yüz gösteriyorum.
"PMDD'nizi etkili bir şekilde (hatta biraz etkili) tedavi edenleriniz için, hap olmayan sizin için neyin işe yaradığını merak ediyorum."
"PMDD ile mücadele edenler için ilaç dışında hangi yöntemler işe yarıyor, merak ediyorum."
"PMDD tedavisinde hap kullanmak istemeyenler için hangi alternatif yöntemler etkili olabilir, sizin tecrübelerinizi merak ediyorum."
"PMDD'yi ilaçlarla değil de başka yöntemlerle yönetmeyi başaranlar varsa, deneyimlerini paylaşabilir mi?"
"İlaç dışında PMDD'nizi kontrol altına alan yöntemler varsa, bunları bizimle paylaşır mısınız?"
"PMDD tedavisinde ilaç kullanmak istemeyenler için etkili doğal yöntemler nelerdir, merak ediyorum."
"Semptomları alıyorum ama adet yok. Sadece şunu eklemek istiyorum, eğer buna neden olan muhtemelen buysa, sırt sırta ve idk'e çok fazla uti geçiriyorum. İdrarımda gizli kan var ve muhtemelen adetimin bozulmasına neden olan şey bu mu bilmiyorum."
"Adet görmüyorum, ama sanki vücudum bana bir şeyler anlatmaya çalışıyor. Çok fazla idrar yolu enfeksiyonu geçirdim, sırt ağrıları ve sürekli bir rahatsızlık var. Belki de bunların hepsi adetimi geciktirmenin nedeni olabilir, üstelik idrarımda gizli kan da var."
"Semptomlar var, ama adet yok. Bu seferki sorun idrar yolu enfeksiyonları gibi görünüyor. Son zamanlarda çok sık geçirdim ve sırt ağrıları da cabası. Belki de bunlar adetimin düzensiz olmasının nedenidir. Ayrıca idrarımda gizli kan var, bu da endişe verici."
"Adet bekliyordum, ama gelmedi. Bunun nedeni, sürekli idrar yolu enfeksiyonları ve sırt ağrıları olabilir. İdrarımda gizli kan da var, belki de bu da adetimin gecikmesine yol açıyor."
"Vücudum garip hareketler yapıyor. Adet yok, ama semptomlar var. Son zamanlarda sürekli idrar yolu enfeksiyonu ve sırt ağrısı çekiyorum. İdrarımda gizli kan da var, bu da adetimin düzensiz olmasının nedeni olabilir mi acaba?"
"Adet gecikti, ama vücudumda bir şeyler oluyor. Son zamanlarda idrar yolu enfeksiyonları çok sık tekrarladı ve sırt ağrıları da cabası. Ayrıca idrarımda gizli kan var. Tüm bunlar adetimi bozmuş olabilir mi?"
"2023 Mart'ından beri yorulmadan çözümler üzerinde çalışmaya başladım. Farklı doğum kontrolleri, ilaç değişiklikleri ve daha birçok şey denedim. Bana yardımcı olan şey:"
"2023 Mart'ından beri bu sorunu çözmek için sürekli uğraşıyorum, farklı yöntemler denedim, sonuçlar beklediğim gibi olmadı, fakat yılmıyorum."
"Yorulmak bilmeden çözüm bulmaya çalışıyorum, ilaç değiştirdim, doktorlara gittim, ama hala bir sonuç yok."
"Bu sorunu çözmek için ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, 2023 Mart'ından beri her yolu denedim, hala çözüm bulunamadı."
"2023 Mart'ından beri bu problemi çözmek için uğraşıyorum, birçok doktora gittim, ilaç kullandım, ama hala bir sonuç yok."
"Çözüm bulmak için 2023 Mart'ından beri çalışıyorum, farklı yöntemler denedim, ama hala bir sonuç alamadım."
Geçmişte küçük bir çocukken aşırı ruh hali değişimleri ve intihar depresyonundan muzdariptim ve her zaman vücudumdan kopmuştum... Ayrıca tutarlı bir çalışmayla çok fazla zorluk çektim ve yoğun depresyon ve yorgunluk nedeniyle neredeyse hiçbir şey yapmadığım haftalar geçirdim.
"Çocukluğumda duygusal iniş çıkışlar ve intihar düşünceleriyle boğuştum, kendimden kopmuş gibi hissediyordum."
"Aşırı ruh hali değişimleri ve derin bir umutsuzluk içinde yaşadım, hayattan kopuk ve güçsüz hissediyordum."
"İntihar düşünceleriyle mücadele ettim, kendimi tükenmiş ve dünyadan soyutlanmış hissediyordum."
"Çocukluğumun büyük bir bölümünde ruh halim sürekli değişiyordu ve kendimden uzaklaşmış gibi hissediyordum, intihar düşünceleriyle de boğuştum."
"Kendimi sık sık tükenmiş ve hayattan kopuk hissettim, ruh halim aşırı dalgalanıyordu ve intihar düşünceleriyle mücadele ediyordum."
Şu an kendimi ne kadar kötü hissettiğime inanamıyorum.
Bu kadar kötü hissedeceğimi hiç tahmin edemezdim.
Kendimi bu kadar kötü hissettiğim için gerçekten üzgünüm.
Bu kadar kötü hissetmemi beklemiyordum.
Şu anki halim inanılmaz kötü.
Bu kadar kötü hissetmemin nedenini anlamıyorum.
"'Cehennem haftası' modelim tanıdık bir intihar düşüncesiyle başlıyor, ardından uykusuzluk hissini zayıflatıyor - fiziksel olarak endişeli ve huzursuz oluyorum, ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım vücudumu uyuyacak kadar rahatlayamıyorum. Sonra dönemimden 2/3 gün önce çok paranoyak ve kuruntulu oluyorum."
"'Cehennem haftası' olarak adlandırdığım dönem, hep aynı intihar düşüncesinin gelip geçtiği bir hisle başlıyor, bunu uykusuzluk hissi takip ediyor - fiziksel olarak endişeli ve huzursuz hissediyorum, ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım vücudum rahatlamıyor."
"Her ay aynı döngüye giriyorum: önce ruh halim bozuluyor, ardından uyuyamıyorum, sonrasında da paranoya ve endişe başlıyor."
"İntihar düşünceleriyle başlayan bir hafta, uykusuzluk, endişe ve paranoyanın birleşimiyle devam ediyor, her ay aynı çileyi tekrar tekrar yaşıyorum."
"Kendimi bir ruhsal çöküşe hazırlanmış gibi hissediyorum, önce intihar düşünceleri geliyor, ardından uykusuzluk, sonra da paranoya ve endişe beni kuşatıyor."
"Bu dönem benim için bir kabus; önce intihar düşünceleri zihnimi işgal ediyor, sonra uyuyamıyorum, sonra da bir sürü kuruntu ve endişe beni sarıyor."
Sabah iki yerine bunlardan dört tane aldım ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. O zaman süper telaşlıydım.
Sabah iki yerine bunlardan dört tane aldım ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. O zaman süper telaşlıydım.
İki yerine dört tane yedim ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. Sonra bir anda her şey değişti.
Çay yerine kahve aldım ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. Sonra aniden işler karıştı.
Sabah iki saat yerine dört saat çalıştım ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. Sonra yoğun bir tempoya girdim.
"İki değil, dört tane aldım ve normal bir gün gibi hissettim. Sonra aniden işler yoğunlaştı."
Sanırım onun için çok fazlayım ve o beni idare edemez. Erkek arkadaşım için kapana kısılmış ve çok kötü hissediyorum o en iyisi ve çok iyi yapıyor ama tam da bu yüzden kendimi kötü hissediyorum.
"Onu çok fazla yoruyorum galiba, o benimle başa çıkamıyor."
"Aramızda çok büyük bir uçurum var, o benimle aynı seviyede değil."
"Benimle olmayı hak etmiyor, çünkü ben ondan çok daha fazla şey bekliyorum."
Kendimi değersiz hissediyorum çünkü o çok iyi bir insan ve ben o iyiyi hak etmiyorum.
"Birbirimizi gerçekten seviyoruz ama birlikte olmamız doğru değil, çünkü ben ona çok yük oluyorum."
"Ağlamak, ağlamak ve ağlamak istiyorum ama üzerinde olduğum antidepresanlar beni uyuşuk hissettiriyor. Her küçük rahatsızlık beni kör edici bir şekilde sinirlendiriyor ve üzüyor. Bulaşıklara ve eve dağınık bir şekilde bakmak beni panikliyor. Bu şekilde hissettiğim ve kontrolden çıktığım için kendimden nefret ediyorum, sadece herkesten kaçınmam ve tüm gün odamda kalmam gerekiyor. depresif ruh hali + kendine zarar verme fikirleri"
Ağlamak istiyorum ama duygularımı hissetmek için yeterince güçlü değilim.
Her şey beni sinirlendiriyor ve her zaman sinir bozucu bir şekilde üzgünüm.
Bulaşıkları yıkamak veya evi temizlemek gibi basit şeyler bile beni korkutuyor.
Kontrolümü kaybettiğimi hissediyorum ve bu his beni gerçekten korkutuyor.
Sadece her şeyden kaçmak ve gün boyu yatağımda kalmak istiyorum.
"Bitkin düştüm, acıktım ama çoğu yemek midemi bulandırıyor. Berbat hissediyorum."
"Yorgunluktan bittim, midem guruluyor ama hiçbir şey yemek istemiyorum. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Enerjim tamamen bitti, açım ama yemek düşüncesi bile midemi bulandırıyor. Berbat bir haldeyim."
"Yorgunluktan bittim, açım ama hiçbir şey yiyeceğim yok. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Yorgunluktan bittim, açım ama ne yediğimi düşününce midem bulanıyor. Kendimi berbat hissediyorum."
"Yorgunluktan bittim, açım ama hiçbir şey iştahımı açmıyor. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Sinirlilik, çok kolay ağlamak, özellikle şekerin bağlanmaması için aktif olarak çok çalışmam gerekiyor. Çok kısa kaynaştı. Sadece luteal fazım sırasında."
"Hormonal değişimler yüzünden çok çabuk sinirleniyorum, kolay ağlıyorum ve şekersiz yaşamaya çalışıyorum. Bu hafta özellikle kötü geçti."
"Bu dönemde sinirlilik ve duygusal iniş çıkışlar normal, sanırım her şeyin bu hormonlara bağlı olduğunu kabul etmem gerek."
Birkaç gündür kendimi çok çabuk sinirleniyor ve ağlamaklı buluyorum. Acaba luteal fazımda mıyım?
"Genel olarak kendimi biraz yorgun ve sinirli hissediyorum, ayrıca şekerden uzak durmaya çalışmak da zor oluyor. Sanırım bu hormonal dönem geçene kadar biraz daha sabır göstermem gerek."
"Duygusal olarak çok hassasım, en ufak şeylere bile sinirleniyorum ve ağlamak geliyor. Umarım bu dönem çabuk geçer."
Hormonlarım her şeyi stresli hissettirdiğinde stresimi nasıl azaltabilirim? İsteklerim bu dünyanın dışındayken nasıl daha sağlıklı yiyebilirim? Çok terlerken ve hormon değişiklikleri nedeniyle vücut sıcaklığım sürekli yükselirken nasıl iyi uyuyabilirim? Her ay hormonlarıma kukla gibi hissediyorum ve sadece 2 haftalık rahatlamam var.
"Hormonlarımın beni bir lunapark yolculuğuna bindirmesi gibi hissediyorum, sürekli iniş çıkışlarla boğuşuyorum ve kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"Hormonlarımı kontrol altına almak için ne yapabilirim, sanki her şeyi daha da kötüleştiren bir savaşın içindeymişim gibi."
"Sanki vücudumun kendine ait bir hayatı var ve bana karşı savaş açmış gibi hissediyorum, hormonlar her şeyi karmaşıklaştırıyor."
"Bu hormonal fırtınanın geçmesini ve tekrar kendimi hissetmeyi özlüyorum, her şey çok yorucu."
"Bu hormonal değişimlerin ne zaman sona ereceği hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok, sanki sürekli olarak savaş halindeymişim gibi hissediyorum."
"Dikkat ettim ve bir yıldır, asit reflüm Luteal fazı sırasında gerçekten kötüleşti ve daha sonra folloküler sırasında zayıflıyor ve gelişiyor... Ayrıca işitme testi yaptırdım. Sol kulağımda normalim, ancak luteal sırasında kulağımda bir şey çınlıyor (tininit) ve basınç nedeniyle ağrı var ve bu çok fazla duyamıyorum mu? Henüz bu sonuçlarla ilgili birincil bakım dr'imle konuşmadım..."
"Luteal fazımda asit reflümde artış, folloküler fazımda ise azalma gözlemliyorum."
"Luteal fazı boyunca kulağımda çınlama ve basınç nedeniyle ağrı hissediyorum, folloküler fazda ise bu şikayetler azalıyor."
"Asit reflüm ve işitme sorunlarımın döngümle bağlantılı olduğunu düşünüyorum, ancak doktorla görüşmem gerekiyor."
"Doktorun, luteal fazımda yaşadığım bu belirtilerin nedenini anlamak için daha fazla test isteyebileceğini düşünüyorum."
Luteal fazımda yaşanan bu rahatsızlıkların hormonlarla bağlantılı olabileceğini düşünüyorum.
"1 veya 2 gün boyunca kendimi ""yüksek"" hissediyorum, bu da doğal bir yüksek, genel bir iyi olma hissi, mutlu, olumlu, yüksek enerji ve herhangi bir müzik sesini şaşırtıcı kılıyor."
"Kendimi enerjik, mutlu ve pozitif hissediyorum, her şey harika görünüyor."
Son birkaç gündür inanılmaz bir mutluluk ve enerji dalgası yaşıyorum.
"Bu günlerde her şey daha parlak görünüyor, kendimi süper mutlu ve motive hissediyorum."
"Doğal bir enerji patlaması yaşıyorum, her şey inanılmaz derecede keyifli."
"Kendimi gerçekten iyi hissediyorum, etrafımda olup biten her şeye karşı olumlu bir bakış açım var."
"Gerçekten depresyona girmeye başladım, egzersiz yapmayı bıraktım, hayatımdaki herkesi kestim ve üzgün yalnız bir kanepe patatesi oldum. Bu, yaptığım her şeyde başarısız olduğum için kendimi cezalandırmanın bir yolu olarak yemek yemeyi bırakmama ve kalorilerimi ciddi şekilde kısıtlamama yol açıyor. Birkaç gün içinde hayal edebileceğiniz en yoğun özlemleri alıyorum ve kesinlikle abur cubur ve olmayan her şeyde çıldırıyorum ve kendimi tamamen kontrolden çıkmış hissediyorum. Bu elbette kendimi temize çıkarmama ve tamamen kendimden nefret etmeme neden oluyor."
"Depresyonun pençesindeyken, kendimi dış dünyadan soyutluyorum, sosyalleşmeyi bırakıyor, sadece evde kalıp televizyon izliyorum ve sürekli olarak yemek yeme dürtülerine kapılıyorum."
"Yaşam enerjimin azalması ve motivasyonumun kaybolmasıyla, kendimi boşluğa bırakıyorum, hiçbir şey yapmıyorum, sadece yemek yiyerek kendimi cezalandırıyorum."
"Bir boşluğa düştüğümü hissediyorum, sürekli yorgunum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece yemek yeme isteğimle baş başa kalıyorum."
"İçinde bulunduğum durumdan dolayı kendimden nefret ediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece yiyerek kendimi cezalandırıyorum."
"Her şeyden bıktım, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sadece evde kalıp yemek yiyerek zaman geçiriyorum."
Göğsüm o bölgedeki gömleklerimin gerçekten sıkı olduğu yerde daha büyük / daha geniş hissedecek
Gömleğim dar olduğunda göğsüm daha geniş hissediyor.
O bölgede gömleklerim sıkı olduğu için göğsümde genişleme hissediyorum.
Dar kıyafetler giydiğimde göğsüm daha büyük görünüyormuş gibi hissediyorum.
"Sıkı gömlekler göğsümü daha büyük gösteriyor, hissettiriyor."
Bu gömleklerin göğüs kısmı dar olduğundan göğsüm daha genişmiş gibi geliyor.
Ben sooooooooooooo çok kilo almış gibi hissediyorum... kendi kendine konuşma çok olumsuz ve kendi cildimde çok rahatsız hissediyorum... Sadece aynada kollarıma bakıyordum 2 gün önce nasıl / ne zaman tüm bu ağırlığı giydim???
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki her gün daha da kötüye gidiyorum."
Görünüşümde bir değişiklik olduğunu fark ettim ve bu beni gerçekten üzüyor.
"Aynaya baktığımda tanıyamadığım birini görüyorum, bu hissi tarif edemiyorum."
"Bu kilo alımı yüzünden kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, bu beni çok rahatsız ediyor."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, bu değişimleri kabullenmekte güçlük çekiyorum."
kilo alımı son veya ne zaman düştüğünü fark ediyorsunuz
Kilo verdiğinizde veya aldığınızda ne zaman fark ediyorsunuz?
Kilo değişikliğini ne zaman fark edersiniz?

Ne zaman kilo aldığınızı veya kaybettiğinizi nasıl anlayabilirsiniz?
Çok fazla suçluluk ve utanç taşıyorum ve daha önce daha iyi yardım alsaydım bu sonun önlenebileceğini hissettim. Her gün uyanıyorum ve ağlıyorum.
"Geçmişte yaptıklarımın ağırlığı beni eziyor, daha önce yardım alsaydım bu acıyı yaşamayacağımı düşünüyorum."
"Kendimi suçlu ve utanç içinde hissediyorum, keşke daha önce yardım alıp bu noktaya gelmeseydim."
"Her sabah uyanışım, daha önce yardım almamış olmanın pişmanlığıyla dolu."
"Geçmişte yaptıklarımın bedelini her gün ödüyorum, keşke daha önce birilerine açılsaydım."
"Bu yükün altında eziliyorum, keşke daha önce bir uzmana başvursaydım."
"Her türlü çizgiyi fark edene kadar en uzun süre bipolar olduğumu düşünürdüm. Her neyse, biraz manik bile olsa pms yaptıktan sonra başka biri çok daha iyi hissediyor mu? Beni ilaçlamam gerektiğini veya düşüklerin sooooooo düşük olduğu için bir şey düşünmemi sağlıyor."
"Her şey çok hızlı değişiyor, bazen kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum."
"Duygusal iniş çıkışlarım oldukça fazla, bazen kontrolü kaybettiğimi düşünüyorum."
"Geçenlerde, manik hissetmek bile daha iyi hissettirdi, en azından o zamanlar biraz enerjim vardı."
"İlaç almam gerektiğini düşünüyorum, çünkü bu iniş çıkışları hayatımı çok zorlaştırıyor."
"Sanki her şeyde bir düzensizlik var, sanki duygusal bir fırtınada kaybolmuşum gibi."
"yoğun duygular ama inişli çıkışlı ve depresyonsuzlardı... Boşalmış, düşük, yorgun, konsantre olamayan, endişeli ve biraz paranoyak"

"Depresyona girmeden yoğun duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşıyordum. Boşluk, düşük enerji, yorgunluk, konsantre olamama, endişe ve hafif bir paranoya hissediyordum."
"Kendimi yoğun duygularla boğuşurken buldum, iniş çıkışlıydı ama depresyona girmemiştim. Boşluk, düşük enerji, yorgunluk, konsantre olamama, endişe ve hafif bir paranoya hissi yaşıyordum."
"Vitex, akşam primrose yağı, mirena, wellbutrin ve muhtemelen diğer şeyler gibi takviyeleri denedim.... Ters yönde ince bir itme hissettim. Yüksek ruhlarda veya harika hissediyorum gibi değildi, ama aynı zamanda süper boktan veya kolayca rahatsız veya depresif hissetmiyordum."
"Çeşitli ilaçları, besin takviyelerini ve hatta bitkisel ürünleri denedim ama hiçbirisi beni tam olarak iyi hissettirmedi."
"Bazı ilaçların hafif bir etki yarattığını hissettim, ama bir şifa veya rahatlama hissi değildi."
"Birkaç farklı şey denedim, ama hepsi bana boş bir umut hissi verdi, sanki bir çözüm olmadığı gibi."
Belirtilerime yönelik birçok tedavi denedim ama hiçbirisi beklentilerimi karşılamadı.
"Bunları denemek çok yorucu, ama aynı zamanda bir umut ışığı da arıyorum, belki de doğru tedaviyi bulduğumda hissedeceğim."
Hayatta sürekli kendimi berbat hissediyorum.
Her gün kötü bir gün gibi geliyor.
Kendimi sürekli başarısız hissediyorum.
Hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor gibi hissediyorum.
Hayatımı bir türlü düzeltemiyorum.
Hepsi boşa gidiyor gibi hissediyorum.
kas ağrısı ve migren ile yorgun
"Vücudum sanki taştan yapılmış gibi, her yerim ağrıyor, başım da çatlıyor."
"Yorgunluktan bitap düştüm, kaslarımda dayanılmaz bir ağrı var, başım da dönüyor."
"Ağrılar ve yorgunluk beni perişan etti, ne yapacağımı bilemiyorum."
Kaslarımın ağrısı ve başımın çatlaması beni yataktan kalkamayacak kadar yordu.
"Yorgunluğun ve ağrının pençesindeyim, sanki bir virüs beni ele geçirmiş gibi."
"ay boyunca yaşadığım semptomlar yönetilebilir, aniden şiddetlenir ve yönetilmesi son derece zorlaşır, bu yüzden tamamen farklı bir şey gibi hissederim."
"Ay boyunca hissettiğim rahatsızlıklar genellikle hafifledi, fakat aniden yoğunlaşarak beni tamamen farklı bir kişi gibi hissettirdi."
"Yaşadığım semptomlar, bir süre hafiflese de, ani ataklarla beni kontrol edilemez hale getiriyor, sanki bambaşka biri gibiyim."
"Belirtilerim sürekli değişen bir doğaya sahip, bir süre zararsız gibi görünürken, aniden kontrol edilemez bir hal alarak beni tamamen farklı bir kişiye dönüştürüyor."

"Semptomlarımın iniş çıkışlı seyri, bir süre yönetilebilirken aniden şiddetlenerek, her zamankinden farklı bir benliğe dönüşmemi sağlıyor."
PMDD ile 3 yıldır uğraşıyorum ve nihayet bu yılın başlarında teşhis edildim. Çok uzun süredir detledim ve çok yorgunum. Ben de onlara yükmüşüm gibi hissediyorum. Her şey çok fazla geliyor. Adetim başlamadan bir hafta önce çok fazla depresyona girdim ve dönemim sona erdiğinde gitmez. Bu kadar iyi bitirmenin tek yolu gibi hissediyorum.
PMDD ile mücadele etmek çok yıpratıcı ve bunaltıcıydı.
"Artık kendimi daha iyi anlıyor olsam da, yaşadığım bu süreçte büyük bir yıpranma yaşadım."
Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşamak gerçekten zorlayıcı ve tüketici oluyor.
"Bir hafta süren depresyon ve umutsuzluk, her şeyin üstüme çöküyor gibi hissettiriyor."
Çaresizliğe kapıldığımda kendimi gerçekten yalnız ve yorgun hissediyorum.
"""Normal"" bir şey yemek için mücadele ettim ve akşam yemeği için şeker yiyebilirdim....şeker / gıda bağımlısı oldum. Şeker olmadan, endişem bile gitti"
"Partneri tarafından istismar edilen bir adam... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir adam karısına fiziksel olarak saldırdı, ona pençelendi ve ona eşyalar attı."
"Partneri tarafından istismar edilen bir adam... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir kadın kocasına fiziksel olarak saldırdı, ona pençelendi ve ona eşyalar attı."
"Eşinden şiddet gören bir kadın... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir adam eşine fiziksel olarak saldırdı, ona tekme attı ve ona eşyalar fırlattı."
"Eşinden sürekli şiddet gören bir kadın... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir kadın kocasına fiziksel olarak saldırdı, onu yumrukladı ve ona eşyalar fırlattı."
"Partnerinden yıllardır şiddet gören bir kadın... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir adam kocasına fiziksel olarak saldırdı, ona yumruk attı ve ona eşyalar fırlattı."
"Korktuğu için sessiz kalan bir kadın... zihinsel hastalığı olan bir adam karısına fiziksel olarak saldırdı, ona tokat attı ve ona eşyalar fırlattı."
Çok mutsuzdum ve atlamaya hazırdım... Gerçekten PMDD'yi deneyimliyor muyum yoksa sadece koşullarım ve çevrem mi bu hisleri tetikledi?
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyordu, her şey beni mutsuz ediyordu ve tek istediğim her şeyden uzaklaşmaktı... Acaba gerçekten PMDD mi yaşıyordum yoksa sadece bunca şeyin üst üste gelmesi mi beni böyle hissettirıyordu?"
"Çok zor zamanlar geçiriyordum, kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum ve artık her şeyden vazgeçmek istiyordum... Acaba bu PMDD miydi yoksa sadece yaşadığım olumsuzluklar mı beni bu kadar çaresiz hissettirıyordu?"
"Her şey beni çok üzüyor, kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum... Bu durum sadece geçici mi yoksa gerçekten PMDD'den mi muzdaribim?"
"Bütün bunları yaşadığım için kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor... Acaba bu PMDD mi yoksa sadece kötü bir dönemden mi geçiyorum?"
"Her şey beni çok yoruyor ve mutsuz ediyor, artık hiçbir şey yapmaya gücüm kalmadı... Bu duygular gerçekten PMDD'nin bir belirtisi mi yoksa sadece yaşadığım durumların bir sonucu mu?"
Bunun çok daha fazla öfke dolu olduğunu hissediyorum.
Bu öfke beni gerçekten etkiliyor.
Bu durumdan çok daha fazla kızgınlık duyuyorum.
"Bu, daha önce hissettiğimden çok daha fazla öfke uyandırıyor."
Bu beni içten içe çok öfkelendiriyor.
"Bu durum, benim içindeki öfkeyi gerçekten artırıyor."
Birkaç ay önce delirdim...kızgın inkar ve ruh hali değişimleri. Tepelerden ve vadilerden değil dağlardan ve siperlerden bahsediyorum.
"Yaşadığım şeyin adı ruhsal çöküş, ama herkes ruhsal çöküşün ne olduğunu bilmiyor. Bildikleri sadece 'kötü' oldukları."
Çevremdekiler beni anlamıyor gibiydi. Sanki bir uzaylıymışım gibi bakıyorlardı.
Kendimi hiç olmadığım kadar yalnız ve kaybolmuş hissediyordum. Sanki hayatın anlamını kaybetmiş gibiydim.
"En kötü anlarda bile, hayatta kalmaya çalıştığımı hatırlatıyordu bana. İşte bu yüzden, mücadele etmeye devam ediyorum."
"Gerçekten kendimle savaştım, karanlık düşüncelerle doluydu aklım. Ve bilmiyordum, bir gün geçip gidecek mi diye."
Acı verici bir dönem ağrım var ve aynı zamanda döngümün ikinci yarısında yorgunluk ve depresyon... PMDD nedeniyle ortaya çıkan öfke muhtemelen bastırılmış öfkenin bir sonucudur... Vücudum travmatik çocukluğumdan dolayı sürekli bir uçuş veya dövüş modundaydı.
"Fiziksel ve duygusal ağrılarım sürekli bir döngü halinde beni tüketiyor, özellikle de döngümün ikinci yarısında."
PMDD'nin getirdiği öfke beni tüketiyor ve bunun sebebinin bastırılmış öfke olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Çocukluğumdan gelen travmalar, sürekli bir uçuş veya dövüş modunda olmama sebep oldu ve bu da beni yorgun ve depresyonda bırakıyor."
"Yorgunluk, depresyon ve öfke... bu döngüden kurtulmak istiyorum."
"Bu beden, bu ruh, yaşadığı travmaları iyileştirmek için çabalamaya devam ediyor."
Bana TSSB'yi veren travma için yardım aramaya başladığımda PMDD tipi semptomlar almaya başladım.
Travma için tedavi almaya başladığımda Postmenstrüel Disforik Bozukluk (PMDD) benzeri semptomlar yaşamaya başladım.
Travma ile ilgili terapiye başlamamın ardından PMDD ile uyumlu belirtiler göstermeye başladım.
TSSB tedavisi görmeye başladıktan sonra ruh halimde ve davranışlarımda PMDD'ye benzer değişiklikler gözlemlemeye başladım.
"Travma sonrası stres bozukluğuna (TSSB) karşı tedavi görmeye başladığımda, PMDD ile örtüşen duygusal ve fiziksel semptomlar deneyimledim."
"Travma ile mücadele etmeye başladığımdan beri, ruh halimde ve davranışlarımda PMDD'ye benzer dalgalanmalar yaşıyorum."
"Şiddetli bir duygusal travma sürecinden geçtim ve normal pm'lerden ağır, dayanılmaz, zayıflatıcı, korkunç, korkunç, PMDD'ye geçtim."
"Geçtiğim duygusal travma sonrasında normal PMS'den çok daha ağır ve dayanılmaz bir hale geldi, artık PMDD yaşıyorum."
"O kadar kötü bir travma yaşadım ki, normal PMS'den daha kötü, dayanılmaz, zayıflatıcı, korkunç, korkunç bir PMDD'ye dönüştü."
"Şiddetli bir travmanın ardından normal PMS'den çok daha ağır ve yönetilemez bir hal aldığını fark ettim, artık PMDD yaşıyorum."
"Yaşadığım duygusal travma nedeniyle normal PMS'den çok daha kötü, korkunç, dayanılmaz, zayıflatıcı bir hal aldı, artık PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum."
"Duygusal travmanın ardından PMS'den daha ağır, dayanılmaz, zayıflatıcı, korkunç, korkunç bir hal aldı ve PMDD tanısı kondu."
Gittiğim naturopatların PMDD hakkında kesinlikle hiçbir fikri yoktu.. biri beni progesteron kremine koydu... daha sonra progesteron intoleransı olduğumu anladı..
"PMDD ile ilgili sorunlarımı anlamakta zorlanan bir sürü doktora gittim, sanki bu konuda çok fazla bilgi yokmuş gibi."
"PMDD için farklı doktorlar denedim ama çoğu, neyle karşı karşıya olduğumu gerçekten anlamadı."
"Birkaç doktora gittim ama hiçbiri PMDD'yi gerçekten anlayamadı, hatta biri bana yanlış tedavi bile uyguladı."
PMDD'yi anlamak konusunda uzman olduğunu söyleyen doktorlara gittim ama çoğu zaman yardım edemediler.
PMDD hakkında bilgi sahibi olduklarını iddia eden birkaç naturopata gittim ama sonunda kendi başıma çözüm bulmak zorunda kaldım.
"İki travmatik olayı geride bırakmadan önce PMS'im bile olmadı, daha sonra tam olarak patlayan PMD'den şüphelendiğim bir şeye girdim."
"Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak zorlayıcı iki olay yaşadıktan sonra, önceden hiç PMS'im yokken, şimdi şiddetli PMD belirtileriyle mücadele ediyorum."
"Yaşadığım iki büyük zorluktan sonra, ilk kez PMD'nin benim için ne kadar yıkıcı olabileceğini fark ettim."
"Hayatımda her şey yolundayken, PMS'im bile yoktu. Son iki büyük olaydan sonra, bu şiddetli PMD'nin benim için yeni bir gerçeklik olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"İki travmatik olayı atlattıktan sonra, normal PMS'im bile yokken, şimdi PMD'nin benim üzerindeki etkisini hissediyorum."
"Bu iki olaydan sonra vücudumda bir değişiklik hissettim, PMS'im bile yoktu, şimdi tamamen PMD'ye girmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Travmanın işlenmesi ve iyileştirilmesi, biraz daha iyi olmamıza yardımcı olacaktır."
"Travma ile yüzleşmek ve onu işlemek, hayatımızda daha fazla ilerleme kaydetmemizi sağlayacaktır."
Geçmişteki travmatik deneyimleri işleyerek ve onlardan dersler çıkararak daha güçlü ve dirençli hale gelebiliriz.
"Travmanın yaralarını iyileştirmek, kendimizi daha iyi anlamamıza ve daha sağlıklı bir yaşam sürmemize yardımcı olacaktır."
"Travmayı işlemek ve onunla yüzleşmek,  gelecekte benzer durumlarla daha sağlıklı bir şekilde başa çıkmamızı sağlayacaktır."
"Travmayı iyileştirme süreci uzun ve zorlu olabilir, ancak sonunda daha iyi bir yere ulaşmamıza yardımcı olacaktır."
CPTSD'm var ve ne zaman bir soğuk algınlığı veya griple hastalansam (hatta düşme veya ayak parmağımı çarpma gibi küçük bir şey) çok güçlü bir duygusal tepkim var.
"Çocukluğumda yaşadığım travmalar nedeniyle, küçük bir rahatsızlık bile beni çok kötü bir şekilde etkiliyor."
"Herhangi bir hastalık, hatta küçük bir yaralanma bile, CPTSD'min tetiklenmesine neden oluyor."
Sanki bedenim her zaman geçmişte yaşadığım travmalara hazırlanmış gibi hissediyorum.
"Fiziksel bir rahatsızlığım olduğunda, duygusal olarak çöküyorum."
"Küçük bir şey bile büyük bir duygusal fırtınaya dönüşebiliyor, çünkü CPTSD'm her zaman beni takip ediyor."
"DEHB'ye sahibim ve 22 yaşına kadar tüm hayatım boyunca teşhis edilmedim. Bu, anksiyete bozuklukları, uykusuzluk, okul ve üniversitede mücadeleler ve gerçekten düşük bir özgüvene yol açtı, çünkü diğer herkese ayak uyduramadım."
"DEHB teşhisim geç geldiği için, kendimi sürekli başkalarına uyum sağlamaya çalışırken buldum ve bu da anksiyete, uykusuzluk ve düşük özgüven gibi sorunlara yol açtı."
"22 yaşına kadar DEHB teşhisi konulmayan bir birey olarak, okul ve üniversitede zorluklar yaşadım ve diğer insanların temposuna uymakta zorlandığım için kendimi yetersiz hissettim."
"Yaşadığım zorlukların kaynağını anlamamıştım ve bu yüzden anksiyete, uykusuzluk ve düşük özgüven gibi bir dizi problemle mücadele ettim. "
"Etrafımdaki insanlar hayatlarının her alanında başarılıyken ben sürekli mücadele ediyordum, bu da DEHB'nin teşhis edilmemesiyle ilgili olduğunu ancak daha sonra öğrendim."
"Yaşadığım anksiyete, uykusuzluk ve düşük özgüvenin altında yatan sebebin DEHB olduğunu ancak 22 yaşına kadar anlamadım ve bu da beni hayatım boyunca zorladı."
"Ayrıca, PMDD'den ve benim de sahip olduğum TSSB'ye bağlı olması merakından da muzdaripim, ancak yıllarca süren fiziksel ve zihinsel olarak mücadele veya uçuş modundan sonra, bastırılmış travmanın işlenmesinin vücudun biyokimyasını veya hormonal dalgalanmalara duyarlılığını değiştireceğinden ciddi şüphelerim var."
"PMDD'den ve TSSB'den muzdarip olmakla birlikte, yıllardır süren mücadele ve uçuş modunun vücudumun nasıl tepki verdiğini etkilediğinden eminim."
"Travmanın işlenmesinin vücudun hormonal dalgalanmalara verdiği tepkiyi değiştirdiğini hissediyorum, belki de bu yüzden PMDD ve TSSB ile mücadele ediyorum."
"Uzun yıllar süren mücadele ve uçuş modunun, PMDD ve TSSB belirtilerim üzerinde bir etkisi olabileceğini düşünüyorum."
"Vücudumun PMDD'ye ve TSSB'ye verdiği tepki, yıllarca süren mücadele ve uçuş modunun sonucu olabilir."
"Bütün bu yıllar boyunca yaşadığım fiziksel ve zihinsel mücadele, vücudumun hormonal değişikliklere verdiği tepkiyi değiştirmiş olabilir ve bu da PMDD ve TSSB'yi daha da zorlaştırabilir."
"Benim için aynı duygusal stresin her iki döngüde de ortaya çıkacağını fark ederdim. Benim için bu derin bir terk etme / çok yalnız olma hissiydi, benlik değeri ve umutsuzluk yoktu."
"Bu duygu bana tanıdık geliyordu, iki döngüde de aynı hissi yaşıyordum. Tekrar tekrar o derin terk edilmişlik duygusunu yaşıyordum."
"Her seferinde aynı hisle karşılaşıyordum. Bu derin yalnızlık duygusu, umutsuzluk, değersizlik, hiçbiri yeni değildi."
"Aynı sıkıntıyı iki döngüde de yaşıyordum. Kendimi terk edilmiş ve yalnız hissettim, değersiz ve umutsuz, yine aynı hisler."
"Kendimi bu duygusal stresin pençesinde buldum, iki döngüde de aynı hisler. Yalnızlık, değersizlik, umutsuzluk..."
"Bu döngüleri yaşadıkça aynı duygusal stresi hissettim. Bu derin yalnızlık, değersizlik ve umutsuzluk, beni her seferinde esir aldı."
CPTSD'm için terapiye gitmeye başladığımdan beri geri dönüşlerimin çoğunu dönemimden iki hafta önce alıyorum... berbat çünkü beni daha da endişeli ve stresli hissettiriyorlar.
"Terapiye başlamadan önceki dönemde geri dönüşlerimin çoğunu yaşamaya başladım, bu da beni aşırı endişeli ve stresli hissettirdiği için gerçekten kötü hissettiriyor."
"CPTSD için tedavi almaya başladığımdan beri, geri dönüşlerim çoğunlukla dönemimden iki hafta önce yaşanıyor. Bu durum beni endişeli ve stresli hissettiriyor, bu da çok kötü bir deneyim."
"Terapiye gitmeye başladıktan sonra, geçmişimin etkilerinin dönemimden iki hafta önce geri dönüşler şeklinde yaşanmaya başladığını fark ettim. Bu durum beni endişeli ve stresli yapıyor, bu da beni gerçekten üzüyor."
"Dönemimden iki hafta önce gelen geri dönüşler, terapiye başladıktan sonra daha da belirginleşti. Bu durum beni aşırı derecede endişeli ve stresli hissettiriyor, bu da yaşamayı zorlaştırıyor."
"Terapi sayesinde geçmişimin yaralarını iyileştirmeye çalışırken, dönemimden iki hafta önce gelen geri dönüşler beni çok endişeli ve stresli hale getiriyor. Bu durumun beni olumsuz etkilediğini hissediyorum."
Şükran 2019 Kardeşlerim ve ben (o sırada 28 yıldır evli olan) ebeveynlerimize gittik ve Şükran Günü'nden bir gün önce babam eve gelmedi. Annemi terk etti.... Her iki ebeveynime de duygusal olarak yardımcı olmanın yükünü üstlendim.... Sonra pandemi... Bir gecede nasıl çalıştığımı büyük ölçüde değiştirmek zorunda kaldım... Gerçekten almaktan korkuyordum ya da bir başkasına vermekten.... Şimdi nişanlımla tanıştım ve Mart 2020'de çıkmaya başladık.
"2019'da Şükran Günü'nde her şey normal gibiydi, ama sonra babamın beklenmedik bir şekilde ailemizi terk etmesiyle hayatımız altüst oldu."

Adetlerim her zaman acı verici ve duygusal deneyimler oldu... Luteal dönemim boyunca yoğun panik ataklar olduğu ortaya çıkan 3 kez hastaneye götürüldüm.

"Otizm tanısı aldığımdan beri, özellikle de teşhis edilmemiş kadınların yaşadığı zorlukları görünce otistik kadınların marjinalleşmesi beni çok üzüyor."
"Otizmin getirdiği zorlukları kendim deneyimledikten sonra, teşhis edilmemiş otistik kadınların mücadelelerini görmek beni gerçekten derinden etkiliyor."
"Otizmle yaşamak zaten zor, ama PMDD'nin de üstüne eklenmesi çok acı verici; otistik kadınların yaşadığı bu ek zorluklar beni çok üzüyor."
"Otizmi kendimde deneyimledikten sonra, otistik kadınların karşılaştığı engelleri ve özellikle de teşhis edilmemiş olanların mücadelesini daha iyi anlayabiliyorum."
"Otizm tanısı aldığımdan beri, özellikle de teşhis edilmemiş kadınların mücadeleleri göz önüne alındığında, otistik kadınların marjinalleşmesi konusunda daha çok endişeleniyorum."
Erimelerimin sıklığını ve hatta daha fazla belirginleşen aşırı duyarlılığın PMDD'm olduğunu fark etmemi sağlayan şey olduğunu hissediyorum.
Hormonal değişikliklerin duygusal dalgalanmalarımı nasıl etkilediğini anlamaya başladığımda PMDD teşhisi konuldu.
Kendimi her ay aynı duygusal iniş çıkışlar içinde buluyorum ve bunun nedeni PMDD olduğuna inanıyorum.
Aşırı duygusal tepkilerim ve ruh halimdeki ani değişimler PMDD'den kaynaklanıyor gibi görünüyor.
Duygusal olarak hassasiyetim arttıkça PMDD'nin hayatımı nasıl etkilediğini daha iyi anlıyorum.
Kendimi çok hassas ve duygusal hissetmeye başladığımdan beri PMDD'nin gerçekte ne kadar şiddetli olabileceğini fark ediyorum.
"Adetim başlamadan hemen önce en düşük 2-3 günümdeyim...Hala bazı şeyler hakkında gergindim...PMDD çöpleri bile asla kaybolmaz, daha yönetilebilir olabileceği umudum var."
"Adet dönemimden önceki 2-3 gün oldukça zorlu geçiyor, gerginlik ve endişe artıyor."
Adet öncesi sendromumun etkileri başlamadan önce bile kendimi oldukça düşük ve gergin hissediyorum.
"PMDD'nin etkileri hala hayatımı etkiliyor, ancak bazı günler diğerlerinden daha iyi."
"Her ay aynı mücadeleyi yaşıyorum, adet dönemimden önceki günler çok zorlu."
"Umarım bir gün PMDD semptomları tamamen kaybolur, en azından daha iyi yönetmeyi öğrenebileceğimi umuyorum."
Sonunda açıklığa kavuştum ve çocukluğumdan beri beni rahatsız eden her gizemi anlıyorum... Şiddetli depresyon ve genel anksiyete bozukluğu ile yanlış teşhis edildim... Şimdi enerjimi nasıl kullanacağımı nasıl modüle edeceğimi anlamaya başladım ve 'hayır' dediğim için kendimi suçlu hissetmiyorum.
Uzun zamandır kendimi anlamaya çalışıyordum ve sonunda kendimi bulduğumu düşünüyorum. Geçmişte yaşadığım sıkıntılar ve kaygılar artık beni korkutmuyor çünkü artık nasıl başa çıkacağımı biliyorum.
Artık kendime ve ihtiyaçlarıma daha fazla dikkat ediyorum. Geçmişte kendimi görmezden geldiğim için kendimi suçlu hissetmekten bıktım. Şimdi kendime olan sevgimi ve saygımı yeniden keşfediyorum.
Geçmişte yaşadığım sıkıntıların bana neden olduğunu anladığım için kendimi artık çok daha güçlü hissediyorum.  Artık kendimi dinliyor ve ihtiyaçlarım için mücadele ediyorum.
Yıllardır kendimi arayan bir yolculuktaydım ve sonunda kendime ulaştım. Kendimi tanıdığım ve güçlü yönlerimi kabul ettiğim için çok mutluyum.
Kendime karşı dürüst olmak ve kendimi sevmek için artık özgürüm. Geçmişe takılıp kalmak yerine geleceğe odaklanarak yeni bir hayata başlıyorum.
On yılı aşkın bir süredir PMDD teşhisi aldım ve son zamanlarda terapistimle ASD hakkında konuşmaya başladım.
Uzun yıllar PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum ve son dönemde terapistimle Asperger sendromu hakkında konuşmaya başladım.
On yıldan fazla bir süredir PMDD ile yaşıyorum ve yakın zamanda terapistimle ASD'nin benim için bir olasılık olup olmadığını görüştük.
PMDD teşhisimden beri uzun bir süre geçti ve son zamanlarda terapistimle ASD hakkında konuşmaya başladım.
Yıllardır PMDD tanısı ile yaşıyorum ve son dönemde terapistimle ASD'nin olası bir etken olup olmadığını konuşmaya başladık.
Uzun yıllardır PMDD ile uğraşıyorum ve son zamanlarda terapistimle ASD'nin benim için bir ihtimal olup olmadığını tartışmaya başladık.
Sanırım benim için yaptıkları tek şey işleri daha da kötüleştirmek ve gerçek belirtilerimi maskelemek.
"Bu ilaçlar beni daha kötü hissettirdi, sanki gerçek sorunlarımı saklıyorlar gibi."
"Her şey daha da karışıyor, sanki bilerek beni daha fazla kafa karışıklığına sürüklüyorlar."
"Yardım ettiklerini düşündükleri her şey, aslında her şeyi daha da kötüleştiriyor."
"Gerçekten iyi niyetli olabilirler ama yaptıkları her şey, sorunu daha da büyütüyor."
"Eğer gerçekten yardımcı olmak istiyorlarsa, beni değil, sorunları ele almaları gerekir."
Vücudum benden nefret ediyor ve bununla ya da tamamen farklı bir şeyle ilgili olup olmadığından asla emin değilim.
Fiziksel olarak çok kötü hissediyorum ve bunun nedeni olduğundan emin değilim.
Bedenim benimle işbirliği yapmayı reddediyor ve sebebini bilmiyorum.
Sanki vücudum beni cezalandırıyor ve nedenini anlamıyorum.
"Bir şeylerin ters gittiği çok açık, ancak bu vücudumla mı yoksa başka bir şeyle mi ilgili bilmiyorum."
"Bu sürekli yorgunluk ve halsizlik beni yoruyor, bunun sebebi ne olabilir ki?"
Düşük aktif vagus siniri ile ASD arasında olası bir bağlantı...
Düşük aktif vagus siniri ile otizm spektrum bozukluğu arasında da olası bir bağlantı olabilir mi?
"Araştırmalar, düşük aktif vagus sinirinin depresyon riskini artırdığını gösteriyor."
"Vagus siniri aktivitesini artırmak, kalp sağlığını olumlu yönde etkileyebilir."
Düşük aktif vagus sinirinin bağışıklık sistemi üzerinde de olumsuz etkileri olabilir.
"Vagus siniri aktivitesini artıran egzersizler, genel sağlık ve refahı iyileştirebilir."
"Sonunda kendimi kabul etmek, kendime karşı çalışmak yerine, yeni bir bölgedir, ancak yeni bir bölgeyi memnuniyetle karşılamaktadır. Evet, bazı şeyleri daha zor hale getiren spektrumda olmanın yan etkileri var, ancak zihinlerimizin nasıl çalıştığını seviyorum. Otistik insanlar genellikle niyetlerle daha otantik ve saftır, öyle görünüyor."
"Kendimi kabullenmek, kendime karşı savaşmak yerine, yeni bir başlangıç, yeni bir bölge. Evet, zorluklar var, ancak bu zihniyetin güzelliği beni etkiliyor."
"Otizmin getirdiği farklılıklar bazen zorlayıcı olsa da, bu farklılıkların yaratıcılık ve otantik düşünmeyi nasıl beslediğini görmek inanılmaz."
"Zihnimin nasıl çalıştığını ve dünyayı nasıl algıladığımı anlamak, bana benzersiz bir perspektif sunuyor. Bu, her şeyden önce bir hediye."
"Evet, bazı şeyleri zorlaştırıyor, ama bunun benim kimliğimin bir parçası olduğunu kabul etmek, bir özgürlük."
"Otizmin getirdiği farklılıklardan kaynaklanan zorlukların üstesinden gelmek, beni güçlü, özgün ve yaratıcı bir birey yapıyor."
"PMDD'li kadınlar, otizm ne oranda meydana gelir?"
PMDD ile otizmin birbiriyle ilişkisi nasıl?
PMDD'li kadınlarda otizm görüyor musunuz?
PMDD'li kadınlarda otizm oranı hakkında ne düşünüyorsunuz?
PMDD'li kadınlar otizm açısından risk altında mı?
PMDD'li kadınlar arasında otizmin görülme sıklığı ne kadardır?
"Hepsinin eşiğinin üzerinden ve büyük bir kısmı için iyi bir skor yaptım. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
"Hepsinin test sonuçları geldi ve çoğunda iyi bir skor aldım. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
"İlk teşhis sonuçları çıktı, çoğunda iyi bir puan aldım. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
"Sonuçları aldım ve çoğunda iyi performans gösterdim. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
"Tüm testleri tamamladım ve çoğunda iyi sonuçlar aldım. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
"Sonuçlarım iyi geldi, en azından büyük bir kısmında. PMDD, DEHB, anksiyete, depresyon ve muhtemelen otizm."
29'da teşhis edildim... gerçekten birçok yönden benzer! Bu yüzden bir arıza geçirdim sonra teşhis edildi ve şimdi farklı bir insan olarak yavaş yavaş kendim olmaya ve garip olarak adlandırılmamaya veya büyümeye izin verildiği için neredeyse uyanıyorum!
29 yaşında teşhis edildim... hayatımda çok şey değişti!
"Ben de bir kırılma yaşadım, sonra teşhis oldum ve şimdi kendimi yeniden keşfediyorum."
Değişimden önce ve sonra olmak çok farklı... Sanki yeniden doğmuş gibiyim.
Kendimi bulma yolculuğumda hala çok yol kat etmem gerektiğini fark ediyorum.
Teşhis edilmeden önce olduğum kişiyle artık çok farklıyım. Artık kendimi daha iyi anlıyorum.
"48 yaşıma kadar teşhis konulmadı. Şimdi 49 yaşındayım. Adhd de, CPTSD de tüm bunlar yüzünden."
"48 yaşına kadar doktorlar doğru teşhisi koyamadılar, ancak şimdi 49 yaşındayım ve durumlarımın ADHD ve CPTSD olduğunu öğrendim."
"Hayatım boyunca bir şeyler yolunda olmadığını hissettim, ama 48 yaşına kadar nedenini bilemedim. Meğerse ADHD ve CPTSD varmış."
"Uzun süredir mücadele ettiğim şeylerin bir açıklaması olduğunu bilmek harika, ancak keşke daha önce teşhis konulmuş olsaydı."
"48 yaşına kadar yaşadığım zorlukların bir açıklaması olduğunu öğrenince şok oldum. İşte buradayım, 49 yaşındayım ve hayatımı yeniden inşa etmeye çalışıyorum."
"Tüm bu yıllar boyunca kendimi suçladım, ancak şimdi durumlarımı anlıyorum ve daha iyi bir yolculuk için hazırım."
Terapistim yıllar boyunca yanlış ppl'ye nasıl aşık olduğumu çözemedi çünkü aptal bir insan değilim. Ben de çözemedim. ASD benim için genel olarak yaşamla ilgili birçok noktayı birbirine bağlıyordu.
"Terapist yıllarca benim neden yanlış insanlara aşık olduğumu anlamadı, çünkü ben aptal değilim. Ben de anlamadım."
"Bana neden hep yanlış insanlara aşık olduğumu soruyorlar, ama ben aptal değilim. Nedenini ben de bilmiyorum."
"Psikolog yıllarca bu aşk bağımlılığımı çözemedi, ben aptal olduğumu düşünmüyorum. Bu yüzden hala aşık oluyorum."
"Neden hep yanlış insanlara aşık oluyorum, bunu ben de anlamıyorum. Terapist bile bunu çözemedi, çünkü ben aptal değilim."
"Yıllarca yanlış insanlara aşık olmanın nedenini anlamaya çalıştım, terapiste bile gittim ama ben aptal değilim. Bu yüzden hala aşık oluyorum."
"Ben kendi kendine teşhis atm & resmi bir değerlendirme bekliyor, ve annem bunu bilen birkaç ppl biridir. Sadece geçen hafta o benimle alay ve ben 2 yaşında olup olmadığımı soruyordu (Ben 40 yaşındayım) o inanılmaz basit olarak kabul bir şey ile yardım istedi çünkü."
"Ailemde bir şeyler olduğunda, en büyük destekçim annem oluyor. Ama geçen hafta kendimi gerçekten çaresiz hissettiğimde, beni bir çocuk gibi görüp alay etti, çok sinirlendim."
"Annem bazen beni çok iyi tanıyor, sorunlarımın kaynağını anlayabiliyor. Ancak geçen hafta, yardım istediğimde beni küçümsemesi beni çok üzdü."
"Annemle aramızda özel bir bağ var, ama bazen benimle nasıl konuştuğu gerçekten canımı yakıyor. Özellikle geçen hafta, bana yardım etmesi gereken yerde, beni çocuk gibi görüp alay etmesiyle."
"Yardım istediğimde, annemden empati beklemek yerine, beni küçümseyen bir yaklaşımla karşı karşıya kaldım. Bu durum beni gerçekten hayal kırıklığına uğrattı."
"Ailemin beni desteklemesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum, özellikle zor zamanlarımda. Ama annem geçen hafta, alay ederek durumu daha da kötüleştirdi. Kendimi çok yalnız ve çaresiz hissettim."
O sırada zihinsel olarak başa çıkamıyordum.
O an için duygusal olarak kendimi toparlayamadım.
"O anda ne olduğunu anlayamadım, zihnim karışmıştı."
"Zihnim o sırada o kadar doluydu ki, durumu kavrayamıyordum."
"O anki olaylar karşısında şok içindeydim, zihnim donmuştu."
"O kadar yoğun bir duygu karmaşası içindeydim ki, hiçbir şeyin farkında değildim."
Her zaman alaycılığı yakalamakta yavaş davrandım. ulterior motifler için sahte olmak bizim için yabancı bir kavramdır.
"Alaycılığı anlayamadığımda kendimi aptal hissettim, çünkü gerçek duygularının ardında gizli bir niyet arayan biri olmadığım için kendimi biraz saflıkta kaybettiğimi düşündüm."
"Benim için insanların niyetlerini, özellikle de olumsuz niyetleri hemen kavramak çok zordur, çünkü dürüstlük ve açıklık bana hep doğal gelmiştir."
"İnsanlar alaycılığı fark etmekte zorlandığım için bana bazen saflıkla suçlarlar, oysa ben sadece gerçek niyetlerini anlayamadığımı düşünürüm."
"İnsanlar sürekli olarak gizli planlar yaptıklarını düşünerek hayatlarını yaşarlar. Ben ise, insanların çoğu zaman basitçe kendileri olduklarını varsayarım."
Alaycılığı anlamamak beni hep endişelendirdi. Herkesin bir amacı olduğunu ve sürekli olarak bir şey sakladıklarını düşünüyordum.
"Kardeşlerimle her konuştuğumda, büyüme argümanını alırdım ve hala böyle hissettiklerini biliyorum, ancak nasıl davrandığımı ve zevk aldığım şeylerden zevk alıyorum! Hala konfor öğelerim var ve küçük yeğenlerimle kendi seviyelerinde oynamaktan zevk alıyor olmam beni daha az bir insan ya da yetişkin yapmaz!"
"Kardeşlerimle konuşurken hep bana büyüme öğütleri verirlerdi ve bunu hala yaptıklarını biliyorum, ama ben kendi yolumda gidiyorum ve kendimi iyi hissettiren şeylerden zevk alıyorum!"
"Büyüme, bazıları için her zaman önemli olabilir, ama ben kendimi, kendi değerlerimi ve kendimi iyi hissettiren şeyleri buldum."
"Benim de konfor alanım var ve yeğenlerimle çocukça oyunlar oynamak bana mutluluk veriyor. Bu beni daha az yetişkin yapmıyor, sadece kendimi keşfetmemi ve keyif almamı sağlıyor."
"Kardeşlerim bana her zaman doğru yolu göstermeye çalışırlar, ama ben kendim olmak ve kendi kararlarımı almak istiyorum. Bu, daha az yetişkin olmak anlamına gelmiyor, sadece kendim olmaktır."
"Bazen kendimizi kanıtlamaya çalışırız, ama belki de kendimizi sevmeyi ve olduğumuz gibi kabul etmeyi öğrenmeliyiz."
Travma yanıtlarımı (uçuş / fawn) ve onları maskelemek için nasıl kullandığımı anlayın.
Travma sonrası tepkilerimi ve başa çıkma mekanizmalarımı tam olarak anlamak istiyorum.
Travmaya verdiğim tepkiler (kaçma/boyun eğme) ve bunları nasıl gizlediğimi çözmeye çalışıyorum.
"Kendimi korumak için travma sonrası uçuş/fawn tepkisine başvuruyorum, bunu anlamak istiyorum."
Travma deneyimimden kaynaklanan kaçma/fawn davranışımı ve bunu gizleme yöntemlerimi daha iyi anlamak istiyorum.
Uçuş/fawn mekanizmalarımı daha iyi anlayarak travma yanıtımı yönetmeyi hedefliyorum.
"Sadece dönemime kadar son derece asabi ve depresif hissediyorum ve duygularımda genel olarak dengesizim. Sadece duygusal olarak o kadar tükendim ki, işleri sürdürmem gerçekten zorlaşıyor."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi çok gergin, mutsuz ve duygusal olarak dengesiz hissediyorum. Bu kadar duygusal olarak yorgunum ki, günlük işlerimi yapmakta zorlanıyorum."
"Duygusal olarak bir iniş çıkış yaşıyorum, bir an çok heyecanlı, bir an çok depresif hissediyorum. Bu ruh halindeki değişimler işimi sürdürmeyi zorlaştırıyor."
"Kendimi çok tükenmiş hissediyorum. Depresyon ve endişe, günlük yaşamımda zorluklara neden oluyor. Sadece ayakta kalabilmek için mücadele ediyorum."
"Duygusal dengesizliklerim, günlerimi zorlaştırıyor. Asabi ve depresif olmak, işlerimi yapmamı zorlaştırıyor. Yorgun hissediyorum."
"Kendimi aşırı gergin ve depresif hissediyorum, bu da duygusal dengesizliğe yol açıyor. Bu dengesizlik, günlük işlerimi yapmakta zorlanmama neden oluyor."
"Bazı ruh hali değişiklikleri, kuru cilt, migren, son bir ağır dönem, ağrı kemikleri ve bazı uyku bozuklukları yaşadım. Ama şimdi gerçekten garip hissediyorum. Anlatması zor. Buradayım gibi, ama değilim. Biraz melankoli gibi. Depresyon veya kaygı değil, bu duygulara çok alışığım. Ama hissettiğim iyi bir duygu değil."
"Son zamanlarda kendimi biraz garip hissediyorum. Fiziksel belirtiler de yaşadım, sanki vücudum bana bir şey anlatmaya çalışıyor gibi."
"Ruh halimde iniş çıkışlar yaşıyorum, uyku düzenim bozuldu, vücudum ağrıyor ve bir hissizlik içindeyim. İyi hissetmiyorum, sanki kendimde değilim."
"Kendimi depresif veya kaygılı hissetmiyorum, ama kesinlikle iyi hissetmiyorum. Sanki varlığımın bir parçası eksik gibi, anlatamam."
"Biraz melankoli, biraz yorgunluk, biraz da boşluk hissi. Bu hissi tarif etmek zor, ama içimde bir şeylerin doğru gitmediğini hissediyorum."
"Sanki vücudum bir mesaj gönderiyor, ama ne olduğunu anlayamıyorum. İyi hissetmiyorum, ama bu kötü bir his değil. Sadece garip. Anlatması zor."
"Gerçek, sıcak basmalar, göğüste ağır hisler ve sadece genel korku hissetmemek"
"Menopoz belirtileri arasında, sıcak basmalar, göğüste ağır his ve genel korku hissi gibi semptomlar da var."
"Geçen gün, gerçek sıcak basmalar, göğsümde ağırlık ve genel bir korku hissi yaşadım."
"Sıcak basmaları, göğüs ağrısı ve genel bir korku hissi, bazı kadınların menopoz sırasında yaşadığı belirtiler."
"Genel korku hissi, sıcak basmaları ve göğüste ağırlık hissi beni endişelendirmeye başladı."
"Kendimi gerçek sıcak basmalar, göğüste ağırlık ve genel bir korku hissi içinde buldum."
Cehennem haftasındayım ve bir müşteriye çok kötü bir mimarlık taslağı gönderdim. Hayatımı bunun etrafında yaşamak zorunda kalmak çok sinir bozucu.
Bu hafta tam bir felaket! Bir müşteriye korkunç bir mimarlık taslağı gönderdim ve kendimi bundan dolayı kötü hissediyorum.
Hafta berbat geçti. Müşteriye gönderdiğim mimarlık taslağı tam bir fiyasko. Bu durumu düzeltmek için uğraşmak çok yorucu.
Her şey ters gidiyor! Bir müşteriye son derece kötü bir mimarlık taslağı gönderdim ve bu durum beni gerçekten strese sokuyor.
Bu haftaki işler çok kötü gitti. Bir müşteriye çok kötü bir mimarlık taslağı gönderdim ve bu durum beni oldukça hayal kırıklığına uğrattı.
"Bu hafta yaşadığım en kötü şey, bir müşteriye korkunç bir mimarlık taslağı göndermiş olmam. Bu olayla başa çıkmak oldukça zor."
"Depresyonumu, endişemi, ocd'umu fark etmeye başladım ve dönemim boyunca öfkem daha da yaygınlaşacaktı."
"Depresyon, endişe ve ocd belirtileri yaşadığım dönemlerde öfkemin de arttığını fark ettim."
"Tüm bunlar, depresyonun, anksiyetenin ve ocd'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini ve özellikle de öfkemin yoğunluğunu arttırdığını gösteriyordu."
"Bu dönemde ruh halimde büyük dalgalanmalar yaşadım, depresyon, endişe, ocd ve şiddetli öfke hissiyle boğuşuyordum."
"Depresyonum, anksiyetem ve ocd'm her geçen gün biraz daha yoğunlaşıyordu ve özellikle öfkemin kontrolü zorlaşmıştı."
"Depresyon, anksiyete ve ocd'nin yanı sıra, bu dönemde öfkemin kontrol edilemez bir şekilde arttığını hissettim."
"Bundan korkuyorum ve bunu canlı, kelimenin tam anlamıyla atlatmayı umuyorum, ama bana doğru gelen şeyin ne olduğunu biliyorum."
"Bu durum beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor, umarım bir şekilde atlatabilirim ama içimde bir his var, kaçınılmaz olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Bu olaydan korkuyorum ve olmasını engellemek için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım ama gerçekçi olmak gerekirse, bunun gerçekleşeceğini hissediyorum."
"Bu konuda büyük bir kaygım var ve bunun üstesinden gelmeyi umuyorum, ama içimde bir ses bu durumun kaçınılmaz olduğunu söylüyor."
"Bu durum beni oldukça korkutuyor ve bununla yüzleşmekten kaçınmak istiyorum, ama hissettiğim şey, bununla yüzleşmek zorunda kalacağımı gösteriyor."
"Bu olay beni rahatsız ediyor ve bununla başa çıkmayı umuyorum, ancak gerçekçi bir bakış açısıyla bunun kaçınılmaz olduğunu düşünüyorum."
Kadınların yıllardır onlardan muzdarip olduğu için hayal kırıklığına uğradım ve yine de doktorların verebileceği en iyi tavsiye kelimenin tam anlamıyla kadınların çoğunluğuna yardımcı değil ve hatta onlar için daha fazla soruna neden olabilir. İnsanların krampların normal olduğunu söylemekten bıktım. Neden her ay bir hafta boyunca bir şey yapamam? Kötü bir zaman dilimi nedeniyle şu anda tatilde eksik olan rant için özür dilerim ve bu konuda çok üzgün / öfkeli hissediyorum.
Adet dönemi ağrıları konusunda yeterince bilgi ve destek olmaması gerçekten beni sinirlendiriyor. Her ay bu acılara katlanmamız neden normal kabul ediliyor?
Kadınların sağlık sorunlarının yeterince ciddiye alınmadığını görmek çok üzücü. Özellikle adet dönemi ağrıları hakkında 'normal' demek çok kolaycılığa kaçmak.
Neden kadınların adet dönemi ağrılarıyla ilgili daha fazla araştırma ve tedavi seçeneği yok? Bu durumun sadece bir 'normal ağrı' olarak geçiştirilmesine anlam veremiyorum.
Doktorların adet dönemi ağrılarına yönelik sunduğu çözümler yetersiz ve çoğu zaman kadınlar için daha fazla sorun yaratıyor. Bu konuda daha çok şey yapılması gerekiyor.
Bu acıların bir ayda bir hafta boyunca yaşamımızı etkilemesini kabul etmek istemiyorum. Kadınların bu acıları normalleştirmesi konusunda endişeliyim.
"Bütün kararlarımdan şüphe etmeye başladım ışık yok, sadece karanlığı tüketen tek kişi benim tartışabileceğim en yalnız halim."
"Kararlarımın doğruluğundan emin değilim, her şey karanlıkta kaybolmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Kendimle yalnız bir savaş veriyorum, iç sesim şüphelerle dolu."
"İç sesim beni kemiriyor, doğru yolda olup olmadığımı sorgulamaktan vazgeçemiyorum."
"Benimle birlikte hareket eden bir ışık yok, yalnız karanlıkta yürüyorum."
"Hiçbir şeyden emin değilim, etrafım karışık düşüncelerle çevrili."
"Deli gibi hissediyorum. Son birkaç hafta içinde yıllar içinde olduğundan daha fazla ağladım, karanlık bir kıyamet hissi hissediyorum, düz düşünemiyorum gibi hissediyorum, ne kadar denersem deneyeyim uykum yok, sıcak basmalar, mide bulantısı ve kusma yaşıyorum, pasif olarak intihar ve müdahaleci düşünceler hissediyorum, hızlı ve filtresiz konuştuğumu fark ettim ve endişem ya çatıdan geçiyor ya da hissediyorum"
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki her şey altüst olmuş gibi."
"Bu son haftalar inanılmaz derecede zorlu geçti, kendimi tamamen çökmek üzere gibi hissediyorum."
"Endişelerim beni yiyip bitiriyor, uyuyamıyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum, artık kendimi kontrol edemiyorum."
"Hiçbir şey yolunda değil, her şey çok karmaşık, kendimi kaybolmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu hisleri nasıl durduracağımı bilmiyorum, kendimi tamamen tükenmiş gibi hissediyorum."
Bütün hafta uyumadım ve uyku eksikliği duygusal durumumu son derece kötüleştirdi. Endişe ve depresyon için biraz rahatlama bulma umuduyla lexapro'ya yeni başladım.
"Uykusuzluğun beni gerçekten yordu, moralim çok bozuldu. Lexapro'nun bana biraz olsun iyi gelmesini umuyorum."
"Uyku eksikliği beni tüketti, sinirlerim bozuldu, moralim yerlerde. Umarım Lexapro işe yarar."
"Bu hafta hiç uyumadım, duygusal olarak berbat durumdayım. İnşallah Lexapro biraz rahatlama sağlar."
Sürekli yorgunluk ve uykusuzluk beni çok yıprattı. Bu ilaç bana biraz olsun iyi gelirse ne mutlu.
"Uyku problemi yüzünden çok mutsuzum, duygusal olarak bitap düştüm. Lexapro işe yarayacak diye umuyorum."
"Çok endişeli ve fırtınalıyım. Kontrol etmeye ve saklamaya çalıştığım bir şey ama kaybedilmiş bir oyun gibi geliyor, zaten benim hakkımda karar verdiler. Adetimden birkaç gün uzaktayım ve endişem 10'da."
Sonunda hamile kaldığım gerçeğiyle yüzleşmek zorundayım ve bu gerçekle başa çıkmak için kendimi hazır hissetmiyorum.
Adet gecikmemi düşününce içimde kocaman bir boşluk hissediyorum. sanki her şey kontrolümden çıkmış gibi.
Her şey yolunda gitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorum. Bildiğim her şey çöküyor ve ben sadece çaresizce bekliyorum.
En kötü ihtimalleri düşünüyorum ve kendimi içinde bulunduğum bu ruh halinden çıkaramam.
Beni kaygıya sürükleyen bu belirsizliği kaldıracak gücüm yok. Kontrolü kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum ve korkuyorum.
Hiçbir şey beni sakinleştirmek için yardımcı olmaz çünkü kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir şeyden zevk alırım. Hiçbir şey onu yatıştıramaz. Sadece geçmesine izin vermelisin ama günler alır. Wtf bu delilik. Hiçbir şey yapamam.
Hayatımın kontrolden çıktığını hissediyorum ve hiçbir şey beni sakinleştiremiyor.
Bunu yaşamam gerektiğini biliyorum ama yine de hiçbir şey hissettiğim bu yoğunluğu azaltamıyor.
Her şey çok fazla ve hiçbir şey beni biraz olsun rahatlatmıyor.
Bu durumun üstesinden nasıl geleceğimi bilmiyorum. Sadece bu fırtınanın geçmesini beklemem gerekiyor.
"İçinde bulunduğum kaosu hiçbir şey durduramıyor, sadece başımın üstünden geçmesini beklemeliyim."
Dönemim boyunca süper depresif olduğum ve ilişkimde ROCD'nin ilk kez ortaya çıktığı kötü bir pmdd bölümü yaşadım... Kendim için endişeliyim ve iyileşmeyeceğimden endişeliyim. Aşkı bulamayacağımdan endişeliyim. Yardıma ihtiyacım var. Umutsuz hissediyorum rn.
Önceden hiç bu kadar kötü hissetmemiştim. Kendimi hiç bu kadar çaresiz hissetmemiştim.
Duygusal olarak çok yıpranmış hissediyorum ve her şeyin daha da kötüye gideceğinden korkuyorum.
"Her şeyden uzaklaşmak ve kaybolmak istiyorum, sadece bu kötü hisleri hissetmek istemiyorum."
Her şey çok ağır geliyor. Hayatta kalmaktan bile yoruluyorum.
Bu duyguyu aşamayacağımı düşünmekten çok korkuyorum. Bunu kimse anlayamıyor.
"Onları yansıtmak, onlarla tanışmak için çabalamak, daha sonra nasıl kısa düştüğümü fark etmek, luteal faz dolduğunda zaten ağır bir deneyime suçluluk ve utanç katmanı ekler. Kafeini tamamen kesmediğim için kendimi suçlu hissediyorum. Sadece yürümek yerine yürümek için. Daha vicdanlıydım, ama * mükemmel * değildim, bu yüzden bunu hak ettim."
"Bu duyguları yansıtmaya çalışmak, onlarla yüzleşmek, sonrasında ne kadar eksik kaldığımı fark etmek, luteal fazın ilerlemesiyle zaten ağır bir deneyime suçluluk ve utanç katmanı ekliyor."
"Kendimi yeterince iyi hissetmediğim, beklentilerimi karşılayamadığım, tam olarak mükemmel olamadığım için kendimi suçlu hissediyorum."
"Her şeyin mükemmel olması gerektiği konusunda kendime koyduğum baskı, bu kadar küçük şeylerde bile, luteal fazın getirdiği duygusal yükü daha da ağırlaştırıyor."
"Kendimi bir 'iyi kız' gibi göstermek için yaptığım tüm çabalar, beklentilerime ulaşamadığımda daha da fazla suçluluk ve utanç hissi yaratıyor."
"Tam olarak istediğim gibi olmasam bile, en azından daha fazla çaba gösterebilirdim, diye düşünüyorum, ve bu da zaten zorlu zamanları daha da kötüleştiriyor."
"Şimdi intihar hissediyorum, vizyonum bulanık ve hala cümleleri doğru bir şekilde bir araya getiremiyorum. Covid'ten önce pmdd belirtilerim susidial fikirsizlik, paranoya, umutsuzluk, kronik yorgunluk, migranlar ve bir sürü başka şeydi."
"Covid'den önce de kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum ama şimdi daha da kötüye gidiyor, kendimi tamamen çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Bu hastalık benim için çok zor, artık hiçbir şey normal değil ve kendimi normale dönmeyeceğimi düşünüyorum."
"Beynim bulanık, vücudum yorgun ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sanki hiçbir şey umut verici değil."
"Covid'den sonra hiçbir şey eskisi gibi değil, hayatımın nasıl böyle bir hal aldığını anlamıyorum."
"Bu hastalık ruh halimi çok etkiliyor, sürekli bir umutsuzluk ve çaresizlik duygusu yaşıyorum."
"Kendimi çok şişmiş hissediyorum ve depresyonum gerçekten kötü, intihar düşüncesi kötü."
"Kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum ve her şey beni çok üzüyor, umutsuzluğa kapılıyorum."
"Son zamanlarda çok kötü hissediyorum, hiçbir şeyden zevk almıyorum, her şey boş geliyor."
"Çok kötü bir ruh halindeyim, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum ve hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor, umutsuzluğa kapıldım."
"Her şey çok ağır geliyor ve hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum, yaşamaktan bıktım."
Terle kaplı olarak uyanıyorum!! Tam anlamıyla bir yüzme havuzuna tamamen giyinik olarak atladığım hissiyle uyanıyorum.
"Çok sıcak ve rahatsız uyandım, sanki tüm gece bir sauna içindeymişim gibi."
Sanki bir maraton koştuktan sonra yatağa yattığımda gibi ter içinde uyandım.
"Uyandığımda üzerimde terden oluşmuş bir tabaka vardı, sanki tüm gece bir buhar banyosu yapmışım gibi."
"Sabahları uyanınca terle ıslanmış bir battaniye içinde buluyorum kendimi, sanki tüm gece ter içinde yatmışım gibi."
"Uyandığımda kendimi terle sırılsıklam hissediyorum, sanki su birikintisinde uyumuşum gibi."
Adetimin 2. günü gibiyim. Uyku saçma. Aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama ben de kimsenin bunu görmesini istemediğim için utanıyorum. Sahip olduğum bir arkadaş gibi hissediyorum. PMDD'nin hala bunu anlamadığını / Konuyu açmayı unuttum. Neden zarafet veriyorum ama bu ay düşündüğümde kendimi gömmek istiyorum. Özellikle PMDD ile her şey daha da kötüleşiyor. CPTSD'ye yardım etmiyor
"İçinde bulunduğum bu hal, adetimin ikinci günü gibi. Uyku saçma sapan geliyor, kendimde değilim. Aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama aynı zamanda bu hissi saklamak için çabalıyorum. Bir arkadaşım olsaydı ona açılırdım."
"Bu dönemde her şey daha zor, adetimin ikinci günü gibi hissediyorum. Uyku uyuyamıyorum, kafam karışık. Aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama bunu kimseye söyleyemiyorum, çok utanıyorum. Sadece bu dönemde kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Adet dönemindeki gibi hissediyorum. Uykuyu unutmuşum, saçma sapan davranıyorum. Aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama bunu kimseye söyleyemiyorum. Bu halde kendimi kötü hissediyorum."
"Bu dönem çok zor geçiyor. Adet dönemindeki gibiyim. Uyku uyuyamıyorum, aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama bunu kimseye söyleyemiyorum. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"İçinde bulunduğum bu hal, adetimin ikinci günü gibi. Uyku uyuyamıyorum, kendimde değilim. Aşık olduğumu düşünüyorum ama bunu kimseye söyleyemiyorum. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
Her ay 10 ila 14 gün boyunca çok yorgunum.
"Aylık olarak, yaklaşık iki hafta boyunca sürekli bir yorgunluk hissediyorum."
"Ayın belirli bir döneminde, yoğun bir yorgunluk yaşayarak 10 ila 14 gün boyunca zorlanıyorum."
"Her ay, 10 ile 14 gün arasında, yoğun bir yorgunlukla mücadele ediyorum."
"Ayın ortalarında, genellikle 10 ile 14 gün arasında, enerji seviyem oldukça düşüyor."
"Aylık olarak, belirli bir dönemde, 10 ile 14 gün boyunca, yorgunluktan dolayı kendimi bitkin hissediyorum."
Adetimden önceki hafta boyunca her ay inanılmaz derecede boş depresif ve endişeli hissediyorum.
"Adet döngümün başlamasından bir hafta önce, bedenimde ve ruhumda bir ağırlık hissediyorum."
"Her ay adet olmadan önceki bir hafta boyunca, dünyanın ağır bir yük gibi üzerime çöktüğünü hissediyorum."
"Adetimden önceki hafta, sinirlerim bozuluyor ve kendime bile tahammül edemiyorum."
"O hafta boyunca her şey gri görünüyor, hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum ve sürekli bir gerginlik yaşıyorum."
"Adet dönemimden önceki hafta, depresif ve endişeli bir ruh haliyle mücadele ediyorum."
"Boğulmuş ve depresif hissediyorum. Dışarı çıkıp bu duygularımı rahatlattığımda, aşırı uyarılmış ve bitkin düşmüşümdür. Bu süre zarfında asla, asla rahat değilim. Lanet olsun sefil. Yalnızım ve sosyalleşmekten bunaldım."
"Duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşıyorum, bir yandan içe kapanıp bunalıma giriyorum, diğer yandan sosyalleşmek isteyip aşırı uyarılmış hissediyorum."
"Hiç rahat edemiyorum, sürekli bir şeylerin peşinde koşuyorum. Sanki kendimle savaş halindeyim."
Bu durumu değiştirmem gerektiğini biliyorum ama bir türlü başaramıyorum. Tek başıma mücadele etmek çok zor.
Mutlu olmak istiyorum ama sanki bunun mümkün olmadığını düşünüyorum. Bu durumdan sıkıldım.
"İnsanlarla zaman geçirmekten kaçınıyorum, çünkü iletişim kurmak beni yoruyor. Kendimi yalnız hissediyorum."
"Aşk hayatımın eksikliğini, özellikle bu zamanlarda insan bağlantısına olan derin arzumu ve asla birlikte olamayacağım birine olan derin özlemimi düşündüm. Onu silmek istiyorum. Spotless zihin tipinin sonsuz bir gün ışığının başıma gelmesini istiyorum, böylece onu tamamen unutabilirim. Bu bağlantıyı ve samimiyeti özlüyorum. Bir gün ya sevgiye ve ilişkilere, belki de evliliğe layık hissetmeye hasretim. Fluctu'yla mücadele etmek kendine saygı duymuyor."
"Bu zamanlarda insan bağlantısına duyduğum özlem,  yüreğimi kemiriyor. Aşk hayatımın boşluğunu hissediyorum, sanki bir parçam eksik gibi."
"Ona olan özlemim o kadar derin ki, bazen soluğum kesiliyor. Kendimi onunla dolu bir hayal dünyasına hapsediyorum, asla gerçekleşmeyecek bir rüya."
"Silmek istiyorum. Onu unutmak, bu boşluğu kapatmak istiyorum. Beynimin temizlenmesini, başıma sonsuz bir gün ışığı gelmesini istiyorum."
"Bu samimiyeti, bu bağlantıyı özlüyorum. Birisiyle gerçekten bağlantı kurmak, paylaşmak, güveni hissetmek istiyorum."
"Bir gün sevgiye layık hissetmek, gerçekten sevilmek, bir ilişki yaşamak istiyorum. Belki de evlilik, belki de bir aile.  Fluctu ile mücadele etmek, kendime saygısızlık olur."
"Her şey beni rahatsız ediyor, her şey beni rahatsız ediyor, hiçbir şey doğru değil."
"Her şey yanlış, her şey yanlış, hiçbir şey yolunda değil."
"Bu dünya dayanılmaz, her şey beni sinir ediyor, hiçbir şey yolunda değil."
"Her şey beni sinirlendiriyor, her şey beni çileden çıkarıyor, hiçbir şey umut verici değil."
"Hiçbir şey beni tatmin etmiyor, hiçbir şey beni rahatlatmıyor, hiçbir şey yolunda değil."
"İnsanlar beni yoruyor, dünya beni yoruyor, hiçbir şey düzgün değil."
"Sinir bozucu oluyorum - luteal fazım sırasında TSSB geri dönüşleri var, bu da beni daha da sinir bozucu yapıyor."
"Luteal fazımda olduğumda, PTSD'den kaynaklanan geri dönüşler beni daha da sinirli hale getiriyor, bu yüzden çok sinir bozucu oluyorum."
"TSSB'den kaynaklanan geri dönüşler, luteal fazımda olduğumda daha da kötüleşiyor ve bu da beni sinir bozucu hale getiriyor."
"Luteal fazım sırasında yaşadığım TSSB geri dönüşleri, beni çok sinirli ve kontrol edilemez yapıyor."
Luteal fazım sırasında yaşanan TSSB geri dönüşleri nedeniyle sinirlerim bozuluyor ve gerçekten huysuzlaşıyorum.
"Luteal fazımda TSSB geri dönüşleri yaşamak, sinirlerimi bozduğu için beni çok sinirli hale getiriyor."
"Ben bencil ve iğrençim, kendimden nefret ediyorum."
"Benim için her şey ben, beni ilgilendiren tek şey kendim."
"Kendimi gerçekten sevmiyorum, içimde sürekli bir boşluk hissediyorum."
"Kimse benimle ilgilenmiyor, sürekli kendimi dışlanmış hissediyorum."
"Her zaman başkalarını suçluyorum, kendi hatalarımın sorumluluğunu almıyorum."
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor, her şeyin kötüye gittiğini düşünüyorum."
"Her şeyi yiyebilecek bir çukur gibi hissediyorum. Neredeyse güvensiz olduğum şeyler yüzünden ayrılmamıza neden olan erkek arkadaşımla patlama kavgalarına başlıyorum... Kendim hakkında o kadar düşük hissediyorum ki, keşke ölseydim diyorum. Bu şekilde hissettiğimde çok fazla içerim çünkü bu işe yaramaz. Kaçamayacağım bir döngü içindeyim."
"Kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum, sanki her şeyi yutacak bir uçurumun kenarındayım."
"Her gün daha da kötüye gidiyorum, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum ve sonunda her şey dağılacak gibi."
"Sanki kendimi paramparça ediyorum, her şeyi mahvetmek üzereyim ve artık kendimi durduramam."
"Kendimde hiçbir iyi şey göremiyorum, sürekli kendimi eleştiriyor ve suçluyorum, sanki sonsuza dek böyle devam edecekmiş gibi."
"Bu durumdan kurtulamayacağım gibi hissediyorum, sanki bir duvarın önünde sıkışıp kalmışım ve kaçış yolum yok."
"PMDD var, bu da bana oldukça yoğun vücut dismorfisine neden oluyor."
"PMDD'nin yoğun vücut dismorfisiyle başa çıkmak zor, bu yüzden terapi ve ilaçlar çok yardımcı oluyor."
"PMDD'nin vücut imajımı gerçekten olumsuz etkilediğini hissediyorum, her zaman kendimi yeterince iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Vücut dismorfisiyle mücadele etmek çok zor, özellikle PMDD'nin tetiklediği zamanlarda."
"PMDD'nin neden olduğu vücut dismorfisi nedeniyle kendimi çok çirkin hissediyorum, kendimi olduğum gibi kabul etmek zor."
"PMDD'nin vücut dismorfisiyle ilgili yaşadığım mücadeleyi anlatmakta zorlanıyorum, gerçekten çok zor."
Aslında geçen gün neredeyse bir hasta ruh sağlığı tesisine gidiyordum çünkü OKB ve TSSB'm benimle kavga ediyordu ve kazanıyordu.
"Geçen gün, anksiyete ve travma duygularım beni gerçekten çok zorluyordu, neredeyse psikiyatra gitmeyi düşündüm."
OKB ve TSSB'nin beni ele geçirdiği hissiyle geçen gün kendimi çok kötü hissettim ve neredeyse bir doktora gittim.
Ruh sağlığı sorunlarımın beni çok etkilediğini hissettim ve geçen gün neredeyse bir uzmana gittim.
"Travma ve takıntılı düşüncelerim, geçen gün beni neredeyse bir ruh sağlığı merkezine gitmeye zorladı."
"Geçen gün OKB ve TSSB'nin kontrolünü ele geçirdiğini hissettim ve bir süreliğine hayatımın alt üst olduğunu hissettim, neredeyse bir uzmana gitmeye karar verdim."
"Sık sık hayatın asla iyileşmeyeceğinden endişe ediyorum. Kendimi çok ağır hissediyorum, sosyalleşmek istemiyorum, ev işleri yapmak istemiyorum, vb. Yorgunluk boğucudur. Her zaman sadece dumanla geçiniyormuş gibi hissediyorum. Sosyal olmaya ilgim yok. Herhangi bir cinsel dürtüm yok. Hayat için sıfır zest'im var. Sadece kendi şartlarımı yeniden doldurabileceğim kendi küçük dünyamda yalnız kalmak istiyorum."
"Yaşadığım bunalım beni tüketiyor, geleceğe dair umudum kalmadı."
"Sıkıntılarım beni esir aldı, hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum, kendime bile."
"Hayatın zorlukları altından kalkabileceğimden şüphe ediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Motivasyonum tamamen tükenmiş, kendimle bile baş edemiyorum, kimseye karşı bir ilgi duymuyorum."
"Ağır bir yük taşıyorum, mutlu olmayı, sosyalleşmeyi, yaşamayı unutmuşum."
Beynimin normal hissettiği çok fazla zamanım yok. Yumurtlama ve lutheal fazım sırasında yaratıcı uğraşlarıma güvenmiyorum. Endişemin hayatımı mahvetmediği sadece bir haftam var.
Hormonal değişimler nedeniyle kendimi pek de verimli hissetmiyorum.
"Yaratıcı olmamı sağlayan birkaç günüm var, geri kalan zamanlarda kendimi çok tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Enerjim ve motivasyonum, ayın belirli dönemlerinde düşük oluyor."
"Kendimi en iyi hissettiğim zamanlar kısa sürüyor, genellikle de çok yoğun oluyorum."
Fiziksel ve duygusal dalgalanmaların hayatımı etkilediği çok fazla zaman var.
"Sadece kendi tenimden atlamak istiyormuşum gibi hissediyorum. Cildim öfke, endişe, üzüntü ile sürünüyormuş gibi. Öfke. Çok ilgisiz ve aşağı hissediyorum... Şu anda insanlar hakkında biraz paranoyak hissediyorum ve bana ulaşmaya çalıştıklarını düşünüyorlar... Sadece korkunç hissediyorum, neredeyse uyuşturucudan veya başka bir şeyden inerken olduğu gibi."
"Kendimi kontrol edemediğim bir haldeydim, sanki vücudum patlama noktasına gelmiş gibi."
"Vücudum öfkeden, kaygıdan ve üzüntüden deliye dönmüş gibi hissediyorum, her şey beni yiyip bitiriyor."
"Çevremdeki her şey beni rahatsız ediyor, kendi kabuğumda sıkışmış gibiyim."
"Çok kırılgan hissediyorum, sanki dış dünyayla bağımı kaybetmişim gibi."
"İnsanlar benimle alay ediyorlarmış gibi hissediyorum, kendimden nefret ediyorum."
Kocanızı terk etmeyin ve dağlarda küçük bir ev satın alın
"Her şeyden önce kendinizi düşünün, rahat bir hayat için her şeyi bırakın ve yeni bir başlangıç yapın."
"Sıkıcı hayatınızdan kurtulun, özgürlüğe kavuşun ve doğanın kucağında huzur bulun."
"Onunla yaşamak zorunda değilsiniz, yeni bir hayata adım atın, dağlarda küçük bir evde kendinizi bulun."
"Hayatınızın kontrolünü ele alın, özgürlüğünüzü geri alın ve dağların dinginliğinde kendinizi yeniden keşfedin."
"Mutsuzluğunuzdan kurtulun, yeni bir maceraya atılın ve doğanın dinginliğinde huzur bulun."
"Ruh hali damlaları, sinirli, sırt ve mide ağrısı. Yumurtlamayı bile fark etmeden önce hissediyorum ve şimdi kendimde tam bir değişim hissedebiliyorum."
"Vücudumda hissettiğim her şey, değişime işaret ediyor, adeta kendimden bir başkasına dönüşüyorum."
"Fiziksel belirtilerin bir karmaşası, duygusal bir değişimin habercisi gibi."
"Sanki vücudumun her hücresi, yeni bir döngünün başlangıcını ilan ediyor."
"İçinde bulunduğum bu durum, bir fırtınanın öncesindeki sessizliği andırıyor."
"Ağrılar, gerginlikler, her şey, yeni bir hayata doğru yol almanın belirtileri."
"Çok yorgunum. Sürekli PMDD durumunda olduğumu hissediyorum. Üçüncü enjeksiyonumu yaklaşık bir ay önce yaptım ve bu korkunç bir şekilde berbat bir şekilde sona erdi. Şimdi östrojen jeli ve mikronize proöstrojen kullanıyorum ve aynı zamanda kötü hissediyorum, endişeli, sinirli, yorgun ve her zaman yırtık."
"Östrojen jeli ve mikronize proöstrojen de işe yaramıyor gibi, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. "
"Bu PMDD durumunda olmak çok zor, her şeyden çok yorgun ve sinirli hissediyorum."
"Üçüncü enjeksiyondan beri sürekli kötü hissediyorum, sanki vücudumda bir savaş yaşanıyor."
"Endişeliyim, yorgunum, sinirliyim, her şey beni yoruyor ve sürekli bir tükenmişlik hissediyorum."
"Bu PMDD beni bitirdi, kendimi sürekli yorgun, yırtık ve endişeli hissediyorum."
Uyanıyorum ve midem dönüyor. Bayılmak ya da kusmak için hafif bir dürtüm var gibi hissediyorum. Beyin sisi ve endişem var ve ayrıca asit reflü alıyorum.
"Uyandığımda mide bulantısı hissediyorum, sanki bayılacak veya kusacakmışım gibi. Beynim bulanık, endişeliyim ve ayrıca asit reflü çekiyorum."
"Sabah uyandığımda kötü hissediyorum. Midem bulanıyor, bayılacak gibiyim ve kusma dürtüsü hissediyorum. Beynim bulanık, endişeliyim ve asit reflüm var."
"Uyandığımda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Midem bulanıyor, kusacağım gibi hissediyorum ve bayılma hissi var. Ayrıca beyin sisi yaşıyorum, endişeliyim ve asit reflüm de var."
"Sabah uyanınca kendimi kötü hissediyorum. Midem bulanıyor, bayılacak gibiyim, kusacak gibiyim ve asit reflü çekiyorum. Beynimde sis var ve çok endişeliyim."
"Uyandıktan sonra kendimi hasta hissediyorum. Midem bulanıyor, bayılacak veya kusacak gibi hissediyorum. Ayrıca beyin sisi, endişe ve asit reflü yaşıyorum."

"Ağlamaktan yoruldum, aklımı kaybedeceğim."
"Daha fazla ağlayamazsam, aklımı kaybedeceğim."
"Ağlamayı bırakamıyorum, aklımı kaybedecek gibiyim."
Bu kadar ağladıktan sonra artık aklımı kaybedeceğimi hissediyorum.
"Ciddi şekilde sinirleniyor ve huysuzlaşıyorum... sadece lanetlenmiş hissettiğim krampları aldığımda, herkesi öldürmek istiyorum ve soo moody oluyorum."
"Adet sancım başladığında gerçekten sinirleniyor ve huysuzlaşıyorum, her şeyi, herkesi parçalayıp atmak istiyorum."
Adet döneminde olduğumda kendimi çok sinirli ve huysuz hissediyorum. Sanki herkesi öldürmek istiyorum.
"Her ay aynı şey, adet olduğumda o kadar sinirli ve huysuzlaşıyorum ki... Sanki tüm dünyayı yerle bir etmek istiyorum."
Kramplarım başladığında çok sinirleniyor ve huysuzlaşıyorum... Sanki tüm dünyaya karşı savaş açmak istiyorum.
"Sanki kendimde değilim, kramplar başladığında o kadar sinirleniyor ve huysuzlaşıyorum ki herkesi öldürmek istiyorum."
"Merhaba, ben bir sanatçıyım ve PMDD uzun yıllar beni son derece perişan etti."
"Selam, ben bir yazarım ve endişe bozukluğum uzun yıllar beni çok zorladı."
"Merhaba, ben bir müzisyenim ve depresyon uzun yıllar beni paramparça etti."
"Selam, ben bir programcıyım ve obsesif kompulsif bozukluğum uzun yıllar beni perişan etti."
"Merhaba, ben bir ressamım ve anksiyete uzun yıllar beni çok zorladı."

14 günlük PMDD planındayım.
14 günlük PMDD planımdan sonra daha iyi olacağıma inanıyorum.
"Bu 14 günlük PMDD planı, hayatımı değiştirmeyi umuyorum."
14 günlük PMDD planıyla daha sağlıklı ve mutlu olmayı hedefliyorum.
14 günlük PMDD planı benim için zorlu ama faydalı olacağına inanıyorum.
Umarım bu 14 günlük PMDD planı benim için işe yarar.
Geçen hafta düşüncelerimle ve ruh halimle mücadele ediyordum ve bu sabah gerçekten kötüleşti. Daha sonra bölümümden bir saat sonra kanamaya başladım ve ruh halim tekrar ortaya çıkmaya başladı. Ruh halimin bu şekilde ne kadar hızlı değiştiği çok ani ve garip
"Geçen hafta, duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşıyordum ve bugün sabah daha da kötüleştim."
"Duygularımla mücadele ettiğim bir dönemdeydim, bugün sabah her şey daha da kötüleşti."
Bu hafta duygusal olarak zorlandım ve bu sabah gerçekten kötüye gitti.
Kendimi duygusal olarak iyi hissetmiyordum ve bu sabah daha da kötüleştim.
"Geçtiğimiz günlerde duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşıyordum, bu sabah da bu durum daha da kötüleşti."
Bir haftadan fazla semptomlarım var.
Birkaç gündür kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum.
Hastalığım bir haftadan fazla sürüyor.
Belirtilerim geçmek yerine kötüleşiyor.
Bu rahatsızlık beni bir haftadan fazla rahatsız ediyor.
Bir haftadan fazla süredir bu belirtilerle mücadele ediyorum.
Son zamanlarda bunun düzensiz/kaçırılmış bir yumurtlamayla bağlantılı olup olmadığını merak ediyorum... Son döngüm 50 gündü ve gerçekten herhangi bir şeyin geldiğine dair fiziksel bir belirtim yoktu.
"Son döngüm 50 gün sürdü ve bu oldukça olağandışı, sanki vücudum kendi ritmini kaybetmiş gibi."
"Normalde düzenli bir döngüm var ama son 50 gündür hiç bir şey olmadı, bu biraz endişelendirmeye başladı."
"Son zamanlarda regl olmamın çok gecikmesinden dolayı, sanki bir şeylerin ters gittiği hissine kapıldım."
"Son döngüm 50 gün sürdü, bu bana bir sorun olup olmadığını merak ettirdi."
"50 gün boyunca adet görmemek beni endişelendiriyor, sanki bir şeylerin yolunda gitmediği hissine kapıldım."
Benim için bir numara yapacağını bildiğim ek stres
Güvendiğim tek kişi olduğun için sana bunu soruyorum.
"Tek umudum sensin, bu yüzden seni hayal kırıklığına uğratmamanı umuyorum."
"Bu konuda sana güvenmem gerek, bu yüzden lütfen beni başa çıkaramaz hale getirme."
"Senden başka kimseye gidemem, lütfen beni mahcup etme."
"Tek umudum sensin, bu yüzden beni hayal kırıklığına uğratmamanı umuyorum."
Huzursuz hissediyorum.
"Rahatsızım, bir şey beni tedirgin ediyor."
İç huzursuzluğum beni rahatsız ediyor.
"Bir türlü sakinleşemiyorum, içimde bir huzursuzluk var."
Kendimi huzursuz ve tedirgin hissediyorum.
"İçime sinmeyen bir şey var, huzursuz hissediyorum."
"Etkiler oyalanıyormuş gibi hissediyorum... Kendimi delikten çıkarmak biraz zaman alıyormuş gibi. Sürekli araştırıyorum ama okuduğum her şey PMDD ile ilgili olmayabilir diyor ama gerçekten biliyor muyuz???... Bununla uğraşmaktan ve bunun ne zaman, nasıl ya da ne kadar zor olacağını bilmemekten yoruldum."
"Bu belirtiler geçmek bilmiyor, sanki her şey yerleşmesi için zamana ihtiyaç duyuyor."
"Kendimi bu karanlık tünelde kaybolmuş gibi hissediyorum, çıkış yolu bulmak çok zor."
"Araştırıyorum, okuyorum, ama cevapları bulmakta zorlanıyorum, her şey çok belirsiz."
"Bu durumla mücadele etmek çok yorucu, sürekli belirsizlik içinde olmak çok zor."
"Ne zaman düzeleceğim, ne zaman rahatlayacağım, bu belirsizlik beni tüketiyor."
Geçen ay bir araba kazasına neden oldum. Bu ay paranoyaklaştım ve yeni arkadaşımın beni zehirlemeye ve soymaya çalıştığını düşündüm. Yakında çok kötü bir şey olacağından endişeliyim.
Son zamanlarda çok kötü bir şans dizisi yaşadım ve hayatımın kontrolden çıktığını hissediyorum.
"Kendimi çok kırılgan ve savunmasız hissediyorum, her şeyin bana karşı olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Geçen ayki kaza beni gerçekten sarsmış ve bunun üzerine bir de bu yeni endişeler çıktı, uyuyamıyorum bile."
"Her şeyi çok ciddiye alıyorum, sanki her an bir felaket yaşanacakmış gibi."
"Bu kötü şansın bitmesini, sakinleşip hayatıma kaldığım yerden devam etmeyi istiyorum."
Göğsümdeki derin acılı üzüntü dalgalarıyla bütün gün durmadan ağlıyorum... Sadece böyle hissediyorum. Göğsüm üzüntüden fiziksel olarak acıyor. Yemek istemiyorum. Kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum. Duygularımı yönetmeye ve her zamanki gibi iş yapmaya çalışıyorum ama ne hissettiğimin bir önemi yok.
"Ağlamaktan yorgunum ama üzüntü durmuyor, içimde bir boşluk var ve hiçbir şey dolduramıyor."
"Sanki göğsümde taşlar var, her nefes alışımda daha da ağırlaşıyorlar, konuşamıyorum, hareket edemiyorum."
"Fiziksel olarak hissettiğim bu acı beni tüketiyor, sanki kalbimin her atışında bir bıçak saplanıyor."
"Duygularımı kontrol edemiyorum, etrafımdaki insanlar bana garip bakıyor ama içimde fırtınalar kopuyor."
"Sadece sessizliğe bürünmek istiyorum, yalnız olmak, çünkü her ses, her soru, her bakış bu acıyı daha da derinleştiriyor."
Ağlamayı kesmeyin herkes bir şey yapamaz. Im 802837472 pound gibi terliyorum. Gerçekten deliriyorum.
"Bu kadar üzgün olmayın, herkes aynı şekilde hissetmiyor. Ben de gerçekten çok stresliyim."
Sizi anlıyorum ama herkesin aynı durumda olmadığını unutmayın. Ben de şu sıralar çok bunalmışım.
"Ağlamak size iyi gelir,  bir şey yapamazsanız da. Ben de şu anda çok zor durumdayım."
Herkesin aynı şekilde hissetmediğini hatırlayın ve üzüntünüzü bastırmayın. Ben de şu an çok bunalmış durumdayım.
"Üzüntünüzü görmezden gelmeyin, herkes aynı şeyi hissetmiyor.  Ben de şu an çok stresliyim."
"O kadar siki tuttum, o kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar siki tuttum, o kadar siki tuttum, o kadar siki tuttum, o kadar siki tuttum ki, ondan nefret ettim, o kadar siki tuttum ki..."
"O kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim, o kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim, o kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim, o kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim, o kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim ki, o insanın varlığından nefret ettim, o kadar çok sıkıntıya girdim ki..."
"O kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar çok gözyaşı döktüm, o kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar çok acı çektim, o kadar çok acı çektim ki, sonunda ondan nefret etmeye başladım, o kadar çok acı çektim ki..."
"O kadar çok zorlandım, o kadar çok çaba sarf ettim, o kadar çok zorlandım, o kadar çok zorlandım, o kadar çok zorlandım, o kadar çok zorlandım ki, sonunda vazgeçtim, o kadar çok zorlandım ki..."
"O kadar çok güvendim, o kadar çok inanç besledim, o kadar çok güvendim, o kadar çok güvendim, o kadar çok güvendim, o kadar çok güvendim ki, sonunda hayal kırıklığına uğradım, o kadar çok güvendim ki..."
"O kadar çok sevdim, o kadar çok özledim, o kadar çok sevdim, o kadar çok sevdim, o kadar çok sevdim, o kadar çok sevdim ki, sonunda o sevgi bana acı verdi, o kadar çok sevdim ki..."
Bugün beynim her yerde. Sakin gibi görünmüyorum... Bir şekilde hayatımı çevirebileceğime beni ikna eden bir enerji patlaması yaşıyorum.
"Bugün kendimi inanılmaz enerjik hissediyorum, sanki her şey mümkünmüş gibi."
"Yaratıcılığım bugün zirvede, aklımda sayısız fikir dönüp duruyor."
"Enerjiyle doluyum, sanki dağları yerinden oynatabilecekmişim gibi."
"Bir şeylere başlamak için can atıyorum, tüm bedenim heyecanla dolu."
"Bugün her şey yolunda gidecek gibi hissediyorum, sanki kader beni bir maceraya davet ediyor."
"Kendimi her zaman açıklamak zorunda kalmaktan bıktım, sadece yalnız kalmak istiyorum, sefil olduğum kadar"
"İnsanların sürekli beni anlamalarını beklemelerinden bıktım, sadece kendimle olmak istiyorum, sefil olduğum kadar."
"Beni sürekli sorguluyorlar, yargılıyorlar, açıklamalarımı bekliyorlar... Yeter artık, sadece yalnız kalmak istiyorum, sefil olduğum kadar."
"Kendimi savunmak zorunda kalmaktan yorulduğumu hissediyorum, sadece kendimi kabul etmek istiyorum, sefil olduğum kadar."
"Artık kimseye bir şey kanıtlamam gerekmiyor, sadece kendimi kabul ettiğim gibi olmak istiyorum, sefil olduğum kadar."
"Her zaman kendimi başkalarına anlatmak zorunda kalmaktan bıktım, kendimi sefil olduğum gibi, sadece kabul etmek istiyorum."
"Tamamen olumsuz bir düşünce spiraline ve gerçekten ""yetişkin"" şeyler yapma yeteneğimi etkileyen çok düşük benlik saygısına sahibim... Şu anda dönemimdeyim ve hatta bir saç randevusunu arayamıyorum ve programlayamıyorum çünkü tek düşünebildiğim kötü bir sonuç, saçlarımın mahvolacağı vb."
Düşük benlik saygım yüzünden kendimi sürekli eleştiriyorum ve hayatın basit görevlerini bile yerine getirmekten kaçınıyorum.
Benlik saygımın bu kadar düşük olması her şeyde başarısız olacağımı düşünmeme sebep oluyor ve hayatı yaşamaktan zevk almamı engelliyor.
En basit görevleri bile tamamlayamadığım için kendimden tiksiniyorum ve bu durum hayatımın her alanını etkiliyor.
"Kendimi sürekli eleştiriyor ve yeteneksiz hissediyorum, bu yüzden hayatı yaşamak yerine kendimi geride tutuyorum."
Kendim hakkında sürekli olumsuz düşünmek beni felç ediyor ve en temel ihtiyaçlarımı bile karşılamaktan alıkoyuyor.
Dün gece ilişkim hakkında çok sinirlendim ve paranoyaklaştım. Hemen sonra özür diledim ve sonra ağlamaya başladım.
Dün gece ilişkimde yaşananlar yüzünden çok endişelendim ve kafam karıştı. Sonra hemen özür diledim ve gözyaşlarıma hakim olamadım.
İlişkimizdeki sorunlar beni dün gece çok rahatsız etti ve kendimi güvensiz hissettirdi. Hemen özür diledim ve duygularımı kontrol edemeyip ağlamaya başladım.
Dün gece tartışmamız beni çok üzdü ve endişelendirdi. Hemen özür diledim ama duygularımla baş edemeyip ağlamaya başladım.
Dün gece ilişkimiz hakkında çok düşünerek kendimi kötü hissettim ve endişelenmeye başladım. Hemen özür diledim ve duygularımı tutamayıp ağlamaya başladım.
İlişkimizde yaşadığımız sorunlar beni dün gece çok üzdü ve korkuttu. Hemen özür diledim ve sonra ağlamaya başladım.
Dün korkunçtu. Görünürde bir sebep yokken kızgın ve üzgün uyandım. Etrafımdaki herkese kızdım. Aç hissetmeme rağmen yemek yemedim çünkü bu 'akıllar' sırasında sık sık kendimi açlıktan dolayı cezalandırmak istiyorum....Akşamları bir sisin indiğini ve her şeyin boğulduğunu hissettim ve tamamen tepkisiz kaldım.... Sadece biraz rahatlama getiren tek şeyin ölümümün resimleme olduğunu hissettim.
"Dün yaşadığım her şey anlamsızdı. Hiçbir şeyden keyif alamadım, her şey boş ve anlamsız geldi."
Günün başlangıcı bile benim için olumsuzdu. Adeta kendimle savaş halindeydim.
Kendimle ilgili kötü düşüncelerle uyanmak ve etrafımdakileri suçlamak beni daha da kötü hissettirdi.
"Açlığı kullanarak kendimi cezalandırmak, bugünlerde başa çıkmak için benim için bir mekanizma haline geldi."
"Her şeyin grileşmesi, hayatın anlamını kaybetmesi ve bunun karşısında çaresiz kalmak beni dehşete düşürüyor."
"Bugün benim için sadece zor bir gündü. Ev sahibimden gelen rastgele bir 900 dolarlık ücret bana tamamen spiral gibi görünüyor ve sadece hissettiğim umutsuzluk ve öfke eşsizdi. Sadece bütün gün hıçkırıyordum ve işten çıkmak zorunda kaldım. Bc.'yi çalışamam. Piyasadaki en güçlü antidepresanların bile bana yardım edemeyeceğini düşünüyorum, ne olacak?"
"Bugün sadece kötü günlerden biriydi. Ev sahibimden gelen beklenmedik 1000 dolarlık fatura beni tamamen alt etti ve sadece umutsuzluk ve öfke hissettim. Bütün gün ağladım ve işten ayrılmak zorunda kaldım. Konsantre olamıyorum. Bana yardımcı olabilecek hiçbir şey yok gibi görünüyor, ne yapacağım?"
Hayat gerçekten zor. Beklenmedik bir 500 dolarlık fatura beni tamamen şok etti ve bugün sadece hıçkırarak ağladım. Hiçbir şey mantıklı gelmiyor ve kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum. Devam edeceğimi sanmıyorum. 
Bu sadece çok fazla. Ev sahibimden gelen 900 dolarlık ücret beni tamamen alt etti ve sadece yapabileceğim şey ağlamak. Bu ücretin nedenini anlamıyorum ve bunun için ödeyecek param yok. Bu haksızlık.
Bazen gerçekten bunalıyorum. Her şey o kadar çok ki. Sadece hıçkırarak ağlayabiliyorum. Bugün işten ayrılmak zorunda kaldım. Kendimi toparlayamayacağımı hissediyorum.
Kendimi tamamen çaresiz hissediyorum. Ev sahibimden gelen 900 dolarlık ücret beni tamamen alt etti ve sadece ağlayabiliyorum. Bu ücretin nedenini anlamıyorum ve bunun için ödeyecek param yok. Bunu aşacağımı sanmıyorum.
PMDD'm beni her ay aktif olarak intihara meyilli yapıyor. Bu yüzden bölümlendim ve aynı zamanda temelde evde intihar nöbetindeyim. Kaygım daha da kötüleşiyor (zaten şiddetli) çalışamayacağım noktaya kadar. Tüm umudum gidiyor. Geçmişim beni rahatsız ediyor. Düşüncelerime direnmek gittikçe zorlaşıyor.
PMDD'nin beni her ay aktif olarak intihara meyilli yapması beni çok korkutuyor.
Bu PMDD bölümleriyle başa çıkmak gerçekten çok zor. Beni tamamen mahvediyor.
Benim gibi hissettiğimi bilen başka biri var mı? sanki kendimde değilim.
Her ay aynı dehşeti yaşamak gerçekten de beni tüketiyor.
"Bu duyguyu tarif edemiyorum, sanki kendi bedenimde değilmişim gibi hissediyorum."
Uteruslarımız da var ve PMDD'yi de sakatlayabiliriz. T'de olumlu deneyimler yaşayan ve PMDD'lerine yardım eden biri olup olmadığını görmek için bu Reddit'teydim.
"Bu hastalıkla başa çıkmak için birlikteyiz, çünkü bu hastalığı biz kadınlar yaşayabiliyoruz ve bunun üstesinden gelebiliyoruz."
PMDD'nin bedenimizde yarattığı acıya rağmen güçlü kadınlarız ve bu hastalığı yenmek için birbirimize destek olabiliriz.
Bu rahatsızlığı yaşayan herkesin deneyimleri önemli ve bu yüzden bu konuda birbirimize destek olmak için bir araya gelmeliyiz.
T'nin PMDD semptomlarına iyi gelip gelmediğini merak ediyorum çünkü bunu deneyimleyen tek kişi ben değilim ve bu hastalığı atlatmanın bir yolu olmalı.
"Bu hastalıkla ilgili deneyimlerimizi paylaşarak ve destekleyerek, PMDD'nin etkilerinden kurtulmanın yolunu bulabiliriz."
Bugün bokumu kaybettim. Genç kızımın önünde kocama bağırdım. Bütün gün çok fazla müdahaleci düşüncem oldu. Kendimi odamıza kilitledim ve kimseyle herhangi bir temas istemiyorum. Suçlulukla doluyum. Bir canavar gibi hissediyorum.
Bugün her şeyi berbat ettim. Kızımın önünde kocama bağırdım ve o kadar kötü hissediyorum ki kendimi odama kapatmak istedim.
"Çocuklarımın ve kocamın önünde bağırıp çağırdım. Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki bütün ailemden kopmuşum gibi."
Çok büyük bir hata yaptım ve kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. Tüm gün aklımı kurcalayan düşüncelerle boğuştum.
Bugün kendimi tamamen kaybettim ve herkesi incittim. Çok pişmanım ama kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Her şeyi mahvettim. Kendimi kontrol edemedim ve şimdi kendimi berbat hissediyorum. Kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum.
Arzularım çok kötü ve ayda 2-3 gün sürüyor. Her zaman biliyorum çünkü bir anda hayattaki tek amacım soğuk ve meyveli bir şey tüketmek. Eğer sahip olamazsam ruh halimi mahveder. Berry smoothies ve şerbetler benim anamdır. Düşünebildiğim tek şey bu.
"Gündelik hayattaki en büyük derdim tatlı krizleri, birden bire aklımı başımdan alıp sadece soğuk ve meyveli bir şeyler istememe neden oluyorlar."
"Aşırı bir şekilde tatlı sevdiğim için, ayda birkaç gün sadece soğuk, meyveli içecekleri düşünebiliyorum, aksi halde kendimi kötü hissediyorum."
"Bir anda tüm varlığımı saran bu tatlı isteğiyle mücadele etmek gerçekten zor, hayatımda tek istediğim şey o an soğuk bir şerbet veya meyveli içecek oluyor."
"Her zaman tatlı isteği duyuyorum ama en kötüsü ayda birkaç gün boyunca tamamen başka hiçbir şeyi düşünemiyorum, soğuk ve meyveli bir şey yemeden kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum."
"Bana sürekli olarak tatlı ihtiyacı duymamın neden olduğunu bilmiyorum ama her ay birkaç gün boyunca sadece soğuk ve meyveli içecekler istiyorum, aksi halde ruh halim bozuluyor."
"Adetimden 2 hafta sonra her zaman mutlak kaos vardır. Şiddetli anksiyete, panik ataklar, aşırı uyku, işe geç kalmak, bayılmak, araba sürerken, kulak çınlarken nöbet geçireceğime kendimi ikna etmek ve çok daha fazlası."
"Adetimden hemen önce ve sonraki haftalar benim için hep zorlu geçer, sanki bedenim savaş halindeymiş gibi."
"Adet dönemim her zaman hayatımı altüst eder, sanki üzerime bir karanlık bulut çökmüş gibi."
"Adetimden sonraki günlerde kendimi çaresiz hissederim, sanki vücudumun kontrolünü kaybetmişim gibi."
"Adet dönemim bittikten sonraki haftalar genellikle yorgunluk, sinirlilik ve uykusuzluk ile gecer."
"Adet dönemim her zaman beni duygusal olarak yıpratır, sanki bir fırtınanın ortasında kalmışım gibi."
hemen mutlu ve içerikten siktiğimin teninden atlamak gibi hissetmeye geçti
"Aniden, içimde tarifsiz bir mutluluk ve huzur dalgası esti ve kendimi dünyanın zirvesinde hissettim."
"Sanki bir anda tüm dertlerim unutulmuş gibi, mutluluk ve rahatlama dalgaları üzerime çöktü."
"Bir anda içimde bir coşku patlaması yaşandı, sanki tüm yüküm bir anda kalkmış gibiydim."
"Bir anda uçmaya hazır hissettim, o kadar mutlu ve huzurluydum ki sanki dünyanın tüm güzelliklerini içinde barındırıyordum."
"O an sanki tüm olumsuzluklar yok olmuş, yerini tarifsiz bir mutluluk ve rahatlama hissi almış gibiydi."
"İş arkadaşım günde en az 20 kez parmaklarını çatlatıyor, şaka yapmıyorum. Bu iğrenç ve kendi cildimden sürünmek istememe neden oluyor."
"İş arkadaşımın sürekli olarak kahve içmesi beni delirtiyor, sürekli olarak makinenin sesini duymak zorunda kalıyorum."
"İş arkadaşımın çalışma masasında sürekli olarak müzik açması ve dans etmesi çok rahatsız edici, ofise konsere gelmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"İş arkadaşımın sürekli olarak burnunu karıştırıp elini yıkamadan işe devam etmesi midemi bulandırıyor, o ofisteyken nefes alamıyorum."
"İş arkadaşımın sürekli olarak ofiste gevrek sesleri çıkartarak yemesi beni çıldırtıyor, sanki bir inşaat sahasında çalışıyormuşum gibi hissediyorum."
"İş arkadaşımın sürekli olarak telefonunda videolar izleyerek sesli bir şekilde gülmesi ve herkesi rahatsız etmesi çok sinir bozucu, herkesin dikkatini dağıtıyor."
Kendimden nefret etmeye başlamıştım çünkü sadece var olan diğer insanlara ne kadar sinirlenirdim.
Başkalarına olan sinirlerim beni kendime karşı öfkelendirmişti.
Varoluşları bana o kadar sinir bozucu geliyordu ki kendime karşı da kötü hissetmeye başlamıştım.
Kendimi sorgulamaya başlamıştım çünkü sadece diğer insanların varlığı beni çileden çıkarıyordu.
"Diğer insanların varlığına olan öfkem, kendime duyduğum saygıyı sarsıyordu."
Sadece başkalarının varlığına sinirlendiğim için kendimi berbat hissetmeye başlamıştım.
O ruh hallerinden birine girdim.
Bu günlerde sıkça yaşadığım o hisse kapıldım.
O tanıdık duygu yine beni ele geçirdi.
Yine o melankoli dolu ruh haline büründüm.
Kendimi o alışılmış depresyonun pençesinde buldum.
O garip his tekrar beni sarmaladı.
Sürekli boğazını temizliyor
Boğazında sürekli bir tıkanıklık hissediyor.
Bir şey var gibi sürekli öksürüyor.
Boğazında bir şey takılı kalmış gibi.
Sürekli öksürük nöbetleri geçiriyor.
Boğazı sürekli rahatsız ediyor.
"Bir keresinde tam anlamıyla son apt'imde küvette oturmak zorunda kaldım, gürültü beni deli ediyordu."
"Benim de böyle bir tecrübem var, taşınma gününde tam da en yorgun olduğum an kocaman bir taşınma kamyonu binamın önünde uzun süre korna çaldı."
"Geçen hafta sonu tam da iyi uyuyacağım zaman komşuların yaptığı gürültü beni uyandırdı, inanılmaz sinir bozucuydu."
"Yorgun olduğum zamanlarda en ufak bir ses bile beni deli ediyor, sanki beynimde çınlıyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Birkaç hafta önce apartmanda tam da çalışmaya başladığım zaman gürültülü bir inşaat başladı, odaklanmak neredeyse imkansızdı."
"İnsanların gürültüsünden kaçıp sakinleşmek için gittiğim doğa yürüyüşünde bile bir grup genç gürültü yapmaya başladı, gerçekten sinir bozucuydu."
Komşumun çocuğunun gürültülü ve sinir bozucu ıslığı ve dörtlü biniciliği yüzünden öldürmek istiyorum.
Komşumun çocuğunun bağırmaları ve sürekli koşuşturması beni çıldırtacak hale getirdi.
"Komşumun çocuğu sürekli gürültü yapıyor ve beni sinir ediyor, artık dayanamıyorum."
"Komşumun çocuğunun bağırmaları ve oyunları yüzünden huzurum kaçtı, sürekli bir kaos var."
"Çocuğun gürültüsü ve hareketliliği beni çok rahatsız ediyor, sanki evimde huzur kalmadı."
"Komşumun çocuğu sürekli gürültü yapıyor ve bu benim işime yaramıyor, artık bir çözüm bulmam gerekiyor."
Bütün gün kulaklarıma bir şey takmaktan nefret ediyorum. Bu kadar hassas olduğumda sık sık eve erken gitmeye çalışırım.
"Gürültülü ortamlar beni çok yoruyor, bu yüzden genellikle sessiz ve sakin yerlerde vakit geçirmeye çalışırım."
"İnsanların sürekli konuştuğu ortamlarda kendimi rahatsız hissediyorum, bu yüzden mümkün olduğunca tenha yerlerde bulunmayı tercih ediyorum."
"Çok fazla sese maruz kaldığımda başım ağrıyor, bu yüzden sessiz yerlere çekilmeye çalışıyorum."
"Gürültü, konsantrasyonumu bozduğu için, sessiz bir ortamda çalışmayı tercih ediyorum."
"Çok fazla sese maruz kaldığımda huzursuz oluyorum, bu yüzden mümkün olduğunca sakin yerlerde vakit geçirmeye çalışıyorum."
Her şey ıslak ve ağır. Denemek için zaman harcıyorsun!
Yağmur yağıyor ve her şey sırılsıklam. Şimdi işe koyulmalıyız!
"Bu son yağmurun her şeyi ıslattığına bakılırsa, dışarıda daha fazla zaman geçirmeyi düşünmüyorum."
"Her şey ıslak, her şey ağır, bugün dışarıda hiçbir şey yapmak için uygun bir gün değil."
"Güneşli bir gün olsaydı, daha rahat çalışırdık ama her şey ıslak ve ağır. Yine de devam etmeliyiz!"
"Bu yağmurdan sonra her şey nefes almakta zorlanıyor, sanki her şey ıslak ve ağırlaşmış gibi."
Duyusal aşırı yüklenme bazı günler sadece cildimi koparıp onunla dans etmek istememe neden oluyor.
"Duyusal aşırı yüklenme, beni her şeyden kaçıp bir dağa tırmanıp sessizliğe gömülecek kadar bunaltıyor."
"Bazı günler duyusal aşırı yüklenme o kadar yoğunlaşıyor ki, kendimden kaçmak istiyorum."
"Duvarlara bakıp durmaktan, sürekli gürültüden ve aşırı uyarıcıdan bıktım."
"Bu duyusal aşırı yüklenme beni bunaltıyor, sadece kendime zaman ayırmak ve sakinleşmek istiyorum."
"Her şeyden uzaklaşmak, sadece sessiz bir ormanda yürüyüş yapmak istiyorum, duyusal aşırı yüklenmeden uzak kalmak istiyorum."
Bu şekilde çalışmaya geri dönebileceğimi hiç sanmıyorum
Artık bu şekilde çalışamam diye düşünüyorum.
Bu işin bana göre olmadığına karar verdim.
Bu tarz bir işe bir daha asla geri dönmem.
Eskisi gibi çalışmam mümkün değil.
Bu şekilde devam edemeyeceğimi düşünüyorum.

Şu anda ruh evresinin karanlık yolcusuyum ve çaresizlik gerçek. Ağzımla ve çevremdeki her şeyle ilgili bir ED ve tonlarca travmam var...
Şu anda hayatın karanlık bir yolculuğunda olduğunu hissediyorum ve çaresizliğin gerçekliği beni sarıyor.
Bu dönemde derin bir ruhsal bunalım içindeyim ve hissettiğim çaresizlik gerçek bir yük.
Ağzımla ve çevremle ilgili yaşadığım travmalar beni derinden etkiliyor ve ruh halimi karanlığa sürüklüyor.
Kendimle mücadele ettiğim bu karanlık yolculukta çaresizlik beni ele geçirmiş durumda ve travmaların yükünü taşıyorum.
Bu ruhsal evreden geçerken çaresizlik ve travmanın yaraları beni derin bir yalnızlığa sürüklüyor.
Kendi yolumda çalışmaktan ve şirketimde daha iyi bir ödeme pozisyonu almaktan korkuyorum çünkü 2 haftalık yorgunluk sırasında yorgunken işi yapamazsam ne olur? Çok fazla hata yaparsam ne olur?
Daha fazla sorumluluk almak için gerçekten can atıyorum ama iş yükünün beni yutacağından korkuyorum.
"Bu yeni pozisyon için çok heyecanlıyım, ancak bu kadar yoğun çalışma saatlerine ayak uydurabileceğimden emin değilim."
Aslında bu terfiyi çok istiyorum ama bu kadar büyük bir sorumlulukla başa çıkabileceğimden emin değilim.
Yeni bir işe başlamaktan heyecan duyuyorum ama iş temposunun beni alt edeceğinden endişeleniyorum.
Kariyerimde ilerlemek istiyorum ama o kadar yoğun çalışmak zorunda kalacağım diye korkuyorum.
"Öyle gördüm ki, daha iyi olmadan önce (çok) daha da kötüleştiğini ve / veya ilk çekimlerinden sonra aylar boyunca her gün PMDD semptomları olduğunu söyleyen kimyasal menopoza giren insanlardan çok fazla hikaye gördüm ve sadece... bunu kaldırabileceğimi sanmıyorum. Ama aynı zamanda, bunu her ay zar zor atlatabiliyorum. Önümüzdeki 20+ yıl boyunca ayda bir kez olabileceğini bilmek iç karartıcı."
"Kendimi bir çember içinde döndüğümü hissediyorum, iyileşmeden önce her şey daha da kötüleşiyor ve bilmiyorum ki bunu kaç kere daha kaldırabilirim."
"Daha önce kimyasal menopoza girmiş insanlarla konuştuğumda, her ay bu PMDD semptomlarıyla mücadele etmeleri gerçekten beni ürkütüyor."
Bu durumun her ay devam etmesi düşüncesi bile beni yıldırdı. Nasıl 20 yıl daha böyle yaşayacağım?
"İlk başta her şey daha da kötüleşecekmiş gibi hissetmek çok yıpratıcı, ama sonra iyileşeceğim diye umut ediyorum. Bu döngüyü kırmak zor."
"Kimyasal menopozun bana bu kadar zorlu bir dönem yaşatacağını hiç düşünmemiştim, her ay bu kadar güçlü hissetmek gerçekten beni korkutuyor."
"Birkaç gün önce bir panik atağına uyandım... bu gece boğazımda garip bir his hissettim ve panik vurdu. Sağlık kaygım pmdd sırasında çok kötüleşiyor, farklı hisseden veya tadı farklı olan küçük bir şey vücudumun alarmını başlatabilir."
"Geçen hafta da böyle olmuştu, kendimi kötü hissetmeye başlayınca hemen panikledim, sanki bir şey ters gidiyormuş gibi."
"Hiçbir şey yokken bile, birdenbire endişelenmeye başlıyorum, vücudum bana bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu söylüyor."
"Önceden böyle değildim, her şey çok çabuk kötüleşiyor, her şeyden korkmaya başladım."
"Kendimi biraz farklı hissediyorum, bu da hemen aklıma kötü olasılıkları getiriyor, sanki bir hastalık başlangıcıymış gibi."
"Gece yarısı uyanıp, kalbim hızla çarpmaya başlayınca her şeyin kötüye gittiğini düşünüyorum, hiçbir şeyin iyi gitmediği hissine kapılıyorum."
Kendimi lanet olası bir kurt adam gibi hissediyorum.
Kendimi resmen bir canavar gibi hissediyorum.
"Bu hissi tarif edemiyorum, sanki bir canavarın bedenine hapsolmuşum gibi."
"İçinde olduğum bu duyguyu hiçbir şeye benzetmiyorum, tamamen yabancı."
Kendimi tamamen kontrolsüz ve vahşi hissediyorum.
Sanki içimdeki bir canavar dışarı çıkmak için mücadele ediyor.
"PMDD belirtileri alevlendiğinde, kendim olmadığımı hissediyorum, ki gerçekten üzücü buluyorum. Sevilmemek ya da sahip olmayı seçmediğim bir şey yüzünden ayrılmanın nedeni olmak acı verici."
PMDD'nin getirdiği ruh halindeki değişimler beni bambaşka bir insana dönüştürüyor ve bu da beni gerçekten çaresiz hissettiriyor.
"Bu dönemde kendimi tanıyamadığımı hissediyorum, bu da beni çok üzüyor. İnsanların beni sevmemesi ya da benim seçmediğim bir şey yüzünden benden uzaklaşması dayanılmaz bir acı."
Bu ruh halindeki değişimler beni tanıdığım kişiden çok farklı biri gibi hissettiriyor ve bu da benim için çok zorlayıcı. Sevilmemek veya kendi isteğim dışında terk edilmek çok acı verici.
"Sanki bedenim ve ruhum bu dönemde kontrolümü ele geçiriyor ve bu beni çok mutsuz ediyor. İnsanların bana karşı bu dönemde farklı davranması,  sevilmemek beni çok üzüyor."
PMDD'nin getirdiği duygusal dalgalanmalar beni kendimden uzaklaştırıyor ve bu da beni çok rahatsız ediyor. Terk edilme korkusu ve sevilmemek beni gerçekten çok etkiliyor.
"Ruh halim, dönemimden 3 gün sonra olabileceğim kadar aşağıda ve pmdd beni buraya getirdi."
"Duygusal olarak çok kötü hissediyorum, dönemimden 3 gün sonra hissedebileceğim kadar kötü, ve pmdd bu kötü ruh halimin nedeni."
"Dönemimden 3 gün sonra, kendimi her zamankinden daha kötü hissediyorum, ve pmdd kesinlikle bu durumun sebebi."
"Ruh halim şu an alt seviyede, dönemimden 3 gün sonra hissedildiği gibi, ve pmdd bu durumun sorumlusu."
"Kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum, dönemimden 3 gün sonra hissedebileceğim kadar kötü, ve pmdd bu ruh halimin sebebi."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, dönemimden 3 gün sonra olabileceğim kadar kötü, ve pmdd bu hisleri tetikleyen şey."
"Ben sadece hiçbir yedek planı ile işimden izin gitti, neredeyse kendimi bir akıl hastanesine kontrol, ve şimdi burada progesteron krem sürtünme ve benim intihar fikri korkunç olmuştur olarak Pepcid AC alarak. Ben bu kadar çok devre dışı ve hayatımı mahvediyor nefret ediyorum."
"İşimi, hiçbir planım olmadan bıraktım, neredeyse akıl hastanesine yatışa zorunlu kaldım ve şimdi kendimi kötü hissederek progesteron kremi sürüyor ve Pepcid AC alıyorum.  Bu kadar kötü hissetmekten ve hayatımı mahvetmekten nefret ediyorum."
"Hiçbir şey planlamadan işten ayrıldım ve kendimi gerçekten kötü hissettim, neredeyse akıl hastanesine yatışa zorunlu kaldım. Şimdi de progesteron krem sürüyorum ve Pepcid AC alıyorum, intihar etmek benim için korkunç bir fikir gibi geliyor. Bu kadar çaresiz hissetmek ve hayatımı mahvetmekten nefret ediyorum."
"İşten çıktım, hiçbir şey planlamamıştım, kendimi gerçekten kötü hissettim ve neredeyse akıl hastanesine yatırıldım. Şimdi progesteron krem sürüyorum ve Pepcid AC alıyorum, kendimi kötü hissediyorum, intihar bile yapmak korkunç bir fikir gibi geliyor.  Bu kadar kötü hissetmekten ve hayatımı mahvetmekten nefret ediyorum."
"Hiçbir planım olmadan işten ayrıldım, neredeyse akıl hastanesine yatışa zorunlu kaldım ve şimdi progesteron krem sürüyorum ve Pepcid AC alıyorum.

"İşten ayrıldım, hiçbir planım yoktu, kendimi çok kötü hissettim ve neredeyse akıl hastanesine yatışa zorunlu kaldım. Şimdi progesteron krem sürüyorum ve Pepcid AC alıyorum, intihar düşüncesi bile korkunç. Bu kadar kötü hissetmekten ve hayatımı mahvetmekten nefret ediyorum."
"Nadiren ağlıyorum, çoğu durumda üzgün olmak yerine sinirleniyorum. Hiçbir şey olmadı bile, sadece ağlamayı durduramıyorum. Burnum o kadar tıkandı ki, ağzımdan elle nefes almak zorundayım, şu anda beni rahatlatacak hiçbir şey düşünemiyorum. Genellikle sadece depresyona giriyorum ve kanamadan önce yaklaşık bir hafta boyunca uyuşuyorum. Ama şu anda sıcak gözyaşı akışlarım var."
"Genellikle ağlamaktan çok sinirlenirim, ama bugün farklı. Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum ve ağlamayı durduramıyorum."
"Ağlamak için hiçbir sebep yok gibi gözükse de, içimde bir üzüntü var. Burnum tıkalı ve ağzımdan nefes almak zorunda kalıyorum. Rahatlayamıyorum."
"Normalde kendimi depresif hisseder ve uyuşuklaşırım, ama şu anda farklı. Sıcak gözyaşlarım akıyor."
"Bazen hiç ağlamadan sinirlenerek geçiştiririm, ama bugün ağlamak dışında başka çarem yok gibi hissediyorum."
"Şu an ağlamaktan başka hiçbir şey düşünmek istemiyorum. Bu duygu, öfke değil, acı gibi. Nefes alamıyorum."
"Depresyon, ptsd, pmdd teşhisi konulan 17 yaşındaki kız. Çocukluk ihmali, fiziksel istismar ve cinsel istismarın tarihi, fiziksel yakınlık korkusuna neden olur. Asla gerçek arkadaşlara sahip olmadı, sadece bir kez bağlantı hissetti ama batırıldı. Asla romantik bir ilgi görmedi, asla el ele vermedi. Üzülün. İnternette yaşlı erkekleri cinselleştirmeden cinsel dikkat çekin, utanıyor ve suçlu hissediyorum. Güvensiz, sosyalleşmede kötü, normal olmak istiyor."

"Çok şiştim, son zamanlarda kilo aldım ve bu beni çok büyük gösteriyor ve güvenimi ve sosyal kaygımı etkiliyor."
Kendimi şişman hissediyorum ve bu benim özgüvenimi ve sosyal hayattan çekinmemi etkiliyor.
Son zamanlarda kilo aldım ve bunun beden imajımı ve sosyal kaygımı etkilediğini düşünüyorum.
Kilo aldığımdan dolayı kendimi büyük ve rahatsız hissediyorum ve bu da sosyal ortamlarda daha gergin olmama neden oluyor.
Kendimi kilolu hissediyorum ve bu benim dış görünüşümle ilgili kaygılarımı ve sosyal etkileşimlerdeki güvensizliğimi artırıyor.

"Korkunç, zayıf, yorgun hissediyorum.... Hiç arkadaşım yok, işim yok, hiçbir şey için motivasyonum yok, ödeme faturaları ve para yok.... Aydan 3-5 gün boyunca kendimi iyi hissediyorum ve sefil bir insan olmaya geri dönüyorum.... Şimdi sadece sefil hissediyorum, boş ve hayatta tamamen kayboldum. Bunun üzerimde yarattığı acı ve zihinsel etkiden bıktım."
"Hayatımda her şey yolunda gitmiyor, kendimi yalnız, çaresiz ve tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Çalışmak için enerjim yok, arkadaşlarım da yok, sadece bir boşluk hissediyorum."
"Kendimi sürekli başarısız ve mutsuz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey için motivasyonum yok, tüm umudumu kaybettim."
"Bu durum beni çok yordu, sürekli olarak kayıp ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Kendimi çökmekte olduğunu hissediyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor, sadece bu acıdan kurtulmak istiyorum."
"Kendime zarar verme ve nüksetme dürtüsüyle mücadele etmek için en zor zamanlarım var... Neredeyse eroin için bir satıcı bulduğum noktaya kadar son derece kötüleşen intihar düşüncelerim var, yeterince eroinle aşırı doz almayı denemek için. Bu düşünceler şu anda gerçekten kötüleşiyor ve PMDD'si nedeniyle muhtemelen bunu bilsem de, onları görmezden gelmekte zorlanıyorum."
"Kendime zarar verme dürtülerini yenmek ve tekrarlamaktan kaçınmak için mücadele etmek inanılmaz derecede zor. İntihar düşüncelerim çok kötüleşmişti, neredeyse eroinle aşırı doz alarak ölmek için bir satıcı arıyordum."
"İntihar düşüncelerim beni ele geçiriyor, neredeyse intihar edecek kadar kötüleşiyor ve kendime zarar verme dürtüsünü bastırmak çok zor. "
"Bana yardım etmeye çalıştığın için teşekkür ederim, kendime zarar verme dürtülerim ve intihar düşüncelerim beni kontrol ediyor ve her geçen gün daha da kötüleşiyor."
İntihar düşüncelerim ve kendime zarar verme dürtülerim tekrar baş gösterdi ve neredeyse intihar ederek bunlardan kurtulmayı düşündüm.
Geçtiğimiz birkaç hafta boyunca kendime zarar verme dürtülerim ve intihar düşüncelerimle boğuşuyorum. Neredeyse bir satıcı bularak eroinle aşırı doz almayı düşünüyordum.
PMDD pre-testosteron vardı - sadece korkunç depresyon ve anksiyete öncesi dönem. Aslında geçen gün HORRIBLY depresif ve cinsiyet-dizforik hissederken oldukça ciddi bir şekilde ayrıldım.
"PMDD, adet öncesi dönemde aşırı depresyon ve anksiyete yaşamamı sağlayan bir hormonal bozukluk."
Geçen gün yaşadığım korkunç depresyon ve cinsiyet disforisi beni gerçekten yıktı.
"Bu PMDD döneminde, sadece derin bir depresyona değil, aynı zamanda yoğun bir cinsiyet disforisine de kapılıyorum."
"Önceden testosteron alıyordum, fakat bu PMDD semptomları, özellikle de depresyon ve anksiyete, her zaman beni perişan ediyor."
"Aslında, bu PMDD döneminde yaşadığım depresyon ve cinsiyet disforisi o kadar şiddetliydi ki neredeyse ayrılmayı düşünüyordum."
Endişeler can sıkıcı. Bugün ülke genelinde uçuşların nasıl iptal edildiğini duyunca heyecanlandım. PMDD'm kendi baloncuğumda olmak istememi sağlıyor.
"Endişeler beni her zaman rahatsız ediyor, özellikle de bugün ülke genelinde gerçekleşen uçuş iptalleri hakkında haberleri duyduğumda."
Bugün uçuşlar iptal edildiğinde çok endişelendim ve PMDD'm de zaten beni biraz çökertti.
"Endişelerimin ve PMDD'min birleşmesi, beni şu anda dış dünyadan tamamen kopmak istememe neden oluyor."
Bu ülke genelindeki uçuş iptalleri beni çok stresli hissettirdi ve PMDD'min beni daha da kötüleştirdiğini hissediyorum.
"Şu anda evimde kalıp kendi halime bırakılmak istiyorum, özellikle de bugün uçuş iptalleri duyduktan sonra."
"PMDD'nin en kötü lanet kısımlarından birinin müdahaleci düşünceler olduğunu görüyorum. Daha hassas olmak. Her şey lanet rahatsız olmak ve sonra sooo lanet olmak zorunda eklemek... kasıtlı ama düşüncelerimle ve eylemlerimle zarif.. ""Kendime odaklanmama izin vermeli miyim / buna yer vermeli miyim?"
"PMDD'nin en kötü yanı, bu sürekli beni kontrol altına alma isteği, her şeyi abartma ihtiyacı ve sürekli 'bunu yapmalı mıyım, yapmamalı mıyım' diye düşünmek."
"En kötü kısım, kendimi kontrol edemediğim, her şeyden rahatsız olduğum ve bunu aşırı abarttığım hissi. Her şeyin 'doğru' olması gerektiği, aksi takdirde suçluluk duyduğum düşüncesi."
"Bu müdahaleci düşünceler, sanki her şeyden rahatsız olmak ve bunu abartmak zorundaymışım gibi. Hep 'kontrolü kaybetmek'ten korkuyorum."
"En kötü şey, kendimi kontrol edemediğim, her şeye aşırı tepki verdiğim hissi. Sanki ben kendim değilim ve düşüncelerimi durduramam."
"PMDD'nin en kötü kısmı, sanki düşüncelerim beni ele geçiriyor gibi. Her şeye aşırı tepki veriyorum ve kendimi kontrol edemiyorum. Sürekli bir mücadele."
"Ayın o tatlı yerindeyim ve eğer bu hastalığa sahip olmasaydım ne olabileceğimi bilmek gerçekten kalbimi acıtıyor... Ne yapabileceğimi, vücudumun ve benim neler yapabileceğimi biliyorum ve PMDD beni bundan mahrum ediyor."
Hayatımın en güzel anlarını yaşıyorum ve bu hastalık olmasaydı neler başarabileceğimi hayal etmek bile canımı sıkıyor.
"Eğer bu hastalık olmasaydı neler yapabileceğimi düşünmek beni üzüyor. Gerçekten kendimi ifade edebiliyor, potansiyelimin tamamını ortaya çıkarabiliyordum."
"Bedenim ve zihnimle neler yapabileceğimi biliyorum, ama bu hastalık beni engelliyor ve hayallerimi gerçekleştiremememi hissediyorum."
"Bu hastalık olmasaydı, enerjimi ve yaratıcılığıma daha fazla odaklanabilirdim. Şimdi ise sadece mücadele ediyorum."
"Ne kadar güçlü olduğumu, ne kadar yaratıcı olabileceğimi biliyorum, ama bu hastalık beni her seferinde engelliyor."
"Bunun yardımcı olması gerektiğini biliyorum, ancak yaklaşık 7 ay sonra neredeyse daha da kötüleştiğini fark ediyorum."
Bu işe yaramaz diye düşünmüştüm ama durumun daha da kötüleştiğini fark ettim.
Yardımcı olacağını ummuştum ama durum gittikçe daha da kötüleşiyor.
"Daha iyi olması gerekiyordu, ancak durum daha da kötüye gidiyor."
"Olumlu bir değişiklik beklemiştim, ancak hiçbir sonuç göremiyorum."
Durumun düzeleceğini düşünüyordum ancak daha da kötüleşiyor.
"SSRI ile bunu durdurmama neden olan kötü yan etkilerim var. Önceden var olan PMDD semptomlarım kötüleşti (dikkat, duygusal düzenleme, SI. PMDD semptomlarım şu anda zaten oldukça kötü, 'Eh, BC ile bile ne kadar kötü olabilir?' diye düşünüyorum."
"SSRI'lar bana çok fazla yan etki veriyor, özellikle PMDD semptomlarımı daha da kötüleştiriyor."
SSRI'lar yüzünden daha önce yaşadığım PMDD semptomları daha da şiddetlendi ve artık kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum.
"Bu ilaç yüzünden konsantrasyon, duygusal düzenleme ve intihar düşünceleri gibi PMDD semptomlarım çok daha belirgin hale geldi."
"SSRI'ların PMDD semptomlarımı daha da kötüleştirdiğini düşünüyorum, özellikle de dikkati, duygusal düzenlemeyi ve intihar düşüncelerini etkilemesi beni endişelendiriyor."
"PMDD semptomları zaten çok kötüydü, ancak SSRI'lar onları daha da kötüleştirdi, neredeyse dayanılmaz hale geldi."
yememin kontrolünü kaybetti... bunun rastgele bir kalıp olduğunu düşünüyor. Ona ne olduğunu açıkladığımda...
"Yeme alışkanlığımı kontrol edemiyorum, bu tamamen rastgele bir davranışmış gibi düşünüyor."
"Bu yiyecek bağımlılığım çok garip, sanki rastgele bir kalıp gibi davranıyormuşum."
"Yemek yeme konusunda kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, bunun sebebini araştırmak için bir kalıp aramaya çalışıyorum."
"Yemek yemeyi bırakamadığımın sebebini anlamıyor, sadece rastgele bir şeymiş gibi düşünüyor."
"Aşırı yemek yediğimi, bir kalıba bağlı davranıyormuş gibi düşünüyor, bu konuda onu bilgilendirmem gerekiyor."
"Sabahları tuvalette baygınlık / kan basıncında düşme, dönemim boyunca ağrı / rektum sorunları, bunun endometriozise mi yoksa olası bir kistle mi bağlantılı olduğunu merak ediyor"
"Sabahları tuvalette baş dönmesi yaşıyorum, regl dönemlerimde de ağrılarım oluyor, rektumda da sorunlar yaşıyorum, acaba endometriozis mi yoksa kist mi olabilir diye merak ediyorum."
"Son zamanlarda sabahları tuvalette baygınlık geçiriyorum, regl dönemlerimde de ağrılarım çok şiddetli, ayrıca rektumda da sorunlar yaşıyorum, bu belirtiler endometriozis veya kist ile ilgili olabilir mi acaba?"
"Sabahları tuvalette baygınlık geçirmem, regl dönemlerimde şiddetli ağrılarım olması ve rektumda sorunlar yaşamam beni endişelendiriyor, endometriozis veya kist olabilir mi?"
"Sabahları tuvalette baygınlık geçirmek, regl dönemlerimde ağrı ve rektumda sorunlar yaşamak endometriozise veya bir kiste bağlı olabilir mi, bu konuda endişeliyim."
"Sabahları tuvalette baygınlık geçirme, regl dönemlerinde ağrı ve rektumda sorunlar gibi belirtiler yaşamam, endometriozis veya kist olabileceği ihtimalini aklıma getirdi."
"Geçen hafta beni deli ediyor ağlamayı kesmiyor ve herkesin benden nefret ettiği gerçek sanrılar, kabızlık, rahatsız uyku ve düşük iştah"
"Son zamanlarda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, her şey beni sinirlendiriyor, sürekli ağlamak istiyorum ve herkesin beni sevmediği hissine kapılıyorum. Üstelik kabızlık, uykusuzluk ve iştahsızlık da cabası."
"Geçen hafta berbat geçti. Her şey beni çileden çıkarıyor, ağlamaktan kendimi alamıyorum ve sanki herkes benden nefret ediyormuş gibi hissediyorum.  Üstelik kabızlık, uykusuzluk ve iştahım da tamamen kapandı."
"Kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum.  Her şey beni sinirlendiriyor, sürekli ağlamak istiyorum ve kimse beni sevmiyor gibi hissediyorum.  Üstelik kabız, uyuyamıyorum ve yemek yiyemiyorum."
"Son birkaç gündür sürekli kötü hissediyorum.  Her şey beni deli ediyor, ağlamaktan kendimi alamıyorum ve sanki herkes benden nefret ediyormuş gibi hissediyorum. Üstelik kabızlık, uykusuzluk ve iştahım da tamamen kapandı."
"Kendimi berbat hissediyorum.  Sanki her şey beni sinirlendiriyor, sürekli ağlamak istiyorum ve herkes benden nefret ediyor gibi hissediyorum. Üstelik kabız, uyuyamıyorum ve yemek yiyemiyorum."
Gerçekten şikayet etme ve luteal sırasında daha genel olarak kabul edilemez olma yükümlülüğümün ortağım için büyük bir acı noktası olduğu gerçeğini kabul ediyorum.
Luteal fazda yaşadığım şikayetlerin ve genel kabul görmememin eşim için fazlasıyla can sıkıcı olduğunu fark ediyorum.
"Eşimin, luteal fazda yaşadığım şikayetler ve olumsuzluklarla baş etmekten oldukça zorlandığını anlıyorum."
"Gerçekten, luteal dönemdeki huysuzluğumun ve şikayetlerimin eşim için bir yük olduğunu kabul etmek zorundayım."
"Eşimin, luteal fazda yaşadığım duygusal iniş çıkışlara ve genel olarak zorlu geçmesine sabırla katlanması oldukça zor."
Luteal fazda yaşadığım sıkıntılar ve olumsuz ruh halimin eşimin sabrını zorladığını kabul etmekten kaçınmak mümkün değil.
"Tüm sabrımı kaybediyorum ve 'Siktir et! Artık sikimde değil' demek çok kolay, sonra toz yerleştikten sonra hemen pişman oluyorum. Bugün kendimden nefret ediyorum. PMDD'den nefret ediyorum. Hayatımız üzerindeki etkisinden nefret ediyorum."
"Sabrımın son damlası taştı, 'Siktir et!' demek çok kolay ama sonra pişman oluyorum, kendimle kavga ediyorum."
"Her şeyden bıktım, 'Siktir et!' diyip çekip gitmek çok cazip geliyor ama sonra ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Her şeyin yolunda gitmemesi, tüm sabrımı tüketti, 'Siktir et!' demeden kendimi durduramıyorum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, 'Siktir et!' diye bağırarak her şeyi bırakmak istiyorum, sonra pişmanlık geliyor."
"Bu öfkeyi kontrol edemiyorum, 'Siktir et!' diye bağırıp çağırmak istiyorum ama kendimi durdurmam gerekiyor."
En küçük oğlum 2003'te doğduğundan beri pmdd ile uğraşıyorum... 'normal' günlerde bile büyük depresyonla mücadele ediyorum.
"İkinci oğlum dünyaya geldiğinden beri, her gün yoğun bir kaygı ve üzüntüyle mücadele ediyorum."
Küçük kızım doğduktan sonra sürekli bir yorgunluk ve ruh halimde iniş çıkışlar yaşıyorum.
En büyük oğlumun doğumundan beri kaygı bozukluğu ile mücadele ediyorum ve çoğu zaman kendimi tükenmiş hissediyorum.
En küçük çocuğum doğduğundan beri kendimi sürekli bir kaos içinde hissediyorum ve çoğu zaman umutsuzluğa kapılıyorum.
"Çocuklarımın doğumu hayatımda büyük bir mutluluk kaynağı oldu, ancak aynı zamanda ciddi bir ruhsal mücadeleye de yol açtı."
"Adet dönemim gelene kadar PMDD'den kaçınmak için takviyeye başladım tüm uyarı işaretlerim var ve biliyorum ki menstruasyon yapmak üzereyim, ama..."
PMDD belirtileri başlamadan önce takviye almaya başlamalıyım çünkü vücudum bana adet dönemimin yakında olduğunu söylüyor.
"Adet olmak üzere olduğumu hissettiğim anda, PMDD belirtilerini önlemek için takviye almaya başlıyorum."
"Adet dönemimin yaklaşmakta olduğunu biliyorum, bu yüzden PMDD'den kaçınmak için takviyelerimi alıyorum."
"Adet dönemim gelene kadar PMDD'den kaçınmak için kendimi hazırlamalıyım. Tüm belirtiler orada, vücudum bana ne olacağını söylüyor."
"Herhangi bir PMDD semptomu yaşamadan önce kendimi rahatlatmak için takviyeleri kullanıyorum, çünkü adet dönemim çok yakında."
Görünürde her şeyi yiyormuşum gibi hissediyorum ve kilomu korumaya çalışmak istiyorum. Mart ayından bu yana 10 kilo aldım.
"Çok fazla yediğimi hissediyorum ve kilo almaktan korkuyorum, Mart ayından beri 10 kilo aldım."
"Her şeyi yediğimi hissediyorum ve kilo almaktan korkuyorum, Mart ayından beri 10 kilo aldım. Kilo vermek istiyorum."
"Fazla yiyorum ve kilo almak istemiyorum, Mart ayından beri 10 kilo aldım."
"Son zamanlarda aşırı yediğimi düşünüyorum ve kilo vermek istiyorum, Mart ayından beri 10 kilo aldım."
"Kilo almaktan korkuyorum, her şeyi yediğimi hissediyorum ve Mart ayından beri 10 kilo aldım."
"Banyo zemininde hiperventilasyon geçirdiğim 2 zihinsel çöküntü yaşadım. CPTSD ve DEHB'm var, bu yüzden kötü bir sosyal kaygım ve kontrolden çıkma korkum var. Yani stres seviyem neredeyse 3 hafta boyunca 7/24 yükseldi."
"Banyo zemininde çöküşlerim, hayatımın kontrol edilemez olduğuna dair içgüdüsel bir korku hissettiği zamanlardı."
"DEHB ve CPTSD'nin getirdiği sosyal kaygı ve kontrolsüzlük korkusu, stres seviyemi sürekli artırıyor."
"Yüksek stres seviyem, kontrolsüz panik atakları ve zihinsel çöküşlere yol açıyor."
"Son 3 haftadır, kendimi sürekli bir panik halinde, her an çökme korkusu içinde buluyorum."
"Banyo zemininde iki kez çöküşüm yaşadım, her ikisi de kontrolü kaybetme korkusuyla tetiklendi."
"Bir içerik ve endişe karışımı hissettim. Zihinsel olarak ilk hafta, hayal ettiğimden çok farklıydı... ilk birkaç gün, duygularımla çok yukarı ve aşağı indim. Geceleri, bu yoğun panik anlarını yaşardım... Gece terlemeleri de İNTENSE... Bunu garanti etmeyen şeyler yüzünden kesinlikle aklımı kaybederdim. TF'nin bunu neden yaptığımı ve kocama HRT'yi durdurduğumu söylediğimi hatırlıyorum..."
Bu yeni başlangıçta hem heyecan hem de kaygı hissettim. Hayal ettiğimden çok farklıydı.
İlk birkaç gün duygusal iniş çıkışlar yaşadım. Her şey çok yoğun geldi.
"Gece geç saatlerde panik atakları yaşıyordum, gece terlemeleri inanılmazdı."
"Bu durumun sebepsi beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor, kendimi kaybediyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"TF'nin bunu neden yaptığını anlamıyorum, neden kocama HRT'yi durdurduğumu söylediğimi bile bilmiyorum."
"Düşüncelerim her yerde, ""Kalkmak zorundasın, bu seni kontrol edemez"" ile ""Hiçbir gücüm kalmadı, hiçbir şey umurumda değil, herkesten nefret ediyorum, artık burada olmak istemiyorum"" arasında gidip geliyor. Kendimi tamamen izole edip kapatıyorum."
"Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum, tek istediğim her şeyden uzaklaşmak."
"Sanki içimde iki farklı ses çarpışıyor, biri mücadele etmem gerektiğini söylerken diğeri pes etmemi."
"Bu yoğun duyguların arasında kayboluyorum, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, her şey çok yorucu."
"Her şey çok zor, kendimi yapayalnız ve umutsuz hissediyorum, bu yükün altında eziliyorum."
"Benimle savaşan bu iki zıt düşünce, beni sürekli olarak yıpratıyor, kendimden uzaklaşıyorum."
"Rahatsız edici bir şekilde üzülüyorum ve o kadar sinirleniyorum ki bir şeyleri kırdım. Arabalarımın dikiz aynasını söktüm çünkü kredi kartımı unuttum ve Walmart'ın ödeme yapacak bir musluğu yok, böylece herkes artık aptal olduğumu düşünüyor."
"Kendimi aptal gibi hissediyorum, kendimi aptal gibi gösteriyorum ve şimdi her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
"Son derece sinirli ve hayal kırıklığına uğramıştım ve kendimi aptalca davrandım, bu da daha da çok aptalca davranmama neden oldu."
Duygusal olarak bunaldım ve bunu yaparken kendimi aptal gibi gösterdim.
Böyle saçma bir şey yaparak herkesi düşündüğümden daha aptal gibi gösteriyorum.
Bu kadar kötü hissetmem beni aklımı kaybetti ve aptalca hareketler yaptım.
"Sorum şu ki... Bundan nefret ediyorum, gerçekten ruh sağlığımı etkiliyor. 12 yaşımdan beri kendimi biseksüel olarak görüyorum ve her 3-4 haftada bir sorgulamak zorunda kalmak cehennem. Adetim bittikten sonra olduğu gibi sadece %100 biseksüel hissediyorum."
"Bu sürekli sorgulanan hissi bir türlü kabullenemiyorum, hayatımı etkiliyor."
"Her seferinde kendimle yüzleşmek çok yorucu, adeta kim olduğumu sorgulamaktan bıktım."
"İnsanlar biseksüel olmakta zorluk çekenleri anlamıyor, sanki bu bir tercihmiş gibi."
"Yaşadığım bu ikilemi kimse anlamıyor, kendimi hep açıklamak zorunda kalıyorum."
İstediğim tek şey kendimi rahat hissetmek ve kim olduğumu sorgulamaktan kurtulmak.
"Ben yasal bir panik atak vardı ve dağa çıkarken erime - benim kalp atış hızı aşağı alamadım, depresif spiral çok yakın okşayan oldu, çirkin gözyaşları ve sümük yüzümden akarken, etrafımdaki kuşlara ve ağaçlara lanet kelimeleri mırıldanıyor - tüm o shebang. Bu benim için ""tabii için uygun"" cehennem haftası belirtileri - bir dağda yürüyüş yaparken tüm bunları yaparken, duygusal olarak, hayatımın çok zaman geçirmemem gerekirken?"
"Benim için gerçekten kötü bir hafta ve duygusal olarak hayatımın çok zaman geçirmemem gerektiği bir zamanda, bir dağ yürüyüşünde gerçek bir panik atak geçirdim. Kalp atış hızımı kontrol edemiyordum ve depresif bir spirale girmek üzereydim. Gözyaşlarım ve sümük akarken, etrafımdaki kuşlara ve ağaçlara kötü sözler söylüyordum."
Çıplak bir panik atak geçirdim ve kalp atış hızımı durduramadım. Depresif bir spirale çok yakındım ve gözyaşlarım yüzümden akarken kuşlara ve ağaçlara kötü sözler söylüyordum. Bu benim için çok zor bir haftaydı ve hayatımda gerçekten çok fazla şey vardı.
"Dağa tırmanırken gerçekten kötü hissediyordum. Kalp atışım kontrolden çıktı ve kendimi çok kötü hissettim. Gözyaşlarım ve sümük akarken, etrafımdaki ağaçlara ve kuşlara sövdüm. Hayatımda çok fazla şey oluyor ve bu hafta özellikle zordu."
"Benim için kötü bir hafta ve kalp atış hızım kontrolden çıktı ve depresif bir spirale girmek üzereydim. Ağladım, sümüküm aktı ve kuşlara ve ağaçlara kötü sözler söyledim. Bu benim için gerçekten kötü bir hafta ve hayatımda gerçekten çok fazla şey vardı."
"Çok kötü bir panik atak geçirdim ve kalp atış hızımı kontrol edemiyordum. Ağladım, sümüküm aktı ve kuşlara ve ağaçlara sövdüm. Hayatımda çok fazla şey oluyor ve çok yorgunum."
O kadar duygusal olarak müsait değil ve kapalı ki... ilişkide sorunlarımız olduğunda onu her zaman açmak ve neyin yanlış olduğunu tahmin etmek zorundayım çünkü duygularını paylaşmaktan tamamen aciz... ayrıca sekse ve dokunmaya karşı bir nefreti var.
"Onu gerçekten tanıyamadığımı hissediyorum, sanki içine kapanmış ve beni uzak tutuyor."
"İletişim kurmaya çalıştığımda hep duvar örüyor, sanki duygularını benimle paylaşmak istemiyor."
"İlişkimizde bir sorun olduğunda, her şeyi kendim çözmeye çalışıyorum, çünkü o asla hislerini ifade etmiyor."
"Duygusal olarak o kadar mesafeli ki, bazen kendimi ilişkinin tek tarafını çeken benmişim gibi hissediyorum."
"İlişkimiz soğuk ve uzak, sanki o artık bana yakın olmak istemiyor."
"Yeni teşhis edildim. Ot (hafta sonları rekreasyonel) ve alkolü bırakma üzerinde çalışıyorum. Kahveyi minimumda tutmak, muhtemelen luteal faz üzerinde Decaf'a gitmek. DEHB için her gün Wellbutrin 300 alıyorum. Lexapro 10'u luteal fazda başlatıyorum."
Yeni teşhis edildim ve hayatımı yeniden düzenlemeyi deniyorum.
Alkol ve ot içmeyi bırakmak zor ama bu benim için en iyisi.
DEHB için Wellbutrin kullanıyorum ve ruh halimi düzenlemeye yardımcı olması için Lexapro'yu luteal fazda alıyorum.
Sağlığım için en iyi seçimlerimi yapmaya çalışıyorum.
İlaçlarımı düzenli olarak kullanmaya ve yaşam tarzımı değiştirmeye çalışıyorum.
"Herkesin benden nefret ettiğini ve yapmam gereken her şeye ayak uyduramadığımı hissediyorum. Yorgun hissediyorum ama aynı zamanda çok endişeliyim. Kendimi yalnız hissediyorum, sanki bir yük gibiyim ve kimse beni sevmiyor. Hiç arkadaşım yokmuş gibi hissediyorum ve işteki herkes benden nefret ediyor."
"Kendimi sürekli bir başarısızlık gibi hissediyorum, sanki herkes benim üzerimde bir baskı hissediyor."
Çalışma arkadaşlarımla iletişim kurmakta zorlanıyorum ve sanki herkes benimle iletişim kurmaktan kaçınıyor.
"İş yerinde kendimi değersiz hissediyorum, sanki varlığım bile bir yük gibi."
"Kendimi dışlanmış ve yalnız hissediyorum, sanki kimse benimle arkadaş olmak istemiyor."
"Bu yalnızlığı kaldırabileceğimden emin değilim, sanki kendimi çökmek üzere gibi hissediyorum."
"ter onun koşmak. Saç şimdi Frizz, neredeyse aşağı yüz makyaj"
"Ter onun koşmak nedeniyle yüzünde. Saçı şimdi kabarık, neredeyse yüzüne yapışıyor."
"Koşudan dolayı ter yüzünü kaplamış. Saçları kabarık, yüzüne değmek üzere."
"Koşarken ter yüzünü kaplamış. Saçları kabarık, yüz makyajını bozacak gibi."
"Koşmaktan dolayı yüzü ter içinde. Saçları dağınık, yüzüne doğru iniyor."
"Koşudan terliydi ve yüzü ter içindeydi. Saçları dağınık, yüz makyajını bozmak üzereydi."
Bugün kötü bir gün geçirdim ve sadece anneme telefon hıçkırarak olmuştur... Görünüşe göre ben sadece adet öncesi olduğumda yaptığım belirli bir ağlama var?!
"Bugün çok kötü bir gündü, annemle telefonda ağladım durdum. Sanırım PMS'li olduğumda böyle ağlamaklı oluyorum."
Hayatımın en kötü günlerinden birini geçirdim ve tek yaptığım annemi arayıp hıçkırarak ağlamak oldu. Sanki PMS'li olduğumda ağlama krizi geçirmek için bir sebep arıyormuşum gibi.
Gerçekten kötü bir gün geçirdim ve tek yapabildiğim annemle telefonda ağlamak oldu. Herhalde PMS'li olduğum zaman böyle ağlama nöbetleri geçiriyorum.
Bugün berbat bir gün geçirdim ve sadece annemi arayıp hıçkırıklarla ağladım. Belki de PMS'li olduğumda böyle bir ağlama huyu var.
Gerçekten çok kötü bir gün geçirdim ve yapabildiğim tek şey annemi arayıp hıçkırarak ağlamak oldu. Sanırım PMS'li olduğum zamanlarda kendimi daha kolay ağlatıyorum.
Sağ tarafta keskin bir göğüs ağrısı var.
Sol tarafımda da benzer bir ağrı hissediyorum.
"Bu ağrı, derin bir nefes aldığımda daha da artıyor."
Ağrının nedeni hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok.
Sanırım bir doktora görünmem gerekiyor.
Ağrı gerçekten çok şiddetli.
Ben sefil bir pisliğim.Kendimi bile bilmiyorum ya da kendim açıklayamıyorum.Neye ihtiyacım olduğunu söyleyemem çünkü neye ihtiyacım olduğunu da bilmiyorum!
"Kendimle ilgili hiçbir şey bilmiyorum, bu yüzden kendimi tanımlayamıyorum."
İçimde boşluk var ve neyle dolduracağımı bilmiyorum.
"Kayıp gibi hissediyorum, kim olduğumu veya nereye gittiğimi bilmiyorum."
"Yaşamımda hiçbir anlam göremiyorum, sadece boşluk ve anlamsızlık hissediyorum."
"Ne aradığımı bile bilmiyorum, bu yüzden ne istediğimi de söyleyemiyorum."
Dün tek yapmak istediğim ağlamak ve uyumaktı. Birkaç iş uygulaması ve oğlum için planlanmış bir şey vardı. Dün her şeyi başarmak için zorladım.
"Dün kendimi çok yorgun hissediyordum ve sadece dinlenmek istiyordum, ama yapmak gereken birkaç şey vardı."
"Günün başında her şeyi yapmaya karar vermiştim, ama yorgunluktan kendimi zorlamak zorunda kaldım."
"İstediğim tek şey yatakta kalmaktı, ama günün planları vardı ve zorlu bir gün geçirdim."
"İşler ve oğlumun planları beni zorladı, ama bugün sadece dinlenmek istiyordum."
"Uyumak ve ağlamak benim tek isteğim olmasına rağmen, dün işleri halletmek için kendimi zorladım."
"Genel olarak bir şeyler yapmak zor, kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum."
"Genel olarak, her şey karmaşık görünüyor ve kendimi bunalmış hissediyorum."
"Hayatın genelinde yolumu bulmakta zorlanıyorum, her şey çok kafa karıştırıcı."
Bir şeyi başarmak için çok fazla şey yapılması gerekiyor ve kendimi yorgun hissediyorum.
"Bu hayatta kendime bir yer bulmakta zorlanıyorum, hedeflerim belirsiz."
Her şey belirsiz ve kendimi bu yolculukta yalnız hissediyorum.
"Sürekli yetersizlik, değersizlik ve düşünceye yönelik müdahaleci düşüncelerle boğuşuyorum ve üretken bir şey yapmak için kendimi motive edemiyorum."
"Motivasyon eksikliğim, kendimi yetersiz hissetmem ve düşüncelerimle olan mücadelem beni tamamen felç ediyor."
"Düşüncelerim beni sürekli ele geçiriyor, kendimi değersiz hissediyorum ve herhangi bir işe başlamak için kendime gücümü toplamam çok zor."
"Üretken olmak istiyorum ama kendime olan güvensizliğim ve sürekli negatif düşünceler beni engelliyor, bir türlü harekete geçemiyorum."
"Zihnimde sürekli bir yetersizlik duygusu ve negatif düşüncelerle boğuşuyorum, bu da beni her şeyi bırakmaya ve hiçbir şey yapmamaya itiyor."
"Kendimi motive edemiyorum çünkü sürekli olarak kendimi yetersiz buluyor ve düşüncelerim beni sürekli ele geçiriyor, hiçbir şey başaramayacağım hissine kapılıyorum."
"Sıfır arkadaşım olduğunu ve ailemin yardım etmediğini hissediyorum... Çok üzgün hissettim çünkü şimdi hiçbir planım yok... Son 3 gündür uykuda ve uykuda yataktayım. Hemşireyim, bu yüzden berbat olduğumu biliyorum ama sadece çok yorgun ve zayıf hissediyorum. 3 gün içinde hiçbir şey yemedim ya da gerçekten içmedim ama yapacak enerjiyi bulamıyorum."
"Tek başıma hissediyorum kendimi, ailemde bana destek olmuyor ve bu durum beni çok kötü hissettirdi."
"Hiçbir planım yok ve bunun nedeni yalnız hissetmem, ailem bana destek olmuyor ve bu durum beni üzüyor."
"Yatağımda kalıyorum ve uyuyorum çünkü ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, kimseye anlatamıyorum ve ailemde beni desteklemiyor."
"Son 3 gündür kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, yalnızım, ailem destek olmuyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Yorgunum, zayıfım ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum. Ailem beni desteklemiyor, yalnız hissediyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Hala kendi mücadelelerim var, ama şimdi nişanlım onları yönlendirmeme yardım ediyor."
"Artık hayatımda zorluklar olsa da, nişanlımın desteğiyle daha iyi başa çıkabiliyorum."
"Biraz zorluğum olsa da, nişanlımın bana yardımcı olması hayatımı kolaylaştırıyor."
"İlerleme kaydetmekle birlikte, nişanlım bana yol göstererek daha iyi bir yol almama yardımcı oluyor."
"Zorluklarla yüzleşmek benim için hala kolay değil, ama nişanlımın yardımıyla bunları daha iyi yönetebiliyorum."
"Hayatın zorluklarıyla başa çıkmak kolay değil, ancak nişanlımın bana olan desteği beni motive ediyor."
"""Belki şimdi semptomsuz olacağım"" gibi olurdum ve sonra hayır, olmazdım. Aslında bir ay boyunca tam bir ağlama krizi geçirdim çünkü ben - neden en... minuscule sonuçları için bu kadar çok çalışıyorum? Şeker yemiyorum, bu yüzden sevişebiliyorum, ne? Biraz daha az ginormous ağrılı bir süre mi yoksa 200km'de bir araba sürme arzusunun sadece% 5'ine mi ulaşıyorum?"
"Gerçekten inanılmaz bir şekilde ağrıdan kurtulup normale dönebileceğimi ummuştum, ama sonra kendimi çaresiz bir şekilde ağlarken buldum, çünkü tüm bu çabaların anlamı neydi?"
"Bu kadar çok çaba sarf ediyorum, ama sonuçlar çok küçük, bu nasıl mümkün olabilir? Şekersiz yaşamam, sadece daha iyi hissetmem gerekiyor, ama ne kadar daha dayanabilirim?"
"Sanki tüm bu çabaların hiçbir anlamı yok gibi hissediyorum, sürekli acı içindeyim, ve bunun neden olduğunu bile anlamıyorum. Sadece biraz daha az ağrı hissetmek ve belki de 200 km'de bir araba kullanabilmek için bu kadar mücadele ediyor muyum?"
Tüm bu çabaya rağmen sonuçlar çok küçük. Ağrının biraz daha az olması için bu kadar çaba sarf etmeye değer mi? Ya da sadece biraz daha iyi hissetmek ve belki 200 km'de bir araba kullanabilmek için?
"Kendimi biraz daha iyi hissetmemi sağlamak için bu kadar çok çaba harcıyorum, ama sonuçlar çok küçük. Şekersiz yaşamam ve daha az ağrı hissetmem gerekiyor, ama bu sürekli acı içinde yaşamaya değer mi?"
"Artık hayatta olmak istemiyordum. O zaman çok uyuşuk hissettim - açıklayamadığım bir his ama artık bunu yapacak gücüm yokmuş gibi hissediyorum. Acı çekmekten ve mücadele etmekten yoruldum. Çok çirkin ve yalnız hissetmekten yoruldum. Yeterli paraya sahip olmamaktan yoruldum. Geleceğim için umut yokmuş gibi hissetmekten yoruldum. Her ne kadar denersem çalışayım, her ay pastanın son derece ağır olduğu gerçeğinden bıktım, hala hayatta ilerleyemiyorum ve PM ile başa çıkamıyorum."
"Hayatın bana sunduğu mücadelelerden, her gün aynı sıkıntıları yaşamaktan yorulmuştum."
"Çabalarımın karşılığını görememek, hiçbir ilerleme kaydedememek beni yıpratmıştı."
"Başımın döndüğü, kendimi yapayalnız ve çaresiz hissettiğim o anlarda artık mücadele etmek istemiyordum."
Geleceğe dair hiçbir umudum kalmamıştı. Sanki tüm çabalarım boşunaydı.
"Bu acı, bu yalnızlık, bu çaresizlik beni yiyip bitiriyordu. Artık ayakta kalacak gücüm yokmuş gibi hissediyordum."
"Bunu sonsuza kadar kaldıramam. Ölüyorum. Bu hayatımı çok yaşanmaz hale getiriyor. Sürekli kızgın, üzgün, yorgun ya da sadece acı içinde... Aslında rahmimin bir boynu varmış ve biri onu boğuyormuş gibi hissettiriyor."
"Bu acıyı daha fazla kaldıramam, içimde bir yangın var ve beni kül edecek."
"İçimdeki bu ağırlık beni paramparça ediyor, nefes alamıyorum, her şey çok zor."
"Hayatımda sürekli bir karanlık var, mutluluktan eser yok, her şey benim için çok ağır geliyor."
"Benim için yaşamın anlamı kayboldu, bu sürekli acı beni yaşamaktan bezdirdi."
"Bu duruma daha fazla katlanamam, kendimi yorgun ve tükenmiş hissediyorum, sanki hayatımın anlamı yokmuş gibi."
"Bulunacak DEHB ilaçlarım yok. OKB'mi nasıl tedavi edeceğimi biliyorum, ancak herhangi bir pozlama yapmak için çok yorgunum ve yorgunum. Menstruasyon yaptığımda luteal fazımdan hasta gibi hissediyorum. Bu korkunç."
"OKB'mi nasıl tedavi edeceğimi biliyorum, ancak bunu yapmak için şu anda enerjim yok."
DEHB ilaçlarım bitti ve şu anda yeni bir reçete almak için zamanım yok.
Menstruasyon öncesi sendromu gerçekten beni çok kötü etkiliyor.
Luteal fazımda enerjim düşüyor ve her şey beni çok yorduğumu hissettiriyor.
"Bu dönemde her şey çok zorlaşıyor, kendimi çok yorgun ve tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Gitmeden önce ne yapmam gerektiği, bebeklerimi ne kadar çok özleyeceğim ve yemek yemeyi unutmayacağım konusunda midemde bir sinir düğümü ile burada oturmak"
"Gitmeden önce yapmam gerekenleri düşünmek, geride bıraktıklarımın beni nasıl özleyeceğini hayal etmek ve yolculuğumda kendimi nasıl besleyeceğim konusunda endişelenmek beni her zaman tedirgin eder."
"Ayrılmadan önce düşünülmesi gereken o kadar çok şey var ki, geride bıraktığım her şeyi özleyerek yolculuğum sırasında kendimi ihmal edeceğimden korkuyorum."
"Kalbim hem heyecanla hem de gerginlikle dolu, gitmeden önce ne yapacağım konusunda düşüncelerim, sevdiklerimi geride bırakmak ve kendime bakmayı unutmamak konusunda endişelerimle dolu."
"Korkularımı ve heyecanımı dengelemeye çalışırken, yola çıkmadan önce ne yapmam gerektiği, geride bıraktıklarımın beni özleyeceği ve yolculuğum sırasında kendimi unutmayacağım konusunda endişelerim var."
"Gitmeden önce birçok şeyi düşünmem gerekiyor, evimden ve sevdiklerimden uzaklaşırken kendime nasıl bakacağımı ve ne kadar özleyeceğimi düşünmek beni tedirgin ediyor."
Harika bir iki hafta geçirdim ve sonra birden yumurtladım ve işkence tekrar başladı.
Harika bir tatil geçirdim ama ne yazık ki iş hayatının stresi beni yine ele geçirdi.
İki haftalık huzurun tadını çıkardım ama iş hayatının rutinine geri dönmek zorunda kaldım.
Kısa bir mola verdim ve kendimi enerjik hissettim ama şimdi iş yoğunluğu beni yoruyor.
Tatil sonrası dinlenmiş ve motive olmuştum ama iş stresi beni tekrar yordu.
Rahat ve keyifli bir dönem geçirdim ancak günlük yaşamın zorlukları beni tekrar ele geçirdi.
"Ive çok kötü PMDD vardı ve en kötü belirtiler bazı geçiyor. sinirlilik, depresyon, stres, çalışmalar."
"Son günlerde çok kötü PMDD belirtileri yaşıyorum, özellikle sinirlilik, depresyon ve stresle boğuşuyorum, bu da işlerimi etkiledi."
"PMDD belirtilerim çok yoğun, sinirliliğin, depresyonun ve stresin beni işime odaklanamayacak kadar etkilediği zamanlar oluyor."
"Geçen günlerde PMDD'nin en kötü belirtilerini yaşıyorum, sinirlilik, depresyon ve stres beni oldukça zorluyor ve işime yansıyor."
"PMDD yüzünden sinirlilik, depresyon ve stresle mücadele ediyorum, bunlar özellikle işimi etkileyen kötü belirtiler."
"PMDD belirtileriyle mücadele ediyorum, sinirlilik, depresyon ve stres beni yıpranmış hissettiriyor ve işimi etkiliyor."
"Bugün dağ çok büyük görünüyorsa, bunun yerine tepeye tırmanın. Sabah size yumuşaklık getiriyorsa, yatakta kalmak sorun değil. Bir duş iğne gibi sokarsa ve banyo boğulmuş gibi hissediyorsa, saçınızı günlerce yıkamadıysanız, tacınızı atmayın. Endişeli, kırık bir zihin için bir dakikanızı ayırın, dünya yeniden hizalanırken dönmeyi bırakmaz."
"Bugün gökyüzü bulutlu görünüyorsa, şemsiyeni yanına almayı unutma. Yağmurdan ıslanmak seni hasta edebilir."
"Çayın sıcaklığı boğazını yakıyorsa, biraz bekleyip soğumasını bekle. Sıcak içeceklerden zevk almayı öğrenmelisin."
"Güneş çok parlak görünüyor ve gözlerini rahatsız ediyorsa, gözlüğünü tak. Göz sağlığını korumak önemlidir."
"Eğer kendine çok yorgun hissediyorsan, kendini zorlama. Dinlenmek ve uyumak en iyisidir. Günün geri kalanında daha enerjik olursun."
"İlk denemede başarısız olduysan, umudunu kaybetme. Yeniden denemeye çalış. Sabır ve azim başarının anahtarıdır."
"Ben iyi değilim, o tuvalette hazırlanırken ağladım ve bu sabah çok sinirlendim."
"Bugün kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum, her şey ters gidiyor."
"Bu sabah kötü uyandım, her şey beni sinirlendirdi."
"Moralim çok bozuk, ağlamak istiyorum."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, her şey beni üzüyor."
"Her şey çok zor, baş edemiyorum."
"DYSPHORIC, yaşamak son derece zordur ve yeterince ciddiye alınmaz."
"DYSPHORIC olmak, dünya ile uyumsuz bir şekilde yaşamak gibidir, sürekli bir çatışma halindesin."
"DYSPHORIC olmak, kalbinin içinde sürekli bir fırtına hissetmek gibidir, asla sakinleşmiyor."
"DYSPHORIC olmak, kendi bedeninle savaşmak gibidir, kendine ait olma hissini kaybetmişsindir."
"DYSPHORIC olmak, sürekli bir boşlukta dolaşmak gibidir, hiçbir yere ait hissetmiyorsun."
"DYSPHORIC olmak, insanların anlamakta zorlandığı bir sessiz çığlıktır, sıkıntın anlaşılmıyor."
"Çok kötü hissediyorum, onların saldırıya uğradığını ve çok sert bir şekilde geri çekildiğini görmek. Deneyimlerim hakkında konuşmak istememe neden oluyor, özellikle de sürekli yanlış yaptığım sağlık hizmetlerine erişmeye çalışıyorum. PMDD'den muzdaripim."
"Saldırıya uğradıklarını görmek beni çok üzdü, özellikle de geri çekildiklerinde çok acı çektiklerini düşününce."
"Kendimi onların yerine koyduğumda kendi deneyimlerim hakkında konuşmak istedim, çünkü sağlık hizmetlerinde yaşadığım zorlukları anlamak zor."
"Hangi hastalığa sahip olursanız olun, sağlık hizmetlerine erişmek zor ve bu da deneyimlerim hakkında konuşmak istememe neden oluyor."
"Bu tür haberleri duymak beni derin bir üzüntüye sürüklüyor, özellikle de sağlık hizmetlerine erişimdeki zorluklara tanık olduğumda."
"Sağlık hizmetlerine erişimde yaşadığım zorluklar ve bu acımasız saldırı, beni duygusal olarak çok yordu."

"Gerçekten endişeliyim, duygularım çok yoğun ve belimde korkunç bir ağrı var."
Tüm bunlarla tekrar tek başıma yüzleşmek zorunda kalacağım.Bu saçmalık.Keşke hayatımda bunu atlatacak biri olsaydı.
Tekrar aynı zorluklara tek başıma katlanmak zorunda kalacağım. Bu gerçekten adil değil.
Bu durumla tek başıma mücadele etmek çok yorucu. Yanımda biri olsa keşke.
Bütün bunlarla başa çıkmak için yalnız olmak çok zor. Desteğe ihtiyacım var.
Aynı hataları tekrar tekrar yapmak beni yoruyor. Birisi bana yol gösterse keşke.
Tekrar aynı döngüye girmek istemiyorum. Bunu aşmak için yardım almalıyım.
anksiyete ve sinirlilik hissi
Endişe ve huzursuzluk hissetmek beni rahatsız ediyor.
Son zamanlarda sürekli bir gerginlik ve endişe içindeyim.
Kalbim hızla çarpıyor ve sanki bir tehlike yaklaşacakmış gibi hissediyorum.
"Kendimi sürekli olarak endişeli ve huzursuz hissediyorum, bu da hayatımı zorlaştırıyor."
"Bu stres ve kaygı beni tüketiyor, nefes alamıyor gibi hissediyorum."
"14'ten beri PMDD teşhisi kondu...Ben benzer yaştaki bayanlardan tavsiye veya öneriler arıyorum...Ocella'ya aldırmadım, ancak durduktan kısa bir süre sonra libidomun üzerindeyken ne kadar etkilendiğini fark ettim. Bunu oldukça keyif alıyorum ve belki de daha yaşlı olduğum için ama her iki şekilde de tekrar kaybetmek istemiyorum."
"PMDD teşhisi konduktan sonra hormonal doğum kontrolü kullanmaya başladım ama cinsel isteğimi etkilediğini fark ettim, bu nedenle alternatifler arıyorum."
"Ocella'nın cinsel isteğimi ne kadar etkilediğini fark ettim, bu yüzden artık kullanmıyorum."
Ocella'yı kullandığımda cinsel isteğimi kaybettim ve bu da benim için gerçekten rahatsız ediciydi.
"Benzer bir deneyim yaşayan diğer kadınların tavsiyelerine ihtiyacım var, çünkü Ocella'yı kullandığımda cinsel isteğimi kaybettim."
"Ocella'nın libidom üzerindeki olumsuz etkisi beni çok üzüyor, bu yüzden başka seçenekler aramak istiyorum."
Kilometrelerce istiyorum. Umutsuz ve cesaretsiz hissediyorum. Kilometrelerce intrusive düşünceler. Ağlayan büyüler. Sadece ölmek istiyorum. Varlığım kendime bir yük.
Hayatımda hiçbir şeyin anlamı yok. Her şey boş ve anlamsız geliyor.
Bu acıdan kurtulmak için her şeyi yaparım. Sanki içinde bir kara delik var.
Uyuyamıyorum. Her gece aynı kabuslar. Benim için bir yol yok.
Yalnız hissediyorum. Hiç kimse beni anlamıyor. Kimse benim acımı anlamıyor.
Bir daha gülümseyeceğimi düşünmüyorum. Hayatımda hiçbir güzellik kalmadı.
"Ona söylemekten neden korktuğumu fark etmek, yolculuğu boyunca özerklik istediğini anlamama yardımcı oldu, aynı şekilde ben de kendi yolumun üzerinde özerklik istedim."
"Onun isteklerine karşı çıkmaktan çekindiğimi fark ettiğimde, özgürlüğe duyduğu özlemi anladım ve bu da bana kendi özgürlüğümün önemini hatırlattı."
"Korkularımın arkasındaki sebebi anlayınca onun da kendi yolunu çizmek istediğini fark ettim, tıpkı benim de kendi hayatımı kendim şekillendirmek istediğim gibi."
"Ona söylemekte tereddüt ettiğim şeyin, onun bağımsızlığını özlemesinin bir yansıması olduğunu anlayınca, kendim için de aynı şeyi istediğimi fark ettim."
"Onun kendine ait bir hayat istediğini anlamak, benim de aynı arzuyu taşıdığımı fark etmemi sağladı."
"Korkularımı yüzleşmekten kaçınmamın nedeni onun da benim gibi özgürlük istediğini anlamak oldu, bu da kendimi ifade etmem için bir yol açtı."
"Yaklaşık 6 ay öncesine kadar PMDD'yi öğrenmedim. Kötü bir alkolikti ve gurur duymadığım birkaç hata yaptım, eminim sadece içkisini körükledi. Daha son aylarda, MİA'nın PMDD'ye daha fazla THC'ye yardımcı olduğunu öğreniyorum."
"PMDD'yi daha önce hiç duymamıştım, ancak şimdi anlıyorum ki bu beni oldukça etkiliyor."
"İçki içmek hayatımı çok zorlaştırdı, ancak PMDD de işleri karmaşık hale getirdi."
"PMDD'nin semptomlarını azaltmak için alternatif yöntemler arıyorum, çünkü içki içmek uzun vadede işe yaramıyor."
Bu durumun hayatımı etkilediğini fark ettiğimden beri kendimi daha iyi anlamaya çalışıyorum.
"PMDD'yi yönetmenin daha iyi yolları olduğunu keşfetmek için araştırma yapıyorum, çünkü içki içmek sadece geçici bir çözüm."
Erkeğimin aşık olduğu ve yıllardır tanıdığı kadını kaybettiğimi hissediyorum... PMDD devralmadan önce kesinlikle aynı kişi olmadığımı biliyorum.
"Erkek arkadaşımın beni yıllardır tanıdığı, aşık olduğu kadına dönüştüğümü hissediyorum. PMDD'nin bende kontrolü ele geçirmesinden önce kesinlikle ben değildim."
"Kendimi artık tanıyamaz hale geldim, erkek arkadaşım aşık olduğu kadına dönmeye başladım. PMDD'nin benim üzerimdeki etkisi her geçen gün artıyor."
"Erkek arkadaşımın beni tanıdığı, aşık olduğu kişi ben değilim. PMDD'nin etkisiyle ben bambaşka bir insan haline geldim."
"Erkek arkadaşım beni, gerçek benliğimi değil de PMDD'nin etkisiyle şekillenmiş bir yansımayı seviyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu beden benimdi, bu ruh benimdi, ama PMDD'nin etkisiyle artık gerçek benliği tanımıyor gibiyim. Erkek arkadaşım beni kaybediyor olabilir."
Ben de cehennem haftasındayım.
Bu hafta benim için de tam bir felaket.
Benim de haftalarım berbat geçiyor.
Bu hafta her şey ters gitti benim için de.
Haftalarım da sizininki gibi kötü geçiyor.
Ben de bu hafta çok zorlu şeylerden geçiyorum.
Kendimi çok yalnız hissettim!!!
İçimi bir yalnızlık duygusu kapladı.
Etrafımda kimse yokmuş gibi hissettim.
Kimseyle konuşacak kimse yoktu.
Sanki tüm dünya beni terk etmiş gibi hissettim.
Yalnızlığın pençesinde kıvranıyordum.
Deneme ve yanılma süresi aldı
Bir şeyleri deneyerek ve hatalardan öğrenerek zaman geçirdim.
Uzun zaman aldı ama sonunda başardım.
Bu sonuca varmak için çokça deneme yapmam gerekti.
Deneme yanılma yoluyla öğrendim.
Çok şey denedim ve sonunda doğru olanı buldum.
Bir PMDD hastası için Prozac hemen hemen çalışır ve 15 günlük cehennem penceresinde alınabilir ve gerektiği gibi ayarlanabilir. Bence bu harika ve PMDD'nin gerçekte ne kadar benzersiz olduğunu inanılmaz.
"PMDD için Prozac'ın işe yaradığını görmek beni çok sevindirdi, özellikle de bu kadar sık ​​oluşan rahatsız edici semptomlar için bir çözüm olduğuna göre."

Birkaç farklı ilacı denedikten sonra sonunda Prozac'a karar verdik.
Prozac'a ulaşmak için birkaç ilaç denedik.
Uzun bir deneme yanılma sürecinden sonra Prozac'ta karar kıldık.

Eğer luteal fazımın dışına çıkarmaya çalışırsam bu beni korkunç hissettiriyor ve serotonin zehirlenmesi geçiriyorum gibi.

"Zoloft'un PMDD'me Lexapro'dan daha iyi geleceğini umuyorum, çünkü Lexapro hiç etkili olmadı."
"Lexapro PMDD'ye karşı işe yaramadığı için, şimdi Zoloft'a geçiş yapıyorum."
"PMDD semptomlarımı hafifletmek için Lexapro'dan Zoloft'a geçiyorum, Lexapro hiç fayda sağlamadı."
"Lexapro hiç işe yaramadığı için Zoloft'a geçiyorum, umarım PMDD'me yardımcı olur."
"Lexapro etkisiz kaldığı için, şimdi Zoloft'u denemeye karar verdim, belki PMDD'me yardımcı olur."
Welbutrin bana panik ataklar verdi. Prozac ve Venlafaxine alıyorum ve combo benim için oldukça iyi çalışıyor.
"Welbutrin'in beni panik ataklara sürüklemesi beni şaşırttı, Prozac ve Venlafaxine kombinasyonu ise oldukça iyi çalışıyor."
"Welbutrin'den hiç beklemediğim yan etkiyle karşılaştım, panik ataklar yaşadım. Neyse ki Prozac ve Venlafaxine birlikte kullanımı gayet iyi sonuç veriyor."

"Ne zaman bir şeyleri kırmak, bir şeyleri atmak, kendime zarar vermek gibi bir hayal kırıklığı yaşasam, bu bölümlere girdiğimde aynaya bile baktım ve yüzüm aynı görünmüyor. Gözlerim doğru görünmüyor.... Boynuma bir eşarp taktım ve bu bölümler sırasında kendimi boğmaya çalıştım. Makas ve bıçakları tuttum ve onlarla kendimi incitmeye çalıştım."
"Hayatımın en karanlık anlarında kendimi tamamen yabancı hissettim, sanki aynada bakan bana ben değilmişim gibi."
"Bu krizlerde kendimi kontrol edemediğim, adeta vücudumun kendiliğinden hareket ettiği hissine kapıldım."
"Kendimi bu kadar aciz ve çaresiz hissettiğimde, sanki kendimi yok etmeye çalışıyordum."
"Sanki vücudumun içinde başkalaşım geçirmiş, kendime yabancılaşmış gibiydim."
"Duygularımın beni ele geçirdiğini, tamamen kontrolüm dışına çıktığını hissettim."
Bir süredir PMDD ile acı çekiyorum. Son birkaç yıl çok zor geçti... PMDD teşhisi kondu. Geçen yıl tamamen bitkinliğe doğru kademeli bir eğim oldu.
"PMDD benim için gerçekten zor bir deneyim oldu, özellikle son birkaç yıldır."
"PMDD teşhisi konulmadan önce, ne olduğunu anlamıyordum ve neden bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi merak ediyordum."

"PMDD ile başa çıkmak çok zor, bazı günler kendimi tamamen tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"PMDD'nin hayatımı ne kadar etkilediğini görmek beni üzüyor, günlük yaşamımı etkiliyor."
"Dürüstçe çok daha depresif hissediyorum, sabahları umutsuz hissediyorum ve işe kadar ağlamaya devam ediyorum. Bütün gün sinirli ve olumsuz hissediyorum. Her şey beni deli ediyor, kendim bile. Hiçbir şey bana neşe getirmiyor."

"Çocuklarla uğraşmaktan ve evde her şeyi yapmaktan gerçekten bunaldım, kendimi hiç dinlenemiyorum."
"Her şey beni aştı, kendimi hiç dinlenemiyorum, her şey kontrolümden çıktı."
"Sürekli koşturmacadan ve her şeye yetişmeye çalışmaktan yoruldum, artık kendime biraz zaman ayırmam gerekiyor."
Hastaları tam ve tam olarak tedavi edemediğim için çok fazla iş kaçırdım.
"Hastalara gereken ilgiyi gösteremiyorum, sürekli olarak işimin yoğunluğu sebebiyle onlara gereken zamanı ayıramıyorum."
"İş yükümün fazla olması sebebiyle, hastalarıma yeterince zaman ayıramıyor ve onların ihtiyaçlarını tam olarak karşılayamıyorum."

"Genellikle menstrüasyon başlamadan 10-12 gün önce kalınlaştığımda, psikiyatristime göre iki kat daha güçlü olmak için sertralin dozuyla tırmandım. CBT terapi seanslarına gidiyorum. Her döngüde daha az yoğunluğa ve bölüm şiddetine sahibim. Ama yine de bana çarpıyor."
"Her ay aynı şey tekrarlıyor, menstrüasyon başlamadan 10-12 gün önceki o yoğunluk, sanki kendimle savaş halindeyim."
"Sertralin dozumu yükselttiğimde biraz rahatlıyorum, ama yine de o dönemde bir savaş veriyorum."

"Ben ve kız kardeşlerim genetik olarak hormonal dengesizliğe yatkınız. Hormonlar ve kuşak travması üzerine suçlayın! Evde büyürken başa çıkma mekanizması olarak geliştirdiğimi düşündüğüm kötü bir mizah anlayışım var. Sakin olun, nefes almaya devam edin, terapi ve SSRI'lara devam edin,"
"Ailece biraz çılgın olduğumuzu söyleyebilirim, hormonlar, genetik ve çocukluk travması... Her şeyi suçlayın!"
"Genetik bir hormon dengesizliği mi var, yoksa bu sadece bir aile şakası mı? Bilemiyorum, ama komik olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Büyük bir aileyiz ve hepimizin biraz tuhaf olduğunu söylemek zorundayım. Sanırım bu ailemizde böyle oluyor, genetik mi yoksa travma mı bilmiyorum ama hepimizi bir araya getiriyor."
"Ailede genetik olarak biraz delilik var, bu kadarını söyleyebilirim. Hormonlar, aile tarihi, hepimiz bundan payımızı alıyoruz."
"İnsanlar bana neden bu kadar sinirli olduğumu soruyor. Ben de onlara sadece 'genetik' diyorum ve bir de gülüyorum. Çünkü evet, bu ailede biraz hormon sorunu var."
"Öğrenme engelliliğim, tüm Ritalin ve SSRI'lara rağmen sağlık hizmeti kursu talep ederken beni etkiliyor. Benim evrenimde, zaman, stres kaygısını ve kurs çalışmasını yönetmek anlamına gelir (özlü zaman yönetimi becerileri). Kırk yaşında, spektrum bozukluğu ile geçen 20 yılı yaşamak, sahip olduğu etiket ne olursa olsun, kalıplarımı tanımakta iyiyimdir, ancak sınıf ortamı söz konusu olduğunda, eğitimciler tarafından her zaman daha fazla anlayış ve özen yaklaşımına ihtiyacım var."
"Öğrenme güçlüğü, zamanımı yönetip ders çalışmamı etkiliyor ve bu durum, Ritalin ve SSRI'lere rağmen, sağlık hizmetleri kursu alma isteğimi zorlaştırıyor."

"Benim evrenim, stresi yönetmek, zamanı iyi kullanmak ve ders çalışmak anlamına geliyor; öğrenme engelliliğim, bu dengeyi kurmayı zorlaştırıyor."
"Sınıfta, öğrenme engelliliğim nedeniyle, eğitimcilerin farkındalığı ve desteği her zamankinden daha önemli. Benim zaman yönetimi becerilerim de bu süreci kolaylaştırmaya yardımcı oluyor."
"20 yıllık bir mücadeleye rağmen, spektrum bozukluğu hala sınıf ortamında zorluklar çıkarıyor; ancak zamanımı iyi yönetmek ve stresi kontrol altında tutmak için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalışıyorum."
PMDD'm her zaman şiddetli ve acı veren öfke atakları ve panik atakları ile geldi... Ama öfke veya panik atak belirtisi yoktu... Ailem veya arkadaşlarım belki de incitici bir şey söyleyeceklerdi ve tipik tepkim gerçekten kötü bir tepkiydi ama bu sefer sakinliğimi koruyabildim ve net bir şekilde düşünebildim...
"PMDD'nin beni ele geçirdiği zamanlar, beni bir öfke ve panik dalgası içine çekiyordu, fakat bu sefer hiçbiri gelmedi."
"Her zaman PMDD'nin şiddetli duygusal dalgalanmalarıyla mücadele ettim, ama bu sefer inanılmaz bir şekilde sakin ve net kalmayı başardım."

"PMDD'nin etkisiyle başa çıkmak, sakinliğimi korumak yerine öfke ve paniğe kapılmak anlamına geliyordu, ancak bu sefer sanki bir sihirle sakinleştim."
"Ailemin veya arkadaşlarımın sözleri beni genellikle çok kötü tepkiler vermeye zorluyordu, ama bu sefer tamamen farklıydım, sakin ve net düşünüyordum."
ezici duygusal semptomlar (ayrıca bazı fiziksel / psikosomatik semptomlar)

"Duygularım kontrol edilemez durumda, aynı zamanda bedenimde de bazı garip hisler var."
"Duygusal olarak çöküyorum, sanki bedenim de bu duyguya ayak uyduruyormuş gibi."
"Hem duygusal hem de fiziksel olarak kötü hissediyorum, sanki bedenim duygularımı yansıtıyor gibi."
Sürekli bir kriz durumundayım ve her şeyi yaparım kendimi merdivenlerden aşağı atarım.
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ve bir şey yapmazsam kendimi daha da kötü hissedeceğim, belki de kontrolümü kaybedip çılgınlık yapacağım."
"Bu kadar kötü hissettiğimde aklımı kaybedip her şeyi yaparım, kendimi bile tehlikeye atarım."
"Tam bir kaos içindeyim, sanki bir uçurumun kenarındayım ve kendimi aşağı atmak üzereyim."
"Durum o kadar vahim ki, kendimi kontrol etmek için elimden gelen her şeyi yapıyorum ama sonunda kendimi kaybetmekten korkuyorum."
"Bu sıkıntılı dönemde kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum, her şey çok kötü, her şeyi yapmaya hazırım, kendimi bile tehlikeye atarım."

"2 haftadır regl dönemindeyim, acı çekiyorum, sonu belli değil... Kilometrelerce istediğim kadar kötüleşen PMDD belirtilerinden bahsetmiyorum bile."
"Regl dönemiyle birlikte gelen ağrılar dayanılmaz hale geldi, ne zaman biteceği de belli değil. Üstelik PMDD belirtilerim de giderek kötüleşiyor, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Bu regl dönemi gerçekten çok zorlu geçiyor, ağrılarım hiç dinmiyor. PMDD belirtilerim de cabası, kendimi bitkin ve yorgun hissediyorum."
"Ağrılar yüzünden bu regl dönemi tam bir kabus, ne zaman sona ereceğini bilmiyorum. PMDD belirtilerim de her geçen gün daha da kötüleşiyor."

"Bu regl döneminde hem ağrılarım hem de PMDD belirtilerim çok yoğun, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, ne zaman biteceğini bilmiyorum."
Aylardır böyle hissetmedim ve PMDD zihinsel erimemin üstesinden gelmeyi umuyordum.
"Uzun zamandır kendimi bu kadar kötü hissetmiyordum, umarım PMDD'nin zihinsel tükenişini atlatabilirim."
"Aylardır böyle hissetmiyorum, umarım PMDD'nin zihinsel yorgunluğunu yenebilirim."
"Bu hissi aylardır yaşamadım, umarım PMDD'nin zihnimi yiyip bitirdiği bu durumu aşabilirim."
"Bir süredir kendimi bu kadar kötü hissetmiyordum, umarım PMDD'nin zihinsel yıpranmasını atlatabilirim."
"Aylardır böyle bir halde değildim, umarım PMDD'nin zihinsel tükenişinin üstesinden gelebilirim."
"PMDD'den muzdaripim ve bana biraz rahatlama getirmek için tıbbi doğrulama buldum. PMDD'yi yaşamayanların çoğunun bozukluğu meşrulaştıramadığı veya ""sadece gerçekten kötü pm"" olarak aktaramadığı bir sır değil. Bu gerçek, tıbbi bir rahatsızlıktır ve bu gerçeği bir beyin taraması hakkında paylaşmak istedim çünkü sahteci olmadığımız, drama kraliçesi olmadığımız veya ilgi arayanlar değiliz."
"PMDD'nin ne kadar zorlu olabileceğini anlatmak için, insanların bunu deneyimlemediği sürece gerçekten anlayamazlar."
"PMDD'nin benim yaşamımı nasıl etkilediğini anlatmak için mücadele ediyorum, çünkü çoğu insan bunun sadece PMS'nin şiddetli bir formu olduğunu düşünüyor."
"Çoğu kişi, PMDD'den muzdarip olduğumu söylediğimde bana inanmıyor, bu yüzden kendimi doğrulamak ve bir beyin taraması hakkında konuşmak için motive oldum."
PMDD hakkında farkındalık yaratmak için bu gerçeği paylaşıyorum çünkü çoğu kişi bunun ciddi bir tıbbi durum olduğunu anlamıyor.

Daha sonra akıl hastalığını ona karşı silahlandırmış olan ev işlerine yardım isteyen bir ortak gibi hissediyorum.
"Ev işlerine yardım etmeyi reddedip, beni zor durumda bırakarak sanki ruh sağlığımı benden karşı kullanıyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Benimle paylaştığı sorumlulukları yerine getirmek yerine, sürekli olarak yardım isteyerek sanki akıl sağlığımı kendi çıkarları için kullanıyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Sanki akıl sağlığımı kendi isteklerini elde etmek için bir araç gibi kullanarak, sürekli olarak ev işlerinde bana yük bindiriyor."
"Yaptığı eylemlerle beni daha da zor durumda bırakıyor, sanki akıl sağlığımı kendi çıkarları için manipüle ediyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Sanki ruh sağlığımı bir koz olarak kullanarak, ev işlerinde sürekli olarak benden yardım talep ederek beni kullanıyor gibi hissediyorum."
"Ölmeden üç ay öncesine kadar 11 ila 15 yıl boyunca acı çektiğini bilmiyordu. 33 yaşındaydı, iki küçük çocuk annesi, bebeklerini doğurmadan önce torasik yoğun bakım hemşiresiydi ve her şey onun için gidiyordu ve PMDD yavaş yavaş her şeyi ondan çaldı."
"Yaşadığı zorluklardan habersiz, hayatının son üç ayına kadar her şey yolunda gibiydi."
İki küçük çocuğu ve işini çok seviyordu ama hayatındaki mutluluk yavaşça kayboluyordu.
"Tüm yaşananlara rağmen, o son üç aya kadar hayatının genel olarak iyi olduğunu düşünüyordu."
Her şey yolunda giderken hayatına giren bu hastalık onun için çok acı vericiydi.
"33 yaşında, iki çocuk annesi ve başarılı bir hemşireyken, hayatının son üç ayına kadar ne kadar mutsuz olduğunu fark edemedi."
Yıllardır pmdd ile mücadele ediyorum... kalp krizi gibi hissettiren bir saat süren anksiyete artışı vardı.
"Yıllardır baş etmeye çalıştığım pmdd'nin etkileri, bazen yoğun ve korkutucu olabiliyor, özellikle bu anksiyete atakları sırasında kendimi kalp krizi geçiriyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Son zamanlarda pmdd'nin etkisiyle yaşadığım yoğun anksiyete atakları beni çok yordu, sanki vücudum bu atağın yoğunluğuna dayanamıyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Anksiyete artışları pmdd'nin en zorlayıcı belirtilerinden biri, her seferinde sanki kalp krizi geçirecekmiş gibi hissetmek beni gerçekten korkutuyor."

"Geçen günlerde yaşadığım yoğun anksiyete atağı, sanki vücudum içinde bir fırtına kopuyormuş gibi hissetmeme neden oldu."
Göğsümde tam anlamıyla ağır bir his var ve sadece kesinlikle bir şey yapmak istemiyorum.
"Yorgun hissediyorum, hiç bir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Yükümün çok ağır olduğunu hissediyorum, bugün sadece istirahat etmek istiyorum."
"Büyük bir ağırlık taşıyormuş gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak için enerjim yok."
"İçimde bir boşluk var, hiçbir şeyle ilgilenmek istemiyorum."
"Bugün hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, tüm enerjimi kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Kötü niyetli anne, kadınlar tarafından zorbalık, kadın arkadaşlar tarafından sahte ve ihanet, travma"
"Kadınların yaşadığı zorbalık, ihanet ve sahtekarlık, travmaya yol açan kötü niyetli bir kadının davranışlarının bir sonucu olabilir."

"Kötü niyetli bir kadının kötü niyetli eylemleri, başkalarında travma ve duygusal acıya yol açabilir, özellikle de yakın arkadaşları tarafından yapılan zorbalık ve ihanet durumlarında."
Acıkmayı tam anlamıyla bırakamıyorum. Zaten iki gündür özlemeye teslim oldum. İlk gün kendimi hasta ettim.
"Bu özlemi atlatabileceğimi düşünmüyorum, iki gündür kendimi ona teslim etmiş gibiyim."
"Bu duyguyu kontrol edemiyorum, iki gündür özlemin pençesindeyim."
"İstediğim kadar dirensem de özlem duygusunu bastıramıyorum, iki gündür bu hisse kapılmış durumdayım."
Acıkmayı yenmek için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapıyorum ama iki gündür kendimi bu duygunun etkisi altında hissediyorum.
"İsteksizliğimi yenmek çok zor, iki gündür özlemimin beni ele geçirmesine izin verdim."
"Her zaman kızgınım. Kocamı bir noktada ağlatacağımdan eminim çünkü çok sinsiydim. Bunun 34 haftasını daha düşündüğümde, gerçekten kötü bir endişe duyuyorum. Her gece gecenin bir yarısı endişeyle uyanıyorum."
Hamileliğimin bu son aşamalarında sinirlilikten her şeyden öfkeleniyorum.
"Kocamın sürekli bana sabır göstermesine rağmen, bazen sinirlenip ona bağırdığım oluyor."
Gece geç saatlerde uyuyamıyorum çünkü kocamı ne zaman kızdıracağımı düşünüyorum.
34 hafta daha bu öfkeyle yaşamam gerektiğini düşünmek beni gerçekten korkutuyor.
"Bütün bu öfkenin nedenini anlamaya çalışıyorum, ama bu bana hiç de yardımcı olmuyor."
Idk adam PMDD'm ne kadar kötüleşirse o kadar yaşlanıyorum gibi görünüyor. Eskiden zihinsel olarak da şimdi fiziksel olarak da öyle.
"Benim PMDD'm, beni hem zihinsel hem de fiziksel olarak yıpratıyor gibi görünüyor. Eskiden daha çok zihnimde hissediyordum, şimdi vücudumda da hissediyorum."
"Yaşlandıkça PMDD'm daha kötüye gidiyor gibi hissediyorum. Artık sadece zihnimde değil, vücudumda da hissediyorum."
"Bu PMDD benim için ne kadar zorlaştığını anlatamıyorum. Eskiden sadece zihinsel olarak hissediyordum, şimdi her yerim ağrıyor."
Geçen her gün PMDD'm daha da kötüleşiyor. Sanki her geçen gün daha da çaresiz oluyorum.
"PMDD'min bu kadar kötüleşmesinden gerçekten endişeleniyorum. Bir zamanlar sadece zihinsel bir şeydi, şimdi tüm vücudumu etkiliyor."
"Doktorların birbirleriyle irtibat kurmaları, fırçalamaları ve hasta için uyumlu bir ekip olmamaları çok tembel ve zararlıdır."
"Doktorlar arasında iletişim ve iş birliği eksikliği, hastalar için olumsuz sonuçlar doğurur."
"Eğer doktorlar birbirleriyle iyi iletişim kurmazlarsa, hasta bakımı olumsuz etkilenir."
Doktorların birbirleriyle uyumlu çalışmaları hasta sağlığı için çok önemlidir.
"Doktorlar arasındaki iletişimsizlik, hastalara zarar verebilecek hatalara yol açabilir."
"Doktorların birbirleriyle iş birliği yapmamaları, hastaların tedavi sürecini uzatabilir."
"Bundan o kadar nefret ediyorum ki. Temel olarak ""Ben yumurtalık hormonlarıyla uğraşmıyorum, git bir jinekoloğa görün"" diyorlar... bu fiziksel bir şey mi, yoksa Tanrı akıl sağlığını mı yasaklıyor?"
"Bu gerçekten sinir bozucu. Sanki, 'Benimle uğraşma, başka birine git' diyorlar."
Bu durumu gerçekten anlamıyorum. Sanki bir çözüm sunmak yerine beni başkasına yönlendiriyorlar.
"Böyle tepki vermek beni çok üzdü. Sanki beni dinlemiyor, sadece savuşturuyorlar."
Bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum. Sanki kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum.
Bu tavrı hiç hoş bulmadım. Sanki beni ciddiye almıyorlar.
"Acı çekiyorum, sadece daha iyi olmak istiyorum."
"Her şey çok zor, sadece her şeyi daha iyi hale getirmek istiyorum."
"Beni anlamakta zorlanıyorsun, sadece senden daha iyi bir ilişki istiyorum."
"Şu an çok kötü hissediyorum, sadece bir daha bu acıyı yaşamak istemiyorum."
"Bu durumdayken kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum, sadece kendimi daha iyi hissetmek istiyorum."
"Seninle aramızda sorunlar var, sadece ikimizi de mutlu edecek bir çözüm istiyorum."
Beni gaza getiriyorlarmış gibi hissediyorum. Bana verebilecekleri def testleri olduğunu ve tembel ya da bilgisiz olduklarını hissediyorum.
"Onlar beni test etmek istediklerini düşünüyor, beni aptal yerine koyuyorlar."
"Bana sürekli zorluk çıkarıyorlar, bilgisiz olduğumu düşünerek."
"Sanki ben aptalmışım gibi davranıyorlar, bana sürekli kanıtlamam gereken şeyler sunuyorlar."
"Beni kışkırtmaya çalışıyorlar, beni yetersiz hissettirmek için zorluyorlar."
"Bilgimi sorgulamaya çalışıyorlar, ben aptal gibi davranıp onlara kanıtlamamı istiyorlar."
O kadar korkmuştum ki PMDD'nin ne olduğunu açıklamaya çalışmak zorunda kalacaktım... Sonunda duyduğumu ve anladığımı hissettim.
"Benimle konuşmak zorunda kalacağına,  açıklamayı bırakıp sustu."
Korkumdan onun hissettiklerimi anlayabileceği bir şekilde konuşamadım. 
"Bana anlayışla yaklaşması beni rahatlattı,  sanki yüküm hafifledi."
Sözcüklerin anlamından öte hissettiğim her şeyi anladığını bilmek rahatlatıcıydı.
O an anlaşıldığımı hissetmek  sanki o korkunç yükten kurtulmuş gibiydim.
"Onlara, sorunlarımızı dinlemeye ve düşünmeye teşvik edildiklerini düşünerek gidiyoruz, ama onlar kesinlikle biraz bile değil."
"Onlara, kendimizi ifade edebileceğimizi düşünerek gidiyoruz, ama gerçekte kimsenin umurunda değil."
"Biz onlara, sorunlarımızı anlayacaklarını umarak gidiyoruz, ancak onlar bu konuda oldukça duyarsızlar."
"Sorunlarımızı onlara anlatmaya çalışıyoruz, ancak onların bizim sorunlarımızla ilgilenmediği oldukça açık."
"Onları sorunlarımızla yüzleştirmeyi umuyorduk, ancak onlar her şeyi görmezden gelmeye kararlı."
"Umudumuz onların dinleyecekleri ve anlayacaklarıydı, ancak gerçek şu ki, onlar sadece dinlemeyi reddediyorlar."
Bu çok sinir bozucu.Son terapist bana bunun üzerinde çalıştığımı takip etmem için bir sürü kaynak verdi.
Bu durumun sürekli olarak devam etmesi beni gerçekten yoruyor.
Bir çözüm bulmak için sürekli olarak çabalamak beni yıpratıyor.
Bu sorunu çözmek için ne kadar çok uğraşırsam o kadar çok yeni sorunla karşılaşıyorum.
Yeni bir şey denemekten yoruldum.
Bu durumun nasıl çözülebileceğini bilmiyorum ve bu beni çok bunaltıyor.
Kaçınılmaz çöküntü gelmeden önce bıraktığım belirli yönlendirmeleri vermesine izin verilmediğini söyler söylemez.
"Bıraktığım talimatları vermesini engelledikleri, kaçınılmaz çöküşten önce uyarılmadığımı anlayınca fark ettim."
"Beni bilgilendirmesi, kaçınılmaz çöküşün arifesinde, verdiğim özel talimatlara uymalarına izin verilmediğini belirttiğinde hissettim."
"Aniden, çöküşün kaçınılmazlığı üzerine, beni önceden bilgilendirmediğini, çünkü özel talimatlarımın uygulanmasına izin verilmediğini söyledi."
"Olayların kaçınılmaz seyrine rağmen, beni bilgilendirmekten kaçınmışlardı, verdiğim kesin yönlendirmeleri takip etmeleri yasaktı."
"Kaçınılmaz çöküşün öncesinde, verdiğim kesin talimatların uygulanmasının yasaklandığı bildirildi, bu nedenle uyarılmadım."

"Çok mutsuzdum, bu yüzden ağladım."
"Çok üzüntülüydüm, bu yüzden ağladım."
Bir doktor bulmaya ve HRT'yi kendim başlatmaya çalışıyorum.

"Bir yıl boyunca, vücudumda neler olduğunu dikkatle takip ediyordum. Hatta jinekolog, menstruasyon döngümün hangi gününde olduğuma bakarak vücudumun hangi hormona tepki verdiğini bile anlayabiliyordu."

"Bir endokrinolog gördüm ve en büyük zaman ve para kaybıydı. Herhangi bir şeyi dışlamak güzeldi, ancak hormon testleriniz normale dönerse"
"Endokrinolojiye gitmek büyük bir zaman ve para kaybı olduğunu düşünüyorum, test sonuçlarım normal döndüğü için hiçbir şey yapmama gerek yok."
"Bir endokrinoloğa gittim ve hiçbir şey bulamadılar, ama yine de bunun için çok para ödedim."
"Endokrinoloğa gittim ama bir sonuç alamadım, en azından hiçbir şeye gerek kalmaması iyi oldu."
"Endokrinoloğa gitmek tamamen boşuna çıktı,  test sonuçlarım normal çıktı."

Tam anlamıyla jinekologum tarafından gıcıklandım ve psikiyatristim bana yardım edebilecek tek kişinin bir jinekolog olduğunu söyledi.
"Beni tamamen anlıyor gibi görünmesine rağmen, jinekologum bana yardımcı olamıyor gibi görünüyor."
Jinekologum bana yardım edemediği için hayal kırıklığına uğradım ve bunun için ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.

Aptalca şeyler yapmayı düşünüyordum (yapmayacağım, söz veriyorum) ve biriyle konuşmayı ve acılarımı serbest bırakmayı düşünüyordum."
"PMS ve PMDD ile yaşadığım zorlukları kimse anlamıyor, özellikle de en yakınım olan kişi."
"Sanki bu duygusal iniş çıkışları benim kontrolüm altında gibi davranıyor, ama ben sadece bu durumu kabullenmeye çalışıyorum."
"Bu zor zamanlarda yalnız ve anlaşılmamış hissetmek çok yıpratıcı, sanki kimse benim acılarımı anlamıyor."
"Kimse bana yardımcı olmuyor, aksine eleştirilerle beni daha da kötüye götürüyorlar, kendimi savunmasız hissediyorum."
"Benimle empati kurmaları ve beni desteklemeleri yerine, sanki ben kendimi bu duruma sokuyormuşum gibi davranıyorlar."
"Dünyanın sonuymuş gibi hissediyorum ve aynı zamanda her ay yokmuşum gibi hissediyorum... Bir takım ping sesinde ayrılıyorum ve ağlıyorum... Kendi vücuduma karşı savaşıyormuşum gibi hissediyorum. Vücudumu seviyorum, dönemimin ilk iki gününü daha fazla kaldırabilmeyi seviyorum. Ovulasyon yaparken ne kadar canlı hissettiğimi hissediyorum ama lanet PM'yi kaçırmak istemiyorum!!!"
Adet dönemlerimde kendi bedenimle savaştığım hissine kapılıyorum. Dünyanın sonu gibi geliyor ve aynı zamanda yokmuşum gibi... sanki bedenimden ayrılmışım ve ağlıyormuşum gibi.
"Kendi vücudumun içinde mahsur kaldığımı hissediyorum, bir yandan dünyanın sonuymuş gibi hissediyorum, diğer yandan hiç var olmamışım gibi..."
Bir takım ping sesiyle adet dönemi acıları beni kuşatıyor ve ağlıyorum... sanki kendi bedenimle savaş halindeyim.
"Dünya son bulmuş gibi hissediyorum, sanki yokmuşum gibi... kendi bedenimle savaşıyorum, ama vücudumu seviyorum, adet döneminin ilk iki günü daha az acı olsa keşke!"
"Bu dönemde sanki bedenimden ayrılmışım, kendimden uzaklaşmışım gibi hissediyorum, sanki dünyanın sonu gelmiş gibi... ama bedenimi seviyorum, adet döneminin ilk iki gününü daha fazla kaldırabilmeyi diliyorum."
Beni kullanılmış ve kötülemiş gibi hissediyorum... ezici bir şekilde yalnızım ve bu dekolman döneminin çabucak geçmesini istiyorum çünkü çok fazla acı çekiyorum ve çok ihanete uğramış hissediyorum.
"Kendimi çaresiz ve terk edilmiş hissediyorum, bu boşluk beni tamamen yiyip bitiriyor."
"Yalnızlığın acısıyla boğuşuyorum, sanki dünyadan kopmuş gibiyim ve bu hissin bir an önce geçmesini diliyorum."
"İhanetin derin yaralarını taşıyorum, kalbim parçalanmış gibi ve bu acıdan kurtulmak için çabalıyorum."
"Kendimi değersiz ve işe yaramaz hissediyorum, bu yalnızlık beni paramparça ediyor."
"Bu acı dolu dönem bir an önce sona ersin diye yalvarıyorum, çünkü artık dayanamıyorum."
"Derinlerde derinlerde derinlerde derinlerde yaşıyorum. Kocam artık umursamıyor, her şeyi mahvettim. İyi değilim ve kimse beni umursamıyor. O kadar yalnız hissediyorum ki kimsem yok!!! Ciddi ciddi devam etmek istemiyorum. Bu korkutucu!!!"
"Hayatımın en karanlık yerindeyim, hiçbir şey yolunda değil ve artık umudum kalmadı."
"Her şey mahvoldu, artık her şeyden bıktım ve kendimi tamamen yalnız hissediyorum."
"Kendimi çaresiz ve yalnız hissediyorum, hayatta devam etmek için hiçbir sebebim yok."
"Korkunç bir yalnızlık içindeyim ve artık umudumu kaybettim, bu hayatın bana sunduğu tek şey acı."
"İçimde derin bir boşluk var ve bu boşluk giderek büyüyor, kimse beni anlamak veya yardımcı olmak için burada değil."
"Kendimi son derece duygusuz hissediyorum.... Bugün sadece zihinsel olarak berbat hissediyorum.... O kadar sert bir şekilde sızıyordum ki, tam anlamıyla bir ısı parlaması yaşıyordum.... Kendi cildimden koparmak istiyormuş gibi hissetmiyorum. Yorucu."
Bugün gerçekten kötü bir ruh halindeyim ve her şey beni sinirlendiriyor.
"Fiziksel olarak yorgun olmakla birlikte, duygusal olarak da bitkin hissediyorum."
Her şey beni bunaltıyor ve sadece yalnız kalmak istiyorum.
"Bu kadar kötü hissetmek çok zor, hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor."
"Kendimi çok hassas ve kırılgan hissediyorum, en ufak bir şey bile beni etkileyebiliyor."
"Ben Joe Dede gibi hissediyorum. Ben de DEHB ve karmaşık TSSB var. Ben bu kombo her ay en yaygın semptom yorgunluk anlamına gelir. Ben kanamadan sonra ve yumurtlamadan önce iyi çalışabilirim, bazen bir sürü işlev! Ama yumurtlamadan sonra bitkin hale gelir ve yatakta çok zaman geçiririm."
"Joe Dede'nin hissettiklerini ben de yaşıyorum, DEHB ve karmaşık TSSB'nin birleşik etkisiyle ben de benzer zorluklarla karşılaşıyorum."
"Bu kombinasyonun getirdiği yorgunluk beni gerçekten zorluyor, özellikle de ayın belirli dönemlerinde."
"Yumurtlama öncesi ve sonrasında kendimi çok farklı hissediyorum, bazen inanılmaz derecede aktif olurken bazen de bitkinliğe yenik düşüyorum."
"Her ay aynı döngü tekrarlanıyor: Yumurtlama öncesi enerjik, yumurtlamadan sonra yorgun ve yatağa bağlı."
"Joe Dede ile aynı ruh halindeyim, bedenim ve zihnim sürekli bir mücadele halinde ve bu kombinasyonun getirdiği yorgunluk beni gerçekten zorluyor."
"İçimi parçalasam bile zamanımı ve çabamı veriyorum... Aynı zamanda kendimi 'kendimle barışık' hissediyorum, ama bu çok korkutucu bir barış, tehlikeden önceki barış. Bunun nedeni, kendimi ne kadar az ararsam, o kadar fazla suistimal edilebilirim ya da genel olarak hayatım için savaşmaya çalışmaktan ve başkalarının iyiliği için savaşmaya çalışmaktan vazgeçmemdir... intihar niyetine sahip olmak, vb."
"Gerçekten kendimle yüzleşmek istiyorum, ama bunun bana ne kadar çok zarar verebileceği konusunda endişeliyim."
"Kendimi kabul etmek ve gerçek benliğimi kucaklamak istiyorum, ancak bu aynı zamanda kendimi başkalarının istismarına karşı savunmasız bırakmak gibi hissettiriyor."
"Bu huzursuz ve ürkütücü bir barış, çünkü her şeyin değişebileceğini biliyorum. Ne kadar zayıf olduğumu hissediyorum."
"Kendimi kabul etmek ve tüm kusurlarımla kucaklamak istiyorum, ama kendimi kötüye kullanıma açık hale getirmekten korkuyorum."
"Sanki kendimle savaş halindeyim. Kendimi sevmeliyim, ama aynı zamanda beni inciten insanlardan uzak durmalıyım."
"Üzüntü ve depresyona girebilirim, hırpalanmış hissedebilirim, bu beden ve zihin katlanamayacak kadar fazladır."
"Kendimi çok yorgun ve tükenmiş hissediyorum, devam etmekte zorlanıyorum."
"Bu yükü taşıyamıyorum, içimdeki ağırlık beni ezmeye başladı."
"Her şey çok fazla, bu yükün altında eziliyorum, dayanamıyorum."
Bu kadar üzüntü ve acıya daha fazla katlanabileceğimi sanmıyorum.
"Depresyonun karanlığı beni içine çekiyor, çıkış yolu bulamıyorum."
"aşırı şişkin ve kabarık. Sıkışıklık, kilo alımı, uykusuzluk ve isteklerle birlikte. Bu sefer birkaç gün üzüntü yaşadım, ancak normal 1 haftaya kıyasla daha iyi."
"Kendimi şişmiş ve yorgun hissediyorum, sıkışmış, kilo almış, uykusuz ve her şeyden bıkmış haldeyim. Bu sefer biraz üzgün hissediyorum ama normal bir haftaya göre daha iyiyim."
"Vücudum şişmiş ve şişmiş gibi hissediyor. Sıkışmışlık, kilo alımı, uykusuzluk ve her şeye karşı isteksizlik var. Bu sefer biraz üzüntü yaşadım, ancak normal 1 haftaya göre daha iyi."
"Bu hafta her zamankinden daha şişman ve yorgun hissediyorum, kendimi sıkışmış hissediyorum, kilo alıyorum, uyuyamam ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum. Biraz üzgünüm ama geçen haftadan daha iyiyim."
"Son zamanlarda şişmiş ve yorgun hissediyorum, kendimi sıkışmış hissediyorum, kilo aldım, uyuyamam ve her şeyden bıktım. Biraz üzgünüm, ancak geçen haftadan daha iyiyim."
"Kendimi şişman ve yorgun hissediyorum, tıpkı her şeyden bıkmış ve sıkışmış gibi. Kilo aldım, uyuyamam ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum. Bu sefer biraz üzüntü yaşadım ama daha iyiye gidiyorum."
"Uzuvlarımda kurşun taşıyormuş gibi hissediyorum. Daha ağır nefes alıyorum, daha yavaş yürüyorum ve kaslarım normalden daha kolay yoruluyor."
"Vücudumda sanki bir ağırlık varmış gibi hissediyorum, hareket etmek bile zorlaşıyor."
"Her adımımda bir engel varmış gibi hissediyorum, bedenim ağırlaşıyor, yoruluyorum."
"Enerjim tükenmiş gibi hissediyorum, uzuvlarımda bir yorgunluk ve ağırlık var."
"Sanki üzerime bir yük binmiş gibi hissediyorum, kaslarım ağrıyor, yürüyemiyorum."
"Hareket etmek için tüm gücümü kullanmam gerekiyor, sanki bedenimde bir ağırlık varmış gibi."
Bu kadar uzun süre hayatta kalmam bir mucize. Bu bir yardım çığlığı mı? Evet ama yine de bulunduğumuz yer burası.
"Yaşadığım her an bir şans, bir mucize gibi hissediyorum. Yardım çağrısı mı? Belki ama gerçek şu ki buradayız."
"Burada olmam, bu kadar uzun süre hayatta kalmam inanılmaz. Belki de bir çığlık, bir yardım çığlığı ama şu an buradayız işte."
"Bu noktaya gelmek inanılmaz bir şey, bir mucize. Belki de bu bir yardım çağrısı, ama şu an bulunduğumuz yer burası."
"Hayatta kalmak zor, özellikle de bu kadar uzun süredir. Bir çeşit yardım çığlığı mı? Evet, ama gerçek şu ki, şu an buradayız."
"Bu kadar uzun süre hayatta kalmak, belki de bir mucize. Bir yardım çığlığı mı? Evet, ancak burası şu an olduğumuz yer."
Çok iyi hissediyorum!! Çok fazla enerjim var ve gerçekten mutlu hissediyorum?!... Bu duygunun genellikle geçici olduğunu bilerek gerginim:(
"Şu anda harika hissediyorum, ama bu hissin ne kadar süreceğini bilmiyorum."
"Enerjim taştı, ama bu enerjinin ne kadar süreceği konusunda endişeliyim."
"Mutluyum, ama bu mutluluğun kalıcı olmayacağını düşünüyorum."
"Bu mutluluk geçici olsa bile, şu an bunu gerçekten yaşıyorum."
"Bu harika hissin bir gün biteceğini bilmek, bunu tam olarak yaşayamamamı sağlıyor."
Bu hastalık çok fazla ekstra iş ve finansal masraf ve bakım.. günlük işimin üstünde ve yabancılaşıyor çünkü çok fazla insan anlamıyor
"Bu hastalıkla uğraşmak çok yorucu, hem fiziksel hem de duygusal olarak çok fazla enerji ve zamanımı alıyor."
"Hastalığımın getirdiği ek sorumluluklar ve masraflar, günlük yaşantımı ve işlerimi önemli ölçüde etkiliyor."
"Her şeyin üstüne, hastalığımı anlamayan ve desteklemeyen insanların olması beni çok yoruyor."
"Bu hastalıkla mücadele etmek, hem benim hem de çevremdekiler için çok fazla yük ve zorluk getiriyor."
"Sıkıntılarımın farkında olmayanların varlığı, yaşadığım bu zorlu süreci daha da ağırlaştırıyor."
"21 yaşında PMDD teşhisi kondu. Döngümün tipik olarak ilk yarısında iyiyim. İkinci yarısında kötü. Bu sefer adet dönemimi geçirmeden 24 saat önce işimle ilgili aşırı strese girdim. Şimdi hiç uyumadığımda anksiyeteye bağlı rüyalara girmeden uyuyamıyorum. Bu, kontrolüm olmadan hayatımın her yönünü etkiler."
"PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini anlamakta zorlanıyorum. Bir gün harika hissediyorum, sonraki gün ise her şey kötü gidiyor."
"Doğru ilaçlarımı aldığım zaman PMDD belirtileri çok daha az şiddetli. Ancak, stresli olduğumda, her şey çok kötüleşir."
Adet dönemimden önceki hafta özellikle zorlu oluyor. Bu dönemde kaygı seviyem tavan yapıyor ve her şeyden etkileniyorum.
PMDD'nin beni fiziksel ve duygusal olarak etkilediğini fark ettim. İletişim kurmaktan çekiniyorum ve çok yorgun hissediyorum.
"Adet döneminden önce yaşadığım kaygılar, hayatımı kontrol etmekte zorlanmama neden oluyor. Bu durum beni yıpranmış ve tükenmiş hissettiriyor."
"Ortağıma milyonlarca kez pmdd'de olduğumu ve beni yalnız bırakmasını ve unutmasını söyleyebilirim. Bu gece benimle duyguları hakkında ciddi bir tartışma yapmaya çalıştı ve büyük bir kavgaya dönüşecek. Kavga etmekten ve büyük üzüntülerden bıktım.... Bazen döngüler daha iyi göründüğünde, tamam yapıyor olacağım ve konuşuyor olacağız ve unutacağız ve aniden hiçbir yerden ajitasyon yükselmeleri olacak!!!!"
Beni yalnız bırakmasını ve unutmasını defalarca söyledim ama bu gece yine aynı döngüye girdik.
"Birlikteyken sürekli kavga ediyor ve üzüntü çekiyoruz, bu döngüden bıktım."
"Onunla konuşmaya çalıştığımda her şey daha da kötüye gidiyor, aniden sinirleniyor ve her şey kontrolden çıkıyor."
Sanki birbirimizi anlamak yerine sadece kavgaya giriyoruz.
"Birlikte olduğumuz zamanlarda sürekli üzüntü yaşıyoruz, bu durumun düzelmesini ve mutlu olmayı çok istiyorum."
İlişkimi sorguluyorum ve partnerime ne kadar yakın hissettiğimi
İlişkimizin sağlamlığı konusunda endişeliyim ve duygularımı sorgulamaya başladım.
Aramızdaki bağın gücünü test ediyorum ve hissettiklerimin gerçekliğini sorguluyorum.
Partnerime olan sevgimi sorgulamaya başladım ve onunla olan yakınlığımı değerlendiriyorum.
İlişkimizi yeniden değerlendiriyorum ve partnerime olan sevgimizin gerçekliğini sorgulamaktan kendimi alamıyorum.
Partnerime olan bağlılığımı gözden geçiriyorum ve ona olan sevgimin derinliğini anlamaya çalışıyorum.
"Aniden erkekler tarafından gerçekten iğrenç oldum. Onları pornoda bile izleyemiyorum ve bir penisin görülmesi kusmak istememe neden oluyor. Kadınlar, ancak... Onlar için yoğun bir cinsel ihtiyaç hissetmiyorum, ama bu süre zarfında onlar için derin bir cazibe buluyorum."
"Erkekler beni artık gerçekten rahatsız ediyor, onlara karşı bir tiksinti duyuyorum. Hatta pornoda bile izleyemem, cinsel organ görmek beni midem bulandırıyor."
"Kadınlar için de aynı hisleri beslemiyorum, onlarla ilgili yoğun bir cinsel istek hissetmiyorum ama bir şekilde onlara karşı derin bir çekim duyuyorum."
"Cinsellik, özellikle erkeklerle ilgili düşüncesi, beni iğrendiriyor, nefret ediyorum. Kadınlar için ise bir çekim duyuyorum, ama cinsel anlamda değil."
"Erkekler beni iğrendiriyor, onlara bakamıyorum, hatta pornolarını bile izleyemiyorum. Kadınlar ise, onları çekici buluyorum ama cinsel olarak değil."
"Cinsellik beni iğrendiriyor, özellikle erkekler tarafından. Kadınlara karşı ise bir çekim duyuyorum, ama sadece fiziksel olarak."
Ayda 2-3 hafta kendimde değilim ve olduğum kişiyle ilgili her şeyden nefret ediyorum. ve bunu durdurmak için yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok. mantıksız ve çılgın hissediyorum ve sevdiğim herkese kırbaçlıyorum ve kötü davranıyorum. Kendi zihnimin arka koltuğundayım ve bunu durdurmak için güçsüzüm.
"Bu ruh hali değişimleri beni mahvediyor, kendimden nefret ediyorum ve bu durumun kontrolünü kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu hislerle başa çıkamıyorum, sanki kendi bedenimin kontrolünü kaybetmişim gibi hissediyorum."
"Çevremdekilere karşı kötü davranışlarım beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor, kendimde değilim."
"Sanki kendi zihnimin esiriymişim gibi hissediyorum, ne yapacağımı bilemiyorum."
"Bu ruh halindeki iniş çıkışlar beni tüketiyor, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum ve bundan dolayı çok üzgünüm."
Bu sabah cried bc ailem asılı ve ben gitmek için çok stresli ve bunalmış durumdayım. Ve ayrıca kafamdaki ses bana Imma'yı bırakmamı söylediğinde ikna oldum. Ayrıca mide ağrısı ile uyandım. Her şey berbat hissediyor ve bunu yarın ve ertesi gün sonsuza kadar yapmak zorunda olduğuma inanamıyorum!!
"Ailemle bir arada olmak harika olmasına rağmen, bu kadar yoğun bir programın beni bunalttığını hissediyorum."
"Her şeyi bırakıp kaçmak istiyorum, özellikle de kendi kafamdaki ses bana bu konuda haklı olduğumu söylüyor."
"Midemde ağrı hissediyorum, sanırım stres yüzünden."
"Bu haftanın sonu çok uzun geliyor, bitmesini gerçekten istiyorum."
Umarım bu hafta sonu çabuk geçer ve her şey normale döner.
Yaklaşık 2 yıldır PMDD'm var... desteğe ihtiyacım var çünkü kesinlikle kimseye anlatmıyorum.
"Yaklaşık 2 yıldır mücadele ettiğim bir şey var... ama kimse bilmiyor, destek istiyorum."
"Benimle ilgili kimse bilmediği, çok zorlandığım bir şey var... kimseye anlatamıyorum."
"Sessizce mücadele ettiğim, kimsenin bilmediği bir durum var... gerçekten desteğe ihtiyacım var."
"Uzun süredir içimde tuttuğum, kimseye anlatmadığım bir şey var... konuşabileceğim birilerini arıyorum."
"Yaklaşık 2 yıldır devam eden, kimsenin bilmediği bir sorunum var... destek almak istiyorum ama kimseye anlatamıyorum."
Otizmimi sadece birkaç yıl önce keşfettim ve maskeleme üzerinde çalışırken PMDD semptomları ortaya çıktı / daha da kötüleşti gibi görünüyor.
"Otizm tanısını henüz birkaç yıl önce aldım, bu süreçte de PMDD semptomları belirginleşti ve şiddetlendi."
"Otizm tanımıyla birlikte PMDD semptomları da ortaya çıktı, hatta kötüleştiğini hissediyorum."
"Son birkaç yıldır otizm ile mücadele ediyorum, aynı dönemde PMDD semptomları da artış gösterdi."
Otizmle ilgili farkındalığım arttıkça PMDD semptomlarının da daha belirginleştiğini fark ettim.
Otizm teşhisiyle birlikte PMDD ile ilgili sorunlar da daha yoğunlaşmaya başladı.
"Kimyasal menopozdan önce, PMDD semptomlarını zayıflattım. Başarısız sayısız başka tedavi denedim. Bazıları resmi PMDD tanımdan önce ve bazıları da sonraydı. SNRI'leri, SSRI'leri, trisiklik antidepresanları, 3 farklı doğum kontrol haplarını, 3 farklı RİD'yi, ruh hali dengeleyicileri, anti-histaminikleri, benzodiazepinleri ve çok farklı takviyeleri ve yaşam tarzı değişikliklerini denedim."
"PMDD'nin neden olduğu duygusal iniş çıkışlarla başa çıkmak için birçok farklı tedavi yolunu denedim, ancak kimyasal menopoza girmeden önce hiçbiri işe yaramadı."
"Kimyasal menopoza girmeden önce PMDD semptomlarıyla mücadele etmek için birçok ilaç ve terapi denedim, ancak bunlardan hiçbiri tam olarak işe yaramadı."
"Doğum kontrol haplarından antidepresanlara, ruh hali dengeleyicilerinden yaşam tarzı değişikliklerine kadar sayısız tedavi denedim ama PMDD semptomları kimyasal menopoza girene kadar devam etti."
"PMDD tanısı konulmadan önce ve sonrasında birçok farklı tedavi yolu denedim, ancak hepsi birer hayal kırıklığıydı, kimyasal menopoz başlayıncaya kadar."
"PMDD semptomlarıyla başa çıkmak için, kimyasal menopoza girmeden önce, ilaçlardan yaşam tarzı değişikliklerine kadar birçok farklı tedavi denedim, fakat hiçbiri kalıcı bir çözüm olmadı."
"Bunun kötü bir fikir olduğunu hissediyorum çünkü 40 mg aldıktan sonra son 2 gün içinde anksiyetem daha da kötüleşti ve öfke patlamaları yaşıyorum, kolayca tedirgin oluyorum ve kendinden nefret ettiğim için kontrolsüzce ağlıyorum ve şişmek için dürtülerim var, yine intiharı düşünüyorum."
"Bu ilaçtan sonra kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, anksiyetem çok daha kötüleşti ve her şeyden sinirleniyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum ve kendimi değersiz hissediyorum, intihar düşünceleri de aklımdan çıkmıyor."
"40 mg'lık dozdan sonra kötüleştim, sürekli öfkeliyim,  her şeye ağlıyorum ve kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum,  intihar düşünceleri de beni bırakmadı."
"Bu ilacı kullanmaya devam edemem, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sürekli sinirleniyorum, ağlıyorum ve kendimi değersiz hissediyorum, intihar düşünceleri de gitmiyor."
"Bu ilaç bana iyi gelmiyor,  anksiyetem arttı, öfke patlamaları yaşıyorum, kendimden nefret ediyorum ve intihar düşünceleri de devam ediyor."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, bu ilaç bana iyi gelmiyor,  anksiyetem çok arttı ve intihar düşünceleri de devam ediyor."
Ben pmdd. Çocuklardan önce 9 yıl boyunca bir minera vardı.
"Artık yarım ay boyunca tamamen işlevsiz değilim, son zamanlarda semptomlarımın daha şiddetli olmasıyla etkinliğinin azaldığını hissediyorum ve dozajı artırmak zorunda kalabilirim, sadece bu bozukluktan bıktım ve bunu sürdürmek için bok yapmak zorunda kaldım. İlaçları almak, luteal sırasında daha fazla uyumak / dinlenmek, döngüm etrafında bir şeyler planlamak. Ve bu bile tedavi etmiyor, sadece beni biraz işlevsel yapıyor ama hala depresyondayım."
Bu hastalıkla uğraşmaktan yoruldum. Her şeyden önce işe yarayan bir tedavi istiyorum.
"Bu ilaçlar beni biraz daha iyi hissettirse de, hala depresif hissediyorum. Bir çözüm bulmak için başka bir yol olmalı."
Bu semptomlar hayatımı mahvediyor. Normal bir yaşam sürmek istiyorum.
Artık bu kronik ağrıyla başa çıkamıyorum. Bir çözüm bulunması gerekiyor.
"Daha fazla ilaç almak istemiyorum, ama aynı zamanda bu hastalığın beni tüketmesine de izin veremem."
Adetimi her ay almıyorum ama yaptığımda bir kamyon gibi çarpıyor. [...] Testosteron almaya başlamak istediğim için böyle bir kayıp içindeyim ama bunun nasıl oynayacağından da endişeliyim?
"Her ay düzenli olarak adet görmediğim için bunu hissetmek çok garip, ama bir kere geldiğinde çok şiddetli oluyor."
"Son zamanlarda adet düzensizliği yaşıyorum ve bu beni endişelendiriyor, hele ki testosteron almaya başlamak üzereyken."
"Testosteron tedavisiyle birlikte adet döngüm nasıl değişecek bilmiyorum, bu da beni oldukça tedirgin ediyor."
"Adet kanamalarım son zamanlarda çok yoğun ve acı verici, testosteron almak bu durumun nasıl etki edeceği konusunda endişeliyim."
Testosteron almaya karar vermeden önce adet döngümdeki değişiklikleri ve etkilerini daha iyi anlamak istiyorum.
"Aslında PMDD'm olduğunu öğrendim, adet dönemimi reddetmeme ve onları atlamak için bu kadar uzun süre doğum kontrolünde kalmama şaşmamalı."
"PMDD tanısı konulması benim için bir aydınlatıcı deneyim oldu, yıllarca doğum kontrolünü kesintisiz kullanarak adet dönemlerini atlamaya çalışmamın sebebi de artık açık."
"Doğum kontrolünü bu kadar uzun süre kullanıp adet görmeyi reddetmem, şimdi anlıyorum ki PMDD'nin bir sonucuymuş."
"PMDD teşhisinden önce, adeti atlamaya çalıştığım için bu kadar uzun süre doğum kontrolünde kalmamı anlam veremiyordum."
"Doğum kontrolünü düzenli olarak kullanmam ve adet görmeyi reddetmem, PMDD'nin varlığının bir göstergesiymiş."
"PMDD'nin gerçekliğini öğrenmek, yıllarca neden doğum kontrolünü kullanarak adet dönemlerinden kaçındığımı anlamamı sağladı."
"Yorgunluk şimdiye kadarki en kötü şey, cildim hormonal akne ile korkunç, endişe korkunç."
"Bugün kendimi kötü hissediyorum, her yerim ağrıyor ve sinirlerim bozulmuş."
"Uykusuzluk, sivilceler ve endişe beni mahvediyor."
"Enerjim yok, cildim berbat ve çok huysuzum."
"Yorgunluğun üzerine bir de sivilce çıktı, bugün hiçbir şey yolunda değil."
"Kendimi çok yorgun, mutsuz ve çirkin hissediyorum."
"Beyin sisi, anksiyete, ruh hali değişimleri, uykusuzluk, şiddetli göğüs ağrısı vb. olmadan her ay sadece bir buçuk hafta alabiliyorum. Çok mücadele ediyorum! Bunu nasıl atlatacağım konusunda çok endişeliyim."
"Her ay sadece yarım ay boyunca sağlıklı hissediyorum, sonra geri kalan zamanlarda tüm bu belirtilerle boğuşuyorum."
"Sadece iki hafta boyunca iyi hissediyorum, sonra anksiyete, uykusuzluk ve göğüs ağrısı başlıyor."
"Bu düzensizlikler beni çok yordu, normal bir hayat yaşayamıyorum."
"Her ay aynı döngü tekrarlıyor, bu durumdan nasıl kurtulacağımı bilmiyorum."
Bu belirtiler yüzünden hayatımın kontrolünü kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum.
Son zamanlarda daha kalıcı tedavi seçenekleri peşinde koşarken fikrimi PMDD'm etrafında yeniden şekillendiriyorum ve kendimi kronik olarak (belki döngüsel olarak?) hasta olarak düşünmeye başlıyorum.
PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini ve hayatımı nasıl değiştirdiğini daha iyi anlamaya çalışıyorum.
"Kronik hastalıkla yaşama fikriyle daha rahatım, bu durum hayatımı sürekli etkilediğinin farkındayım."
"Kendimi PMDD ile mücadele eden biri olarak tanımlıyorum, çünkü bu durum hayatımı derinlemesine etkiliyor."
"Daha kalıcı tedavi seçenekleri bulmak için çabalıyorum, aynı zamanda PMDD'nin beni kim olduğuma dair bakış açımı nasıl değiştirdiğini kabul ediyorum."
"Benim için en önemli şey PMDD'yle nasıl başa çıkacağımı öğrenmek, çünkü bu durumla yaşamayı kabul ediyorum."
Kendimi arkadaş çevremde kimsenin anlamadığı kadar izole hissediyorum. Sert bir şekilde yargılandığımı hissediyorum ve aslında deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar... Ayrıca geçmişten veya senaryodan gelen şeyler ve bazı küçük etkileşimlerden oluşturduğum yargılar da dahil olmak üzere HER ŞEY'i düşünüyorum.
"Arkadaşlarım beni anlamıyor gibi hissediyorum, her zaman yargılandığımı düşünüyorum, deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar. Geçmişte ve şimdi yaşadıklarımla ilgili kendime sürekli sorular soruyorum."
"Kendimi arkadaşlarımın arasında çok yalnız hissediyorum. Sanki beni hep eleştiriyorlar, deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar. Geçmişten gelen şeyler ve o an yaşadıklarım beni çok etkiliyor."
"Arkadaşlarım beni anlamıyor gibi hissediyorum, hep üzerime geliyorlar. Sanki deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar, geçmişim ve şuan yaşadıklarım yüzünden.  Her şey beni çok etkiliyor."
"Kendimi sosyal çevremde çok yalnız hissediyorum, sanki hiç kimse beni anlamıyor.  Beni eleştiriyor gibi hissediyorum,  deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar. Geçmişteki olaylar ve şimdi yaşadıklarım beni çok etkiliyor."
"Arkadaşlarımla aramda büyük bir uçurum var.  Sanki hiç kimse beni anlamıyor, sürekli yargılanıyorum.  Geçmişte yaşadıklarım ve şimdi yaşadıklarım beni çok etkiliyor, deli olduğumu düşünüyorlar."
Ruh hali semptomlarımda hiç bir değişiklik fark etmedim... PMDD semptomlarımda çok az değişiklik fark ettim. Dürüstçe PMDD'mi antidepresanımla tedavi etmeyi zorlaştırdı
PMDD'nin duygusal durumumda büyük bir etkiye sahip olduğunu hissediyorum.
Antidepresanlarımın PMDD belirtilerimi hafiflettiğini hissediyorum ama hala zorlu.
"PMDD ile mücadele etmek zor, ilaçlar bile her zaman işe yaramıyor."
"PMDD'nin etkilerini yaşamak çok yıpratıcı, kendimi yetersiz hissediyorum."
Antidepresanlarımın PMDD belirtilerimi yönetmeme yardımcı olduğunu düşünüyorum ancak hala mücadele ediyorum.
"Değersiz hissediyorum. İşimi o kadar çok sevdim ki... Kendimi işe yaramaz, verimsiz ve değersiz hissediyorum... Kendimi işe yaramaz bir aptal gibi hissediyorum... Bugünlerde çok yalnız hissediyorum ve özellikle acımasız bir pmdd döngüsü semptomu-bilgesiydi... Sadece en kötü ürperti ve terler kaybettim ve gerçekten başarısız hissettim ve mide kramplarım vardı... Im paranoyak... Im sadece çok duygulandım ve bir tür disosiyatif, sadece depresif ve değersiz hissediyorum ve kendimi tehlikeye atmıyorum."
"İşime o kadar çok bağlıyım ki, kendimi değersiz hissediyorum, sürekli bir başarısızlık duygusuyla boğuşuyorum."
"Geçtiğimiz günlerde kendimi işe yaramaz ve yalnız hissediyorum, her şeyin üstesinden gelemeyeceğim gibi."
"Bu PMDD semptomları çok zorlu, kendimi tamamen tükenmiş ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Sanki hayatım kontrolümden çıktı, kendimi değersiz ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"İşimi çok sevmeme rağmen, kendimi her geçen gün daha da işe yaramaz ve yalnız hissediyorum."
"Her türlü ruh halinden, hatta iyi türden bile nefret ediyorum. En çılgın fantezim bir süreliğine tek bir istikrarlı, bütün bir insan olmak. Bu benim için cennet gibi."
"Sürekli değişen duygulara tahammül edemiyorum, hepsinden nefret ediyorum, en iyilerinden bile.  Tek bir kişiliğe sahip olma hayalini kuruyorum, bir süreliğine tek bir ruh haline sahip olmak mutluluk gibi olur."
"Duygularımın sürekli değişmesi beni yoruyor, hiçbiriyle rahat edemiyorum. Bir süreliğine normal bir insan olmak ve sadece tek bir duygu hissetmek harika olurdu."
"Her duygu bana yabancı geliyor, hatta iyi hissettiğim zamanlarda bile. Her şeyden çok istikrarlı bir ruh halinde olmak isterdim, bu benim için gerçek bir cennet olurdu."
"Hiçbir duygumda huzur bulamıyorum, sürekli bir karmaşa içindeyim. Sadece bir süreliğine dengeli, sakin bir ruh halinde olmak istiyorum."
"Tüm bu duygusal iniş çıkışlar beni tüketiyor.  Tek bir duyguya sahip olmak,  en çılgın hayalim, benim için gerçek bir özgürlük olurdu."
Ebeveynlerim bunu dikkat çekmek için uydurduğumu düşündükleri için bazı PMDD semptomlarını tetikliyorlar.
"Ebeveynlerim, PMDD semptomlarımı görmezden geldiklerini düşünüyor ve bunu dikkat çekmek için uydurduğumu sanıyorlar."
"Annem ve babam, PMDD'nin sadece dikkat çekmek için uydurduğum bir şey olduğuna inanıyor."
"Ebeveynlerim, PMDD semptomlarımın gerçek olmadığını düşünüyor ve sadece dikkat çekmek için uydurduğumu söylüyorlar."
PMDD semptomlarımı gerçekten yaşadığıma inanmıyorlar ve bunun sadece dikkat çekmek için bir numara olduğuna inanıyorlar.
"Ebeveynlerim, PMDD semptomlarımı ciddiye almıyor ve bunun sadece dikkat çekmek için uydurduğum bir şey olduğuna inanıyorlar."
O kadar yorgunum ki breakkkkkkkk'a ihtiyacım var!
"Öyle yorgunum ki, bir an için bile olsa her şeyi bırakıp dinlenmek istiyorum."
"Gözlerim kapanıyor, artık dayanamıyorum, mutlaka bir ara vermem gerekiyor."
"Sanki tüm enerjim tükenmiş gibi, bir mola vermeden devam edemeyeceğim."
"Yorgunluktan bitap düştüm, bir an için bile olsa dinlenmem şart."
"Kendimi zorluyorum ama artık yapabileceğim hiçbir şey yok, acil bir dinlenmeye ihtiyacım var."
Son zamanlarda kendim gibi hissetmiyorum ve başladığım zaman kadar yardımcı olduğunu hissetmiyorum. Bu korkunç hastalığa o kadar takıldım ki..
Kendim gibi hissetmiyorum ve bu hastalık benim tüm enerjimi emiyor.
"Bu hastalık hayatımı ele geçirmiş gibi hissediyorum, eskisi gibi enerjik ve motive değilim."
"Her şey beni yoruyor ve eskisi gibi mücadele edemiyorum, kendimi tamamen tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Bu hastalıkla mücadele etmek çok zor, kendimi kaybolmuş ve çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Artık eski ben değilim, bu hastalık beni çok yordu ve mücadele etmek için gücüm kalmadı."
"Acı o kadar kötü ki, sadece ölmek istiyorum."
"Bu acı dayanılmaz, yaşamak istemiyorum."
Bu kadar acı çekmektense ölmeyi tercih ederim.
"Acı o kadar yoğun ki, sadece ölerek rahatlayabilirim."
"Bu acıya katlanmak çok zor, ölmeyi düşünüyorum."
"Acı beni tüketiyor, artık yaşamak istemiyorum."
"Her ay dönemimden yaklaşık bir hafta önce son derece intihara meyilli oluyorum, işimi zar zor yapıyorum ve günün çoğunu ağlayarak geçiriyorum. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla bütün gün ağlıyorum ve duramıyorum. Patronumla bir toplantıda bile ağladım. İşe yaramazım. Her ay olur. Ayrıca bu dönemde genellikle bf'mden ayrılmaya çalışıyorum. Adetimden her hafta önce hayatım parçalanıyor gibi geliyor."
"Adet dönemimden önceki hafta her şey berbat geçiyor, işimde konsantre olamıyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum, hiçbir işe yaramıyorum, patronumun karşısında bile ağladım, kendimden nefret ediyorum."
"Bu dönemde işimi yapmakta zorlanıyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum, odaklanamıyorum, bf'mden ayrılmak istiyorum, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, her şey paramparça oluyor."
"Ayın o zamanları gelince, her şey çöküyor, ağlamadan duramıyorum, işe yaramıyorum, işe gitmeye bile zorlanıyorum, kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum."
"Adet dönemimden önce kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum, her şey çok zor geliyor, her şeyden nefret ediyorum, kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki hayatımın kontrolünü kaybetmişim gibi."
"Her ay aynı şey oluyor, dönemimden önceki hafta çok kötü hissediyorum, işimi yapamıyorum, sürekli ağlıyorum, bf'mle kavga ediyorum, hayatım alt üst oluyor."
"Sadece yemek yapmak için değil, kendimi yemek yemeye zorlamak için de çok uğraşıyorum..Ben de uyuyamıyorum. Benim dönemim uykusuzluk delice.. Kesmekten 6 hafta ayık olmak her şeyi önemli ölçüde zorlaştırdı. Sadece insanlardan bıktım..Çok stresliyim. İntiharı düşünmedim sadece uzun zamandır uyumak istiyorum.."
"Hayatımda çok fazla şeyle boğuşuyorum, sürekli olarak bu durumlarla mücadele ediyorum."
"Her şey beni tüketiyor, kendimi kaybediyorum."
"Hayat beni çok yordu, artık dayanamıyorum."
"Kendim olmakta zorlanıyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor."
"Her şeyden çok yoruldum, artık hiçbir şey hissetmiyorum."
Adetim başlamadan önce her ay kendimi öldürmeyi düşünüyorum. Ayrıca vücudumda dismorfi var...
"Adet dönemim yaklaşırken içimde bir boşluk oluşuyor, sanki yok olmak istiyorum."
"Her ay aynı şey, sanki vücudum beni terk ediyor ve ben de onunla gitmek istiyorum."
"Dismorfiyle mücadele etmek zaten zor, adetim başlamadan önce bu hisler beni daha da yıpratıyor."
"Kendimi olduğum gibi kabul edemiyorum, özellikle de adet dönemlerinde kendimi çok çirkin hissediyorum."
"Keşke bu bedenle yaşamak zorunda olmasaydım, her ay adetim başladığında bu duyguyu daha yoğun hissediyorum."
Ne kadar şişman ve çirkin olduğum için ağlıyorum.
Kendimi çok çirkin ve şişman bulduğum için çok üzgünüm.
Görünüşümün beni bu kadar mutsuz etmesi beni çok üzüyor.
Bu kadar şişman ve çirkin olduğumu düşünmek beni gerçekten mutsuz ediyor.
Kendimi beğenmemek ve çirkinliğim yüzünden ağlıyorum.
Şişmanlığım ve çirkinliğim beni çok kötü hissettiriyor.
Neredeyse 3 gündür migrenim var. Dün 3 yaşındaki arabamla Arabaları izlerken defalarca ağladım... Sadece çok hayal kırıklığına uğradım
"Son üç gündür baş ağrısıyla mücadele ediyorum, bu gerçekten çok zor."
"Migrenim beni çok yordu, dün araba kullanırken bile kendimi kötü hissettim."
"Arabayla Arabaları izlerken kendimi çok kötü hissettim, sanırım beklentilerim çok yüksekti."
Üç günlük migren ve hayal kırıklığı beni gerçekten yıktı.
"İşte böyle hissediyorum, baş ağrısı, hayal kırıklığı ve tükenmişlik..."
"Adetimden yaklaşık on gün önce kelimenin tam anlamıyla deli bir insana dönüşüyordum. Belirtilerim aşırı ağlama, öfke, mantıksızlık, aşırı yorgunluk, vücut ağrıları ve ağrı, beyin sisi idi ve intihar düşüncesi ve depresyonun derinliklerinde kalana ve yaşamın yaşamaya değmeyeceğine gerçekten inanana kadar, dönemime yavaş yavaş daha da kötüleşecekti."
"Adet döngümün başlamasına yaklaşık on gün kala, adeta bir canavara dönüşüyordum."
"Dönemimin başlamasından yaklaşık on gün önce, duygusal bir iniş çıkış yaşamaya başlıyordum."
"Her ay aynı senaryo tekrarlanıyordu: Adet dönemimin başlamasına on gün kala, ruhum karanlığa gömülecekti."
"Dönemime girmeden önceki on gün, hayatın bütün güzelliklerini unuttuğum, sadece acı ve ıstıraba odaklandığım bir cehennemdi."
"Vücudumda yaşanan hormonal değişiklikler, bir canavara dönüştüğümü hissetmeme sebep oluyordu, adeta kontrolü kaybediyordum."
Şu anda bu çayı PMDD'mi yönetmeye yardım etmek için alıyorum.
PMDD belirtilerimi hafifletmek için bu çayı içiyorum.
Bu çayın PMDD semptomlarımı azaltmaya yardımcı olacağını umuyorum.
PMDD'nin neden olduğu duygusal dalgalanmaları kontrol altında tutmak için bu çayı içmeyi deniyorum.
"Bu çay, PMDD'den kaynaklanan rahatsızlıklarımı gidermeme yardımcı olabilir."
PMDD semptomlarımın şiddetini azaltmak için bu çayı içiyorum.
"Kendimi tamamen tükenmiş hissediyorum, beynim zor bir süreç geçiriyor, anlık gevezelik beni medeni olmaya ve rahatımı korumaya zorluyor. Parçaya, sessizliğe ve etrafımdaki hiç kimseye ihtiyacım var. Zihinsel ve fiziksel olarak çok yorgunum."
"Yoğun bir günün ardından kendimi yorgun ve tükenmiş hissediyorum, her şeyden uzaklaşmak ve biraz sakinleşmek istiyorum."
"Beynim bugün çok fazla bilgiye maruz kaldı ve artık biraz sessizliğe ihtiyacım var, düşüncelerimin toplanmasını istiyorum."
"Etrafımda sürekli bir hareketlilik var ve bu beni yoruyor, kendime biraz zaman ayırmam ve dinlenmem gerekiyor."
"Fiziksel olarak da zihnen de tükenmiş hissediyorum, biraz sakinleşip kendimi toparlamam gerekiyor."
"Bu gürültü ve hareketlilik beni bunaltıyor, sessizliğe ve sakinliğe ihtiyacım var, kendimi biraz toparlayabilmem için."
"Pmdd'mde gerçekten iyileştirmeler fark etmedim, ancak dönemimden sadece 8 gün uzaktayım, bu yüzden zaman gösterecek. Bu hafta GÜÇLÜ kahve ve beyaz şarap özlemi yaşıyorum."
"Pmdd belirtilerimde pek iyileşme görmedim, ancak bir haftadan kısa bir süre sonra döneceğim, bakalım nasıl olacak."
"İlaçlar işe yarayacak mı bilmiyorum, ama umarım dönemim yaklaşınca daha iyi hissederim."
"Bu hafta kahve ve şarap çok iyi giderdi, ama kendime dikkat etmem gerek."
Dönemimin yaklaşmasıyla birlikte kendimi biraz yorgun ve canım içki çekiyor hissediyorum.
"İlaçlar işe yaramasa bile, birkaç hafta sonra dönemim geçecek ve umarım daha iyi hissedeceğim."
"Dayanılmaz acı dönemlerim var... Vücudumu zorlayamam, ayağa kalkamam ya da kalp atış hızımı yükselten herhangi bir şey yapamam ya da kramplarım dayanılmaz olacaktır."
"Kronik ağrılarım yüzünden çok zorlanıyorum. En ufak bir hareket bile dayanılmaz ağrılara sebep oluyor, bu yüzden kendimi dinlendirmek zorundayım."
"Ağrılarım o kadar şiddetli ki, hareket etmek bile çok zor. Vücudumu zorlamadan, ağrıyı azaltmak için sadece dinlenebiliyorum."
"Ağrılarım beni tamamen etkisiz hale getiriyor. Hareket edemiyorum, yürüyemiyorum, hatta derin nefes bile alamıyorum. Her şey dayanılmaz bir acıya sebep oluyor."
Acıdan dolayı günlük hayatımı sürdüremiyorum. En basit işler bile beni yorgun düşürüyor ve ağrılarımı tetikliyor. Kendimi dinlendirmek zorundayım.
"Fiziksel olarak çok kötü hissediyorum. Herhangi bir hareket ağrılarımı artırıyor, bu yüzden sadece yatıp dinlenebiliyorum."
Hangi duyguların gerçek duygular olduğunu merak ediyor musun? Hangi versiyon senin gerçek versiyonun?
"Gerçek benliğin nedir, kim olduğunu merak ediyor musun?"
Maskelerin altında yatan gerçek kimliğin ne?
Bu kadar çok rolün içinde hangisi gerçek sen?
"Duyguların mı gerçek, yoksa gösterdiğin kişi mi?"
"İç sesin mi gerçek, yoksa dış dünyaya gösterdiğin kişi mi?"
Adet dönemim ve yumurtlama haftam boyunca duygusal olarak oldukça iyi hissediyorum... Zaten luteal fazda cinsel dürtüm yok
"Adet dönemimde ve yumurtlama dönemimde daha az sinirli oluyorum, bu çok hoşuma gidiyor."
Adet dönemim ve yumurtlama dönemim boyunca kendimi genellikle çok mutlu hissediyorum.
Adet döngümün bu kısmında genelde daha enerjik ve pozitif hissediyorum.
Adet dönemim ve yumurtlama dönemim boyunca herhangi bir ruh hali değişikliği yaşamıyorum.
Adet döngümün bu aşamasında kendimi daha rahat ve özgüvenli hissediyorum.
Bir deney yaparken uyuyakaldım ve başka bir gezegende uyandım. Baş ağrısı başka hiçbir şeye benzemiyordu ve yorgunluk ve beyin sisi çok kötüydü. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla tuvalete gittim ve kırk dakika ağladım :(
"Deney sırasında uyuyakalmış olmalıyım çünkü bir anda kendimi bambaşka bir yerde buldum, hiç bilmediğim bir gezegende, nefes almakta zorlanıyordum."
"Buraya nasıl geldiğimi, nasıl uyandığımı bilmiyorum ama başım zonkluyor, kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum ve gözlerim bulanık görmeye başladı."
"Uyandığımda her şey çok garipti, her yer çok farklıydı, evrenin derinliklerinde bir gezegende bulmuştum kendimi."
"Annem beni uyandırmaya çalışırken deneyi başlatmışım, uyanınca kendimi bambaşka bir gezegende buldum, burası neresi?"
"Buraya nasıl geldiğimi bilmiyorum, ama burası bizim gezegenimiz değil, her yer çok farklı, başım zonkluyor ve yorgunluktan ayakta duramıyorum."
"Ben görev dışındayken neden çocuğumuza bakamadığını ya da evi benim için temizleyemediğini açıklamak için cehennem haftası boyunca her zaman kendine özgü bir kriz yaşar. Duygularımı kontrol etmekte sorun yaşadığımda, bana neyim olduğunu sorar ve hayatında PMDD'yi hiç duymamış gibi davranır."
"Çocuğumuza bakamadığında veya evi temizleyemediğinde sürekli olarak nedenlerini açıklamak için dramatik bir oyun sergiler, sanki dünyanın sonu gelmiş gibi."
"Evin işlerini bana devrettiğinde ben yokken neden yapamadığını açıklamak için her seferinde bir trajedye dönüştürüyor, sanki ben dünyanın en büyük suçlusuymuşum gibi."
Benim olmamamı bahane ederek evi temizlemediği veya çocuğumuza bakamadığı için sürekli olarak bana sataşır ve hayatında bir şeylerin değişmesini beklediğini ima eder.
"Ben yokken evdeki işler için yaptığı her şeyin ne kadar zor olduğunu, bana bakımlarını nasıl yaptığına dair ayrıntılı bir hikaye anlatarak anlatır, sanki hayatında başka bir şey yapmıyormuş gibi."
"Evdeki işleri neden yapamadığını açıklamak için sürekli olarak bir drama yaratan biriyle birlikte olmak, ilişkimizi bir savaş alanına dönüştürüyor, sanki ben dünyanın en kötü insanıyım gibi."
"Bu ay PMDD'm her zamankinden daha kötüydü! Birçok PMDD hastası gibi, bu noktada güneşin altında her şeyi denedim ve PMDD'm benimle kaldı ve her zamankinden daha da kötü."
"Bu ayki PMDD belirtilerim gerçekten dayanılmazdı, her zamankinden daha kötüydü!"
"PMDD'min bu ayki şiddetiyle başa çıkamıyorum, her zamankinden daha kötü!"
"Bu ay PMDD yüzünden kendimden geçmiş gibi hissediyorum, bu durum her zamankinden daha kötü!"
"Bu ay PMDD'den dolayı çok zor zamanlar geçiriyorum, daha önce hiç bu kadar kötü olmamıştı!"
"Hiçbir şey PMDD'nin bu ayki şiddetini durduramıyor, her zamankinden daha kötü!"
Bayılacakmışım gibi hissediyorum.
"Çok yorgunum, sanki bayılacak gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu kadar çok şey yaşadıktan sonra, bayılacakmışım gibi hissediyorum."
"Bugün kendimi hiç iyi hissetmiyorum, sanki bayılacak gibiyim."
Bu sıcakta bayılacakmışım gibi hissediyorum.
"Çok heyecanlıyım, sanki bayılacak gibiyim."
"Mide yanması mı geçiriyorum, bu bir panik atak mı yoksa kalp krizi mi? Panikle karışık mide yanması olduğuna eminim, kendime bu aşamadayken endişe duyduğumu hatırlatmaya çalışıyorum ama aynı zamanda çıldırmamaya çalışıyorum."
"Bu hissi tarif edemiyorum, mide yanması mı yoksa endişe mi bilmiyorum."
"Her şeyden önce sakinleşmem gerek, sanki bir kalp krizi geçirecekmişim gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu ağrı göğsümden başlıyor ve mideme iniyor, panik atak mı, kalp krizi mi yoksa mide yanması mı bilmiyorum."
"Nefes almakta zorlanıyorum, aynı anda hem mide yanması hem de panik atak yaşıyor gibiyim."
"Bu hissi bir türlü çözemiyorum, sanki her şey birden bire üzerime geliyor."
"Ormanımdaki garip bir adama, evime doğru ateş etmese daha iyi olacak bir silahla çığlık atıyorum. Ve şimdi sessizlik geri döndü bazen öfkem, normalde kaçacağım ve lol'dan saklanacağım durumlarda ayağa kalkmama izin veriyor."
"Ormanımdaki adamın, benim evime doğru ateş etmemesi daha iyi olur, çünkü bir silah taşıyorum ve öfkem, normalde kaçacağım durumlarda beni ayağa kaldırıyor."
"Beni tehdit eden adam ormandan uzaklaşmalı, yoksa çok geç olabilir ve bu sefer kaçmak yerine karşı koyacağım."
"Silahım tehlikeli ve ben de çok öfkeliyim, eğer saldırırsa pişman olacak, normalde kaçardım ama bu sefer öyle olmayacak."
"Eğer ormandaki adam bir adım daha atarsa, ateş edeceğim, çünkü normalde korkardım ama bu sefer öfkem beni kontrol ediyor."
"Sessizlik şimdi daha tehditkar çünkü öfkem beni daha cesur yapıyor, normalde kaçardım ama bu sefer karşı koyacağım."
"Cildimde iğrenç hissetmek (ağır, yağlı ve çirkin hissetmek)"
Bu kıyafetin içinde kendimi şişman ve rahatsız hissediyorum.
Yüzümde bu makyajla kendimi çok yapay ve olduğumdan farklı hissediyorum.
Saçlarımın bu kadar yağlı olması beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor.
Bu ağır ayakkabılarla yürümek beni yoruyor.
Bu dar pantolonlar içinde kendimi sıkışmış ve hareketsiz hissediyorum.
* PMDD'm için neyin işe yaradığını bulmaya gidiyorum * ve * lanet olsun bu sefaletimde dinleneceğim *. Birden çok kez denedim ve beni daha da kötüleştiriyorlar. O zaman bu benim için değil de birçok insan için işe yararsa düşündüğümden daha fazla boku yedim.
PMDD'm için bir çözüm bulmak için her yolu deneyeceğim ve bu hastalıkla mücadele etmeyi bırakmayacağım.
Bu PMDD'yle uğraşmaktan yoruldum ve sonunda işe yarayan bir şey bulmak için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım.
"Bu hastalıkla savaşmak için farklı yollar denedim, bazıları kötüleştirmişti ama vazgeçmeyeceğim."
"Bu PMDD'nin beni alt etmesine izin vermeyeceğim, sonunda işe yarayan bir şey bulana kadar mücadele etmeye devam edeceğim."
"Bir sürü tedavi denedim ama çoğu işe yaramadı, bu sefer farklı olacak, işe yarayan bir şey bulacağım."
"Zar zor konuşabiliyorum. Neredeyse bir çeşit zihinsel ve fiziksel felç gibi... Rahatsızlığımın en üzücü kısmı çünkü dış dünyadan gizleyemeyeceğim bir şey....Onunla normal bir şekilde konuşamadım ya da konuşamadım. Söyleyecek ya da ekleyecek ilginç bir şeyim yoktu, otopilotta olduğumu hissettim... Yardım edemedim ama bundan çok utandım....Her bir etkileşimi aşırı derecede inceliyorum."
"Konuşmak için gerçekten mücadele ediyorum, sanki bir tür zihinsel ve fiziksel bloke olmuş gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu rahatsızlık, gizleyemediğim bir şey olduğu için beni en çok üzen şey."
"Normal bir sohbet edemedim, hatta onunla konuşamadım bile."
İlginç bir şey söyleyemediğim için kendimi otopilotta hissettim.
Bunun için çok utandığımı hissediyorum ve her etkileşimimi aşırı analiz ediyorum.
"Belirtilerimin artık neredeyse sonuna kadar dönemim boyunca uzamaya başladığını fark ettim ve bu, tüm hafta sonu boyunca neredeyse hiçbir şey yapmadığım anlamına geliyordu. Geçirdiğim ekran süresinin miktarı delice ve şimdi çok fazla uyarılmış ve uykuya dalmak için sakinleşemediğimi hissediyorum. Endişeli. Anksiyete depresyondan neredeyse daha büyüktü, bu etrafta dolaşıyor ve nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum"
Bu dönemin sonunda belirtilerimle başa çıkmak giderek zorlaşıyor ve bu da hayatımı büyük ölçüde etkiliyor.
"Geçen hafta sonunu neredeyse hiç aktivite yapmadan geçirdim, tüm zamanımı ekran başında geçirdim ve şimdi uyuya kalmak için kendimi sakinleştirmekte zorlanıyorum."
Geçen hafta sonu geçirdiğim ekran süresi anormal derecede yüksekti ve bu beni aşırı uyarılmış ve endişeli hissettirdi.
"Uyuya kalmakta zorlanıyorum ve kendimi endişeli ve anksiyete içinde hissediyorum, hatta depresyonun bile bu hissin yanında ikinci plana düştüğünü düşünüyorum."
"Artık bu durumun üstesinden nasıl geleceğimi bilmiyorum, her geçen gün daha da kötüleşiyor ve beni korkutuyor."
Her sabah gözlerimi dışarı atmak ve en ufak bir şey hakkında beni kızdırırsa süper reaktif olmak istiyorum. Deli hissediyorum. Çekip onlardan uzaklaştım ve hepsi gidip kahvaltı yaparken beni kampta bırakmaya devam ettiler. Yarım saat kadar çok sert bir şekilde ağladım. Şu anda son derece hassas ve mantıksız olduğumu biliyorum ve bir grup ipucusuz adamla çevrili olmak beni daha da dengesiz hissettiriyor.
"Gerçekten de, gün boyunca herkesi uyarmak ve beni en ufak şeyde bile sinirlendirirlerse kavga etmek istiyorum. İnsanlar bana tuhaf bakıyor ve ben ne olup bittiğini bilmiyorum."
"Onlara nasıl davranacaklarını bildiklerini söyledim ve bu yeterince iyi değildi. Bana saygı göstermiyorlardı, bu yüzden onları susturmaya çalıştım."
"Sabahtan beri gerçekten kötü bir ruh halindeyim ve herkes beni sadece daha da sinirlendiriyor. Benden uzaklaşmaları, beni yalnız bırakmaları ve beni rahat bırakmaları gerekiyor."
"Bu insanların beni bu şekilde hissettirmelerinin anlamını anlamıyorum. Benimle neyin yanlış olduğunu düşünüyorlarsa da, yanlış."
"Çok sinirliyim ve kimse beni anlamıyor. Beni bırakmaları gerekiyor, çünkü ben sadece herkese bağırmak ve bağırtmak istiyorum."
"İş yerindeki insanlarla bile konuşmakta zorlanıyorum, tonum çok sert ve ani, yüzüm taşsız. Gerçekten her şeyin üstesinden geliyorum ve hatta iş bile yeterince bunaltıcı."
"İş yerinde insanlarla iletişim kurmak beni çok yordu, kendimi her gün daha yalnız hissediyorum."
"Duygularımı ifade etmekte zorlanıyorum, sanki bir duvar örülmüş gibi, kimse beni anlamıyor."
"İşim çok stresli, sürekli bir baskı altında hissediyorum, sanki beynim yorulmuş gibi."
"Kendimi herkese karşı savunmasız hissediyorum, sanki bir kabuğa çekilmişim gibi."
"İnsanlarla iletişim kurmaktan korkuyorum, sanki yanlış bir şey yapacağım gibi hissediyorum."
Sadece gittim ve kestim (benden çok farklı)
Bu benim tarzım değil ama yine de yaptım.
Normalde böyle davranmam ama bu sefer farklıydı.
Bilmiyorum neden ama kendimden çıktım.
Benim gibi değil ama hissettim ki bunu yapmak zorundaydım.
Bunu yapmayı beklemiyordum ama işte oldu.
Travmanın üstesinden gelmeye çalışıyorum... Gittikçe daha da ağırlaşan pmdd'mi geliştirdim.
"Travma ile mücadele etmek benim için zorlu bir süreç, üstelik PMDD de gitgide kötüleşiyor."
"Geçmişteki travmaların etkisini atlatmaya çalışıyorum, ancak aynı zamanda PMDD'nin daha da kötüleşmesiyle boğuşuyorum."
"Travma sonrasında iyileşmek istiyorum, fakat PMDD'nin şiddetlenmesiyle mücadele ediyorum."
İyileşmek için çabalıyorum ama PMDD'nin gittikçe ağırlaşmasıyla başa çıkmak zorlaşıyor.
"Travmanın izlerini silmeye çalışıyorum, ancak PMDD'nin etkisi daha da artıyor."
Bazı nedenlerden dolayı kendimi onları (ya da başka bir şeyi) yapmaya zorlayamam.
"Bu konuda kendimi zorlamak istemiyorum, belki başka bir zaman."
"Bunları yapmaya kendimi zorlamam gerekiyor, ancak bunun için hazır değilim."
Bu görevleri yapmak için kendimi motive edemiyorum.
"Kendimi, bunun için doğru zamanda olmadığımı düşünüyorum, yapmaya zorlayamıyorum."
İsteksizliğimden dolayı kendimi bu eylemi yapmaya zorlayamıyorum.
"Bunun yerine yaşam boyunca ""yüzdüğümü"" söylemeye başladım. Hayat gerçek değil, gerçekten yaşıyormuşum gibi hissettirmiyor. Çok garip bir his, bilinçli olarak burada değilmişim gibi. Belki de beyin sisinin bir parçasıdır, idk. Çok ""vücudun dışında""."
"Yaşama tutunmak için bir hayali savunuyorum gibi hissediyorum, sanki gerçekte hissetmiyor olsam da."
"Hayatın gerçekliğiyle bağlantı kurmakta zorlanıyorum, sanki bir film izliyormuşum gibi hissediyorum."
"Kendi bedenimde değilmişim gibi hissediyorum, sanki dünya dışından bakan biriyim."
"Gündelik hayatımı yaşayan biri gibi hissetmiyorum, sanki bir rüya yaşıyormuşum gibi."
"Sanki bir hayaleti oynuyormuşum gibi, gerçeği anlamıyor gibi hissediyorum."
Benim için daha yeni bir semptom gece terlemeleridir. Ayın saatinden bağımsız olarak dinlenirken üşümeye eğilimliyim (eklemlerime toplam bok dolaşımı.
Son zamanlarda gece terlemesiyle çok uğraşıyorum. Gece saatinden bağımsız olarak üşüdüğümü hissediyorum.
"Gece terlemesi beni epey rahatsız etmeye başladı, sanki gece boyunca üşüyorum."
Gece terlemesi benim için yeni bir semptom. Ayın saatinden bağımsız olarak uykuda üşüdüğümü hissediyorum.
Bu son zamanlarda gece terlemesiyle çok uğraşıyorum. Özellikle de geceleyin soğuk hissediyorum.
Gece terlemesi beni çok endişelendiriyor. Dinlenirken üşümekten dolayı uykumdan uyanıyorum.
Adetimin hızlı bitmesi veya durması için acil bir çözüme ihtiyacım var.
"Adet sancım çok şiddetli ve uzun sürüyor, bu durum beni çok yoruyor."
"Adet dönemim çok düzensiz ve tahmin edilemez, bu da günlük yaşantımı olumsuz etkiliyor."
"Adet kanamalarım çok fazla ve rahatsız edici, bu durum günlük hayatımı engelliyor."
Adet döngümün normal seyrinde olmaması nedeniyle endişeleniyorum ve bir çözüm arıyorum.
Adet sorunlarım nedeniyle işime ve sosyal hayatıma odaklanamıyorum.
"Sırt çantamda ve okul sırt çantamda bir backscratcher tutuyorum, çünkü tüm sırtım, koltuk altlarım ve aşk sapı alanım her ay aynı zamanda süper kaşıntılı oluyor. Kocama beni mümkün olduğunca sert çizmesi için yalvarıyorum. Komik... Evde geçirdiğim süre boyunca geriye baktığımda, annem bazen beni kişisel sırt kaşıyıcı yapar. Kesinlikle PMDD'li birinin işaretlerini gösterdi, bağlanabilir."
"Adet döngüm sırasında sırtım, koltuk altlarım ve aşk sapım inanılmaz derecede kaşınıyor. Bu yüzden her zaman yanımda sırt kaşıyıcım olur."
"Sırtımı kaşımak için kocamdan yardım istemek zorunda kalıyorum, ama o bazen sert çizerek beni güldürüyor."
"Annem çocukluğumda beni çok sık sırtımı kaşırdı, galiba o da adet döngüsü sırasında benzer problemler yaşıyordu."
"PMDD'nin belirtileri gerçekten can sıkıcı olabiliyor, özellikle sırt kaşıntısı."
"Sırtımı kaşımak için sürekli bir şeylere ihtiyaç duyuyorum, bazen koltuk altlarım bile kaşınıyor."
"Gençliğimden beri klinik depresyon ve anksiyete yaşadım, bu yüzden herhangi bir şey olmadan önce çok fazla korkmak için kendi yoluma çıkma konusunda endişeliyim, eğer herhangi bir şey olacaksa"
"Korkularımın, umutlu hissetme şansımı elimden alacağından endişeleniyorum."
Daha önce de yaşadığım şeyleri tekrar yaşamaktan korkuyorum.
Olumsuz düşüncelerimin benim için bir engel oluşturmasından korkuyorum.
Mutlu olmayı hak etmediğimi düşünmek beni korkutuyor.
Kendi kendime bir şeyler yapabileceğimden endişe ediyorum.
Sürekli ağlamamı ve SI'mı ilaçlar ve terapi ile idare ettim ama şimdi sadece ilgisiz hissediyorum. Çürümek veya uyumaktan başka bir şey yapmak istemiyorum.
"Artık hiçbir şeyden zevk almıyorum, sadece boşluk hissediyorum."
Hayatımı ilaçlar ve terapiyle geçiriyorum ama hiçbir şey işe yaramıyor.
"Her şey bana boş ve anlamsız geliyor, hiçbir şeye ilgi duymuyorum."
"Sanki kendi bedenimde yabancıymışım gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şeyden zevk almıyorum."
"Her şeyden vazgeçtim, sadece uyuyup her şeyi unutmak istiyorum."
Bir şeylerin yanlış gittiğinden endişe ediyorum.
Bir şeylerin yolunda gitmediğini düşünüyorum.
Her şeyin yolunda olup olmadığından emin değilim.
Durumun iyiye gitmediğini hissediyorum.
Bir şeyler ters gidiyor gibi hissediyorum.
Bana bir şeyler yanlış gidiyor gibi geliyor.
"Bazen bir looong zaman için iyiyim..., ne zaman zihinsel sağlığım işte kötüleşiyordu ve bırakmak zorunda olduğumu hormonlardan kaynaklanıyormuş gibi hissettim. Ya da arkadaşlarımla dışarı çıktığım ve bir anksiyete krizi geçirdiğim her zaman... sadece iki haftalık çılgın kaygı ve rahatsızlık / umutsuzluk için hazırlanmak için iki haftalık eğlence."
"İki hafta boyunca harika hissediyorum, sonra ani bir dalgalanma oluyor, zihnim beni yarı yolda bırakıyor ve sanki vücudumda bir şey yanlış, hormonlarla ilgili bir şey, beni bir hafta boyunca yere serıyor."
"Bir an için harika hissediyorum, ama o zaman zihnim beni ele geçiriyor ve hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor.  Sanki vücudumun içinden bir şey beni yıkıyor, iki hafta boyunca kötü hissediyorum."
"Kendimi gerçekten iyi hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor, ama sonra ani bir değişim hissediyorum. Sanki bir şey beni içten içe kemiriyor,  dışarı çıkıp eğlenemiyorum. "
"Her şey yolunda gibi hissediyorum, sonra bir anksiyete krizi başlıyor ve iki hafta boyunca hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor. "
"Hayat harika gidiyor, sonra aniden zihnim kararıyor, hiçbir şey yapamıyorum ve iki haftalık bir depresyon dönemi başlıyor."
"PMDD her vurduğunda, sadece her şeyi geride bırakmak ve bir köye başlamak / katılmak ve orada bir grup başka kadınla kendi kendine yeterli bir şekilde yaşamak istiyorum... Sadece gerçekten, gerçekten luteal fazımda bir sürü kadın arkadaşa sahip olma dürtüsünü alıyorum."
"PMDD'nin etkisiyle kendimi tamamen yalnız ve dışlanmış hissediyorum, sanki tüm dünya bana karşıymış gibi."
"Bu dönemde hayatın karmaşıklığından uzaklaşmak, sessiz bir ormanda tek başıma yaşamak ve her şeyden uzaklaşmak istiyorum."
"İçinde bulunduğum bu duygusal durum, bana kendimi tamamen yalnız ve yabancı hissettiriyor, sanki herkes beni anlamakta zorlanıyormuş gibi."
"Bu dönemde sosyalleşmek, insanlar arasında olmak yerine kendime çekilmek ve sakin kalmak istiyorum, sanki etrafımdaki her şey beni üzer gibi."
"PMDD'nin etkisiyle sadece kendimi değil, herkesi de yargıladığımı hissediyorum, sanki bu benim kontrolüm dışında bir şeymiş gibi."
HAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Vay canına! Çok heyecan verici!
"İnanamıyorum, bu muhteşem!"
"Bu inanılmaz, çok mutluyum!"
"Oh, benim canım! Ne harika!"
"Bu harika, çok heyecanlıyım!"
"Çoğu zaman, belirtilerimin hepsi kafamın içindeymiş gibi geliyor."
Belirtilerim çoğu zaman sadece zihnimin bir oyunu gibi hissettiriyor.
Sanki tüm bu rahatsızlıklar sadece hayal gücümün bir ürünüymüş gibi geliyor.
Bazen gerçeklikten koptuğumu ve her şeyin sadece kafamda olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Fiziksel belirtilerim olsa da, çoğu zaman sanki bunların kaynağı sadece zihnimmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Birçoğu gerçekmiş gibi hissetse de, belirtilerimin çoğu gerçekte sadece kafamın içinde olup biten şeylermiş gibi geliyor."
"Korkuyorum. PMDD belirtilerim, kanamaya başladıktan sonra sihirli bir şekilde gitmez, tipik olarak 8-10 günlük aşırı ağır ve ağrılı kanamamın içine birkaç gün sürer.... Kendimden zevk alamayacağımdan korkuyorum. Ailesinin ne kadar çılgın bir sürtük olabileceğimi anlayacağından korkuyorum. Herkes için işleri mahvedeceğimden korkuyorum. Herkes keyif alırken ve biz gibi görünmeden rahatsız olmaktan korkuyorum."
PMDD belirtilerimden dolayı kendimi kontrol edemeyeceğimden korkuyorum.
Kanama sırasında yaşadığım yoğun duygusal dalgalanmaların beni kontrolden çıkaracağından endişeleniyorum.
"Bu belirtiler sırasında çevremdekileri incitebileceğimden korkuyorum, sanki kendim değilim gibi."
Ailemin beni bu halde görerek yargılayacağından ve beni anlayamayacağından korkuyorum.
Bu durumun tüm sosyal yaşamımı alt üst edeceğinden ve herkese yük olacağımdan korkuyorum.

Yumurtlamanın zirvesinden indiğimde vücudumun bana saldırdığını hissediyorum. Aniden mide bulantısı ve gelen bir baş ağrısı hissediyorum.
"Yumurtlama döneminin sona ermesiyle bedenimde bir kaos başlıyor, adeta bana karşı savaş açıyor."

2011 yılından bu yana bipolar ve depresyon için teşhis kondu ve tedavi edildim... PMDD'm olduğunu hissediyorum. Şimdi değil dedi bb istikrarlıyım. Ancak bipolar olduğumu ya da hiç bulunmadığımı düşünmüyorum. Her ay sadece hormonal bir sürtüğüm ve bunun için tedaviye ihtiyacım var.
"Son 8 yıldır bipolar ve depresyon teşhisiyle yaşıyorum ve tedavi görüyorum... Ancak son zamanlarda PMDD'm olduğunu hissediyorum. Doktorlar şu an bunun için bir teşhis koyamadılar, çünkü bipolariteyle bağlantılı olabilir ve ilaçlarla dengede tutulabiliyor. Fakat ben her ay hormonlarımla savaştığımı ve bunun için yardıma ihtiyacım olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Yıllarca bipolar ve depresyonla mücadele ettim, ilaçlarla kontrol altında tutuyorum ama artık PMDD'nin de hayatımda olduğunu hissediyorum.

Hapı aldığımdan beri çok kızgın ve hassastım ve hapını yeni fark ettim. Son iki gündür erkek arkadaşım Alot'a karşı patlıyorum ya da kaba davranıyorum ve çok kötü hissediyorum çünkü o sadece iyi niyetli ve bu hapların insanlara nasıl davrandığımı etkilemesine izin vermek istemiyorum. Bu lanet yan etkilerden üzüntü ve saf öfkeden başka bir duygum yok gibi hissediyorum.
"Son iki gündür çok sinirli ve hassasım, hapın etkisi geçmedi sanırım."
"Bu hapların insanları nasıl etkilediğini bilmiyordum, aşırı sinirli ve hassas olmamın sebebi bu ilaçlar olmalı."

Kendimi bahçe hortumu ile günde 4 saat oynamak yerine normal bir çocuk gibi oynamayı dilerken buluyorum.

Ağlamak istiyorum. Bugün 5 kez aptalca şeyler için ağladım ve şimdi bir başarısızlık olduğumu hissediyorum. Birisi benimle konuşmaya çalıştığında ve bu gece akşam yemeği yapmayı düşündüğümde aklımı kaybedeceğimi hissediyorum.

Yapmak istediğim çok fazla plan, hırs ve eğlenceli projem vardı ve yine de yapabileceğim tek şey yemek yemek, uyumak ve telefonumla dikkatimi dağıtmak. Her şey bunaltıcı ve burada nefret ediyorum, çok umutsuz hissediyorum ve her şeyin arkasında düşüyormuşum gibi hissediyorum."
"Adet dönemin gelmesiyle her şey ağırlaştı, sanki tüm enerjim çekilip alınmış gibi hissediyorum. Yapabileceğim tek şey yatağa yatmak ve kendimi umutsuzluğa bırakmak."
"Her ay aynı şey; kendini işe yaramaz ve tükenmiş hissetmek, sanki tüm hayatın durmuş gibi. Yapmak istediğim o kadar çok şey var ki, ama hiçbirine gücüm yok."
"Bu depresif dönem bitmek bilmiyor, sanki bir ağırlık üzerimde duruyor ve beni yere bağlıyor. Her şey bunaltıcı ve hiçbir şeye enerjim yok."

"Lütfen bir çözüm bulun, bu kaşıntılar beni perişan ediyor."

"Bugün kendimi kesinlikle masif hissediyorum ve yabancıların beni gördüklerinde düşünmeleri gereken ilk şeyin ""Ne biçimsiz bir balon"" olduğunu varsayarken ne kadar bencil olduğumdan nefret ediyorum.

O kadar inanılmaz duygusal olacağım ki meydana gelen her olay olumsuz bir şeye dönüşecek... Ondan son derece şüpheleneceğim... Söylediği her şeye aşırı hakaret edeceğim... Yüz ifadelerini veya ses tonunu sürekli olarak olumsuz bir şekilde yorumlayacağım... Her zaman onun kızgın ya da üzgün olduğunu düşüneceğim / beni sevmediğini / artık böyle hissedemiyorum...
"O kadar kaygı içindeyim ki, en ufak bir şey bile ilişkimizi zedeleyen bir şeye dönüşecek."
"En ufak bir yanlış anlaşılma bile, ilişkimizi tehlikeye atacağından eminim."
"Her şeyi kötüye yoracağım, onun söylediklerinin hepsi bana ters gelecek."
"Söylediği her sözü abartacak, her davranışını kötüye yorumlayacağım."
"Sürekli olarak şüphe duyacağım, onunla olan ilişkimizin bittiğini düşüneceğim."
Gençliğimden beri PMDD'den muzdaripim ve sinirli olmaktan tam anlamıyla intihara meyilli olmaya ve yataktan çıkamamaya kadar çeşitlidir.

Sanki üzerimdeki yük hafiflemiş gibi hissediyorum.
Hiç olmadığım kadar rahat ve huzurluyum.
Genellikle beni rahatsız eden şeyler şu anda bana dokunmuyor.
"Davranışlarımı değiştirmek / PMDD'yi yenmek ve kendimi ve bozukluğu kabul etmeyi öğrenmek arasında sürekli bir savaşta olduğumu hissediyorum....Kimsenin beni sevmediğine, kimsenin bana tamamen zaman ayıramadığına ve diğer insanlara istenmeyen bir yük olduğuna inanmanın aşağı yönlü bir spiraline girdim. Görünmeyen ve çirkin hissettim. Bu şekilde hissettiğim için kendimden nefret etmeye başladım ve eğlenceli bir yolculuğun önüne geçmesine izin vermedim....Kendime çok kızgın hissettim!"
"PMDD'nin benim için yaratığı tüm acı ve hayal kırıklığına rağmen, yine de kendimi ve duygularımı kabul etmeyi öğrenmeye çalışıyorum."
"Bir zamanlar, hayatımı olumsuz düşünceler ve kendime olan güvensizlikler kaplamıştı; ben sadece kötü, sevilmeyen ve çirkin biriydim."
"Hayatım bir savaş alanına dönüştü; bir yanda PMDD'nin öfkesi, diğer yanda kendimi kabul etme arayışı."
"Güvensizliklerin, kendimi değersiz hissetmemin ve öfkenin beni her geçen gün daha da yutmasına izin vermek istemiyordum."

"Ben luteal sırasında benim sinirlilik çıtlatmak için neden oldu önce anlar vardı, ama bu yeni bir şey oldu ve ben öz kontrol eksikliği utanıyorum... bu yüzden dün sabah 6:00'da bir yurttaşın kötü sürücüsünden özür dilerim, benim arka ve bir topuz olmak çok yakındı, ama ben penceremden bağırarak beni hak şüphe ve size kuş tüyme. Daha sonra ben aslında tüm bu hafta boyunca insanlar post videoları gibi hissettim."

Gelecekten korkuyordum ve intihar etmekten başka çare göremiyordum.
Çok kötü bir haldeydim ve kendimi öldürmekle ilgili düşüncelerim vardı.
Bazen belirli bir şeye takılıp kalabilirim... Son Luther evremde birisi benim kötü bir ebeveyn olduğumu öne sürdü... ama ailemi terk etmek ya da ölmek istediğim noktaya söylediklerini duyduktan sonra kafama çok kötü takıldı çünkü çok kötü bir anne olduğumu düşündüm. Ve diğer müdahaleci düşünceler...
Bazen çok fazla düşünürüm... Biri yakın zamanda bir arkadaşlıkta bana haksızlık yaptığını söyledi... ve o zamandan beri bunun hakkında durmadan düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum çünkü söyledikleri gerçekten canımı sıktı.
Yine kötü bir ruh halindeyim... Geçenlerde bir arkadaşım bana bir şeyde haksız olduğumu söyledi... ve düşünmeden önce bunu çok kişisel olarak algıladım. Bundan dolayı kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Bazen bir şey gerçekten kafamı kurcalıyor... Birkaç gün önce patronum bana bir projede çok kötü davrandığını söyledi... ve bundan beri bunun hakkında durmadan düşünüyorum çünkü bu konu beni gerçekten rahatsız etti.
Bazen ufak tefek şeyler bile canımı sıkabiliyor... Yakın zamanda bir aile üyesi bana yaptığım bir şey için eleştirdi... ve o zamandan beri bunun hakkında düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum çünkü söyledikleri bana çok dokunmuştu.
Bazen ufak tefek şeylere takılıp kalıyorum... Geçenlerde biri bana davranışımı sorguladı... ve bu bana o kadar kötü geldi ki o zamandan beri bunun hakkında düşünmeyi bırakamadım.

Bu her ay PMDD'm kötü olduğunda veya dönemim gelmek üzereyken olur. PMDD'nin bu bölümünden nefret ediyorum. Yaptığım hiçbir şey doğru ya da iyi görünmüyor, hiçbir şey bana benzemiyor ya da benim gibi hissetmiyor."
"Bu aynadaki yansıma benim değilmiş gibi görünüyor, sanki bir başkasına aitmiş gibi."

Duygusal ve fiziksel olarak küfürlüler ve kız kardeşim bir zorba, kendimi kötü hissediyorum. Sıkışmış hissediyorum ve onlarla tüm bağları koparmak istiyorum."
Ailemin beni anlamaması ve PMDD'nin gerçek olduğunu kabul etmeyişleri beni çok üzüyor.
"Onlar beni dinlemiyor, sanki sadece kafamda bir şey uyduruyormuşum gibi davranıyorlar."
"Ailemin desteği olmadan kendimi çok yalnız ve çaresiz hissediyorum, sanki bu savaşta tek başımaymışım gibi."

Ciddi şekilde depresyondaydım ve bir sürü olumsuz semptom yaşadım. Ve dönemim boyunca hareket edemedim çünkü kramplarım çok kötü ve vücudum ağrıyordu. Yarı normal hissettiğim her aydan sadece bir haftam vardı.

"Depresyonun bedenime ve ruh halime verdiği zarar o kadar büyüktü ki, kendimi tamamen güçsüz ve çaresiz hissediyordum."
"Hayatımdaki her şeyi bırakmak istiyormuşum gibi hissediyorum... Bütün hafta sonu ağlıyordum, yarın işe gitmek için son derece endişeliydim. Sadece yorgunum ve iki yaşındaki ve kocam için korkunç bir insan gibi hissediyorum, onlar için tam olarak hazır olamam. Hayatta umudumu kaybediyorum, sanki hiçbir zaman pozitif olmaya çalıştığım hayallere veya arzulara sahip olmayacağım gibi ve çok umutsuz hissediyorum."
"Hayatın tüm yükünden kurtulmak istiyordum, sanki hiç başlamadan bırakmışım gibi."
"Hafta sonunu ağlayarak geçirdim, her şey beni bunaltıyor ve yorgun hissettiriyor."
"İki yaşındaki çocuğum ve kocam için endişeleniyorum, onlara gereken ilgiyi gösteremiyorum."
"Hayallerim ve hedeflerimle ilgili tüm umudumu kaybetmiş gibi hissediyorum, sanki asla gerçekleşmeyeceklermiş gibi."
"Bu kadar yorgun ve mutsuz hissediyorum ki, hayatımdaki tüm pozitifliği kaybetmişim gibi geliyor."

"Bu kadar çok şeyle boğuşmak beni çok yordu, sanki içimde bir kara delik açılmış gibiyim..."
"Kendimi tamamen tükenmiş hissediyorum, sanki içimde bir fırtına kopmuş gibi..."
Normalde çok kararlı ve iyimser bir insanımdır ama PMDD'm tüm bunları kafaya takar - hastalığım vurduğunda kim olduğumdan iğrenirim.
"PMDD'nin etkisiyle ben, genellikle olduğumdan çok farklı, sinirli ve umutsuz biri oluyorum."
Normalde pozitif ve güçlü bir bireyim ancak PMDD beni adeta bambaşka bir insan haline getiriyor.
"Hastalık belirtileri başladığında, o kadar kötü hissediyorum ki kendimi tanımıyorum bile."
"PMDD,  içsel dengemi altüst ediyor ve beni kendimden uzaklaştırıyor."
Bu hastalıkla boğuşurken kendimi tanıyamayacak kadar farklı bir insana dönüşüyorum.
Bazen ertesi günün nasıl yakın olduğunu düşünürdüm ve bu benim kaygı/imparatorluk kıyametimi harekete geçirirdi. Sanki ertesi gün lol'dan korkuyormuşum gibi.

"Geleceğe dair belirsizlik beni her zaman tedirgin eder, sanki kötü bir şeyin başıma geleceğini biliyormuşum gibi."
"Sanki bir fırtına öncesi sessizlik gibi, ertesi günün getirdiği belirsizlik beni korkutuyordu."
"Her gece, ertesi günün neler getireceğini düşünerek uyuyordum, sanki korkunç bir şeye hazırlanıyormuşum gibi."
"Zamanın nasıl geçtiğini anlayamıyordum, ertesi günün ani gelişi beni her zaman tedirgin ederdi."
"- Kokulara, seslere, ışığa aşırı duyarlı. Çevremdeki sevmediğim ve normalde umursamadığım herhangi bir değişiklik beni hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkıra hıçkırdım."
"- Her türlü gürültü, koku, ışık beni aşırı etkiliyor. Çevremdeki herhangi bir değişiklik bile beni çıldırtıyor."
"- En ufak ses, koku, ışık bile beni huzursuz ediyor. En ufak değişiklik bile benim için dayanılmaz."
"- Kokular, sesler, ışık, hepsi beni rahatsız ediyor. Etrafımdaki her şey benim için bir işkence."
- Çok hassasım. Etrafımdaki ufak tefek değişiklikler bile beni çıldırtabiliyor.
- Normalde önemsemediğim şeylerin bile şimdi çok kötü olduğunu düşünüyorum. Her şey beni çok rahatsız ediyor.
"Aslında bunu yapmaya daha da yaklaşıyorum, arkadaşlarla etkinlikler planlıyorum, onları son kez görmenin ya da 50 sayfalık notlar yazmanın kötü olduğunu bilerek."

"Arkadaşlarımla son kez vakit geçirmek istiyorum, çünkü mezun olduktan sonra birbirimizi görmek zor olacak."
"Gerçekten yorgun hissettim, ama biraz kestirdim ve sonra bir şekilde kaçtı. Ayrıca bazen gerçekten soğuk ve diğer zamanlarda gerçekten sıcak hissettim.... Oldukça açık fikirli hissetmeye başladım ve bu his bu sabah hala benimle. PMDD sisin gittiğini hissediyorum."
"Yorgunluğum geçti, ama hala biraz yorgun hissediyorum. Gerçekten tuhaf hissediyorum, sanki kendimde değilim."

Yaklaşan 'kurtadam haftası' konusunda hala endişeliydim. Ruh halim/duygusal semptomlarım olmadığı için dönemim bu gece tamamen beklenmedik bir şekilde geldi.
"Yaklaşan 'kurtadam haftası' hakkında endişeliydim ama garip bir şekilde, dönemim bu gece tamamen beklenmedik bir şekilde geldi."
"Duygusal semptomlarımı hissetmiyordum, bu yüzden dönemim bu gece ansızın gelince şaşırdım."
"'Kurtadam haftası'na hazırlandığımı düşünüyordum ama sanırım yanılmışım, çünkü dönemim bugün tamamen beklenmedik bir şekilde başladı."
"Sanki her şey normal gibiydi, sonra aniden dönemim geldi. Hiçbir belirti yoktu, hatta biraz 'kurtadam haftası' belirtisi bile görmüyordum."
Biraz huysuz ve şişkin hissediyordum ama 'kurtadam haftası' semptomları çok şiddetli değildi. Sonra aniden dönemim geldi ve şaşırdım.
"Geçtiğimiz birkaç ay boyunca semptomlarımın luteal, period ve foliküler fazımın çoğunu taşıdığını fark ettim... Belirtilerim her zaman yumurtlama penceresinin etrafında ölür ve luteal fazın ortasında son derece dayanılmaz hale gelir."
"Adet döngümün luteal, period ve foliküler fazlarında, özellikle yumurtlama penceresinin etrafında ve luteal fazın ortasında şiddetlenen semptomlar yaşıyorum."

"Adet döngümün özellikle luteal ve foliküler fazları olmak üzere her evresinde belirli semptomlar yaşıyorum, bunlar yumurtlama penceresinin etrafında ve luteal fazın ortasında şiddetleniyor."
Sürekli semptomlarımı yönetmeye ya da yönetmeye o kadar odaklandım ki artık kendimi tam olarak bir insan olarak görmüyorum. Görünüşümü ya da kıyafetlerimin nasıl uyduğunu ya da saçlarımın uzun süre omuzlarımda yattığını fark etmedim - hayatta kalmaya çalışmakla çok meşgulüm.
"Hastalığımla mücadele etmekle o kadar meşgulüm ki, normal bir hayat yaşamayı unuttum."
"Yaşamayı unutmuş gibi hissediyorum, çünkü her şey hastalığımla mücadele etmek üzerine dönüyor."
"Kendimi sürekli hastalığımla mücadele eden biri olarak tanımlıyorum, artık normal bir insan gibi hissetmiyorum."
"Hayatta kalmaya odaklandığım için, kendime bakmayı ve kendimi önemsemeyi unutmuşum."
"Hastalıkla mücadele etmek hayatımın merkezine yerleşmiş, artık kendimi kaybettiğimi düşünüyorum."
'Sarhoş Progesteron' bir deneyimdir - Yiyeceklerin gücü ikiye katladığını fark etmemiştim.
'Sarhoş Progesteron' hayatın her anını daha yoğun yaşamaya sebep oluyor - İnsanlarımı daha önce hiç bu kadar sevdiğimi hissetmemiştim.
'Sarhoş Progesteron' sanki hayatın rengini değiştiriyor - Her şey daha parlak ve daha canlı görünüyor.
'Sarhoş Progesteron'ın beni nasıl değiştirdiğini bilmiyorum ama bu durumdan gerçekten keyif alıyorum - Kendimi daha rahat ve özgür hissediyorum.
'Sarhoş Progesteron' gerçekten de bir yolculuk - Önceki benliğimin artık kim olduğunu hatırlamıyorum.
'Sarhoş Progesteron'la her şey daha kolay - Sanki tüm sorunlarım bir anda ortadan kayboluyor.
"Her zaman ailemle, erkek arkadaşımla, panik ataklarla, depresyonla vb. kavga ederdim, kendimi soyutlardım ve asla insanlarla sosyalleşmezdim."
"Her zaman kendimi dünyadan soyutlardım, kendimi kimseye açmazdım."
Kendimi sürekli olarak ilişkilere ve insanlara karşı savunmasız hissediyordum.
"İletişim kurmaktan ve sosyalleşmekten korkardım, bu yüzden hep kendimi izole ettim."
"En yakın ilişkilerimde bile kendimi güvensiz ve savunmasız hissederdim, bu yüzden hep uzaklaşmaya çalışırdım."
"Her şeyin kontrolünü kaybettiğimi hissettiğimde kendimi geri çeker, sosyalleşmekten uzak dururdum."
"En kötü PMDD semptomlarımdan (ciddi depresif düşünceler) iki yıl boyunca oldukça sağlam bir rahatlamadan sonra, ilacım benim için etkinliğini kaybediyor gibi görünüyor."
Birkaç yıl boyunca PMDD semptomlarımı kontrol altında tutan ilaç artık işe yaramıyor gibi görünüyor.
İlacım benim için işe yaramıyor gibi görünüyor ve en kötü PMDD semptomlarıma geri dönüyorum.
"İlaçlar artık en kötü PMDD semptomlarım için işe yaramıyor, özellikle de depresif düşüncelerim."
En kötü PMDD semptomlarımdan birkaç yıl boyunca beni kurtaran ilaçlar artık işe yaramıyor.
PMDD semptomlarım ilacım işe yaramayı bıraktığından beri daha da kötüleşiyor.
"Kesinlikle delirdiğimi sandım... Panik hissediyorum... Kendim gibi görünmüyorum ve bu acı verici ve korkutucu. Cildimin bu grimsi renge döndüğünü hissediyorum, şişiyor ve gözlerimin altı 3 aydır uyumamış gibi görünüyor. Gülüşüm sahte görünüyor... korkunç :("
"Bu süreçte kendimi kaybetmiş hissediyorum, sanki bir yabancıya dönüştüm."
"Her şey o kadar yoğun ve karmaşık ki, artık gerçeklikten kopmuş gibi hissediyorum."
Sanki içimde bir boşluk oluşmuş ve bunun bir sonu yokmuş gibi hissediyorum.
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, her şey dağılıyor, çöküyorum."
Bu kadar kötü hissetmemem gerektiğini biliyorum ama kendimi durduramıyorum.
"Yaklaşık 5 yıldır PMDD'm var ve bugün resmi olarak teşhis konması için jino kliniğine gittim, böylece cehennem haftası için işte kalacak yer bulabildim (ve ayrıca her ay şiddetli yumurtlama ağrısı hakkında danışmak için). Geçirdiğim hemşire pratiğe ciddi şekilde hayal kırıklığına uğradım."
Uzun zamandır PMDD ile mücadele ediyorum ve sonunda teşhis için jino kliniğine gittim. Şimdi belki işte kalacak yer bulabileceğim.
"Her ay şiddetli ağrılarla uğraşıyorum, sonunda jino kliniğine gittim ve resmi olarak teşhis konuldu."
"Geçirdiğim hemşire pratiği yeterince yardımcı olmadı, bugün jino kliniğine gittim ve PMDD teşhisi aldım."
"PMDD teşhisi almak için jino kliniğine gittim, hemşire pratiğindeki kötü deneyimden sonra umutluyum."
Yıllardır süren şiddetli yumurtlama ağrılarım ve PMDD için sonunda teşhis almaya gidiyorum.
Ben bir şeyler satın alma söz konusu olduğunda ben self control bir Complete Lack var. Her rastgele düşünce ben çevrimiçi bakmak ve bir araba koymak bir şeye dönüşür. Ben aslında satın almak ve para yok ihtiyacım olmayan şeylerin çoğu (rastgele).
"Alışverişe gelince, kendimi kontrol edemiyorum. Herhangi bir düşünce beni bir şey aramaya ve sepete koymaya yönlendiriyor."
"Şeyler satın almak söz konusu olduğunda, kendime hakim olamam. Her rastgele fikir beni çevrimiçi alışveriş yapmaya ve sepete bir şeyler atmaya zorluyor."
Öz kontrol diye bir şey bilmiyorum alışveriş söz konusu olduğunda. Her saçma fikir beni çevrimiçi bir şey satın almaya yönlendiriyor.
Durdurulamaz bir alışveriş bağımlılığım var. Herhangi bir şey beni çevrimiçi gezinmeye ve sepete bir şeyler atmaya itiyor.
Alışveriş konusunda kendimi kontrol edemiyorum. Her önemsiz düşünce beni çevrimiçi alışveriş yapmaya ve sepete bir şeyler atmaya zorluyor.
"PMDD hakkında daha fazla yazı fark etmeye başladım. Ayrıca, çoğumuz için artık sadece 'cehennem haftası' olmadığını ve çoğumuzun yumurtlama etrafında ve dönemlerimizin sonuna doğru hastalandığını da fark ettim."
PMDD hakkında bilgi sahibi olan kadınların sayısının arttığını düşünüyorum.
Artık PMDD'nin sadece 'cehennem haftası' olmadığını ve birçok kadının yumurtlama dönemlerinde ve adet dönemlerinin sonlarına doğru da hastalandığını fark ettim.
Daha fazla kadın PMDD hakkında bilgi edinmeye başladığı için bu konuda daha fazla şey duyuyor gibiyim.
İnsanların PMDD'yi artık daha fazla konuşmaya başladığını ve artık bunun sadece bir 'cehennem haftası' olmadığını fark ediyorum.
Benim gibi PMDD'den etkilenen kadınların aslında oldukça fazla olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Ben Audhd'ım ve zaten birçok duyusal sorunla ve duygusal düzensizlikle uğraşıyorum....Ayrıca yiyecek ve yemekle de büyük ölçüde mücadele ediyorum (Arfid'im var) ve stresli olduğumda veya herhangi bir rahatsızlık hissettiğimde, sadece yemek yiyemiyorum.... Sadece geçen Eylül'de pmdd yaşamaya başladım, ancak diğer sorunlarımı şiddetlendiriyor gibi hissediyorum ve fikirlerimi daha da kötüleştiriyor ve daha da kötüleştiriyor / daha sert ve daha zor kontrol ediyor /"
Aynı zamanda yeme bozukluğu da yaşıyorum ve bu da ruh halimi etkileyen strese yol açıyor.
"Zaten bir sürü duygu düzensizliğim varken, pmdd de eklenince her şey daha karmaşık hale geldi."
"Başka sorunlarla başa çıkmaya çalışırken, şimdi pmdd'nin de üstüne gelmesi çok zor."
Kendimi duygusal olarak dengesiz hissettiğim zamanlarda yemek yemek daha da zorlaşıyor.
"Stresli olduğumda sadece yemek yiyemediğim gibi, pmdd de her şeyi daha da kötüleştiriyor."
Bileklerimde ve ellerimde eklem ağrısı
Bileklerim ve ellerimde çok fazla eklem ağrısı hissediyorum.
"Ellerimde ve bileklerimde ağrı var, hareket etmekte zorlanıyorum."
"Eklem ağrısı, özellikle bileklerimde ve ellerimde çok yoğun."
Bileklerim ve ellerimde eklem ağrılarım beni çok rahatsız ediyor.
Sanki bileklerimde ve ellerimde eklemlerim şişmiş gibi ağrı var.
"Fark ettim ki PMDD'm var, bipolar bozukluk değil ve aralıklı SSRI dozlamayı denememde bu kadar başarılı olduğunu gördükten sonra"
"Benim bipolar bozukluk değil, PMDD olduğunu fark ettim ve aralıklı SSRI dozlama ile bu kadar iyi sonuçlar alınca çok sevindim."
"Bipolar bozukluk değil, PMDD olduğunu anladığımda çok rahatladım ve aralıklı SSRI dozlamasıyla nasıl başarılı sonuçlar aldığımı gördükten sonra iyice mutlu oldum."

Bipolar bozukluk ile karıştırdığım PMDD'min aralıklı SSRI dozlama ile kontrol altına alınabileceğini gördükten sonra çok rahatladım.
"Aralıklı SSRI dozlamasını denediğimde PMDD'm ile başarılı bir şekilde başa çıkabildiğimi gördüm, bipolar bozukluk değilmiş."
"yoğun ağrı, mide bulantısı, titreme, yorgunluk ve baş dönmesi... Bayılacakmış gibi hissediyorum, tüm uzuvlarım uyuşuyormuş gibi hissediyorum ve üstümde bir aceleyle ısınıyorum, sonra dünya bir saniyeliğine biraz kararıyor."
"Vücudumda hissettiğim ağrı dayanılmaz, mide bulantısı beni yerden yere vuruyor, titremeler vücudumu sarsıyor, enerjim sıfırlanmış gibi hissediyorum ve başım dönüyor. Bayılacakmış gibi hissediyorum, tüm vücudum uyuşmuş gibi, sanki bir iğne batırılmış gibi ve bir anda çok fazla sıcaklık hissediyorum, sonrasında gözlerim karararak görme yetim azalıyor."
"Ağrı beni mahvediyor, mide bulantısı beni sürekli kusmak üzere hissettiriyor, tüm vücudum titriyor, halsizliğim artıyor ve başım durmadan dönüyor. Bayılacak gibi hissediyorum, vücudum sanki uyuşmuş, her yerimde iğne batırılmış gibi bir his var ve bir anda aşırı sıcak oluyorum, ardından gözlerim karararak görmemi engelliyor."
"Acı dayanılmaz, midem bulanıyor, vücudum titriyor, enerjim bitmiş gibi hissediyorum ve başım dönüyor. Bayılacakmış gibi hissediyorum, uzuvlarım uyuşmuş ve sanki üzerimde ateş varmış gibi bir sıcaklık hissediyorum, gözlerim de karararak dünya bir anlığına bulanıklaşıyor."
"İçimde bir yangın var, mide bulantısı beni çökertmek üzere, titreyerek üşüyor, enerjim sıfırlanmış gibi hissediyorum ve başım dönüyor. Bayılacak gibi hissediyorum, uzuvlarım uyuşmuş ve vücudum aşırı derecede sıcak, bir an için görüşüm bulanıklaşıyor."
"Ağrılar beni paramparça ediyor, mide bulantısı beni kusturmak üzere, vücudum titriyor, yorgunluğum beni yiyip bitiriyor ve başım dönüyor. Bayılacak gibi hissediyorum, sanki tüm bedenim uyuşmuş gibi ve vücudumda anormal bir sıcaklık hissediyorum, gözlerim kararıyor ve çevrem bulanıklaşıyor."
"Temel olarak PMDD fiziksel semptomlarının tam spektrumunu deneyimlemek (yıkıcı yorgunluk, her zaman kuzgun, akne, beyin sisi)"

"PMDD'nin tüm fiziksel etkilerini - yorgunluk, sinirlilik, sivilce ve beyin sisi - yaşamak zorundasınız."
"PMDD'nin fiziksel belirtileri, yorgunluk, huysuzluk, sivilce ve beyin sisi, her zaman en kötü şekilde ortaya çıkar."
"Adetimden iki hafta önce, tipik olarak normal olmayan en kötü ruh hali değişimlerini alıyorum. Büyük ağlama büyülerim var, normal aktivitelerime olan ilgimi kaybediyorum, bir şapkanın damlasına sinirleniyorum... Dönemimin 3. günündeyim ve ruh hali bilgeyim, hala çöplüklerde hissediyorum. Şu anda sahip olduğum bir iş görüşmesini aşırı düşünüyorum, işte motivasyonsuz hissediyorum ve sadece yalnız bırakılmak istemiyorum."
"Adet döngümün ilk haftası benim için en zor zaman, sanki her şey bana karşıymış gibi hissediyorum."
"Adetten önceki hafta vücudum benimle savaş halinde, enerjim yok, her şey sinir bozucu geliyor."
"Adet dönemim gelmeden önceki günler sanki bir fırtına gibi geçiyor, duygusal iniş çıkışlar, enerjisizlik ve sinirlilik."
"Bu dönem öncesi ruh hali değişimleri dayanılmaz, kendimi kontrol edemediğimi hissediyorum, sanki bir başka insan olmuşum gibi."
"Sanki adetimden önceki hafta benim için bir cehennem gibi geçiyor, her şey çok zor ve yorucu geliyor."

"Çok kötü hissediyorum, kendimi sadece yatağa atıp ağlamak istiyorum."
"Her şeyden bıktım, sadece uzanıp saatlerce ağlamak istiyorum."
"Bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi hiç hatırlamıyorum, sadece yatakta kalıp ağlamak istiyorum."
"İçime bir kara bulut çökmüş gibi, tek istediğim yatıp ağlamak."
"Bu kadar üzgün olduğumu hiç hissetmemiştim, sadece yatakta ağlamak istiyorum."
Kızgın ve üzgünüm ve gecenin bir yarısı ve ortağımla kavga etmek istemiyorum.
"Şu an çok sinirliyim ve üzgünüm, bu saatte tartışmak istemiyorum."
"Gecenin bu saatinde kavga etmek istemiyorum, hem sinirliyim hem de üzgünüm."
"Kızgın olduğumu ve üzgün olduğumu biliyorum, ama bu gece tartışmak istemiyorum."
"Şu anki duygusal halimle tartışmak istemiyorum, hem kızgınım hem de üzgünüm."
"Lütfen şimdi kavga etmeyelim, çok kızgınım ve üzgünüm."
"Kanamaya başladığım gün panik ataklar yaşamaya başladım. Acil servise gittim ve hidroksizin reçete ettim. Hala panik ataklarım vardı, yemek yiyemiyordum, uyuyamıyordum, duş alamıyordum. Adetim yaklaşık 10 gün sürdü ve zayıflatıcı anksiyete yaşıyordum. Adetim sona erdikten sonra, oldukça iyi hissettim ama bu sadece bir hafta gibi sürdü çünkü şimdi kanamam var ve panik ataklar tekrar başladı. Ayrıca 12 kiloyu da kaybettim."
"Fiziksel rahatsızlıklar ve adet döngüsü arasında bir bağlantı hissediyorum, sanki her ay bedenim bana karşı savaşıyor."
"Bu panik ataklar beni tamamen tüketti, hayatımı yaşayamadım, kendimi kaybolmuş hissettim."
"Adet dönemi başladığı andan itibaren hayatım bir kabusa dönüştü, her şey çok zorlaştı."
"Korkuyorum, bu döngü sonsuza dek sürecek gibi, ne zaman bitecek bilmiyorum."
"Bu zayıflatıcı anksiyeteyle yaşamak dayanılmaz, sanki bedenimde bir hapishanede gibiyim."
"Kendimi hayal kırıklığına uğramış ve sefil hissediyorum. Sadece herhangi bir sorumluluktan saklanmak istiyorum....Kocamın benden nefret ettiğine ikna oldum (nedensiz) ve ondan kaçınıyorum....Kendimi gördüğüm her kadınla karşılaştırmayı bırakamıyorum. Midemin üzerinde ağlamak 16 yaşındayken olduğu kadar düz değil. Kendimden nefret etmek... Sadece depresif, güvensiz bir insan kabuğuyum. Sadece karanlık bir odada uzanmak ve aptal makaraları kaydırmak istiyorum, bu yüzden düşünmek istemiyorum."
Kendimi gerçekten işe yaramaz ve çaresiz hissediyorum.
Her şeyden kaçmak ve saklanmak istiyorum.
Kocamın bana karşı soğuk ve ilgisiz olduğunu hissediyorum.
Kendimi diğer kadınlarla sürekli olarak kıyaslıyorum ve her seferinde yetersiz kalıyorum.
"Kendimi değersiz ve çirkin hissediyorum, sadece ortadan kaybolmak istiyorum."
Çok sinirlendim ve sinirlendim... 16'ncı günümde ve sen en iyisi bunun eski dostumuz Pmdd'in geri döndüğüne inan.
"Son zamanlarda kendimi çok yorgun ve sinirli hissediyorum, sanki Pmdd'nin geri döndüğünü hissediyorum."
16. günümde olduğumu düşünürsek bu hissettiğim sinirlilik ve yorgunluk kesinlikle Pmdd'nin belirtileri.
"Bu hafta inanılmaz sinirliyim ve kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum, acaba Pmdd'den mi kaynaklanıyor?"
"Her şey beni sinirlendiriyor ve kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum, bu Pmdd'nin belirtileri olabilir mi?"
"Son günlerde aşırı sinirli ve yorgunum,  sanırım Pmdd'den kaynaklanıyor."
"Kendime defalarca, neden herkesin benim deneyimimle birini işe alacağını ya da herhangi bir yerde, herkes için ne kadar iyi yapabileceğimi sordum. Kendimi doğru kafa boşluğuna sokmak için tipik röportaj sorularını gözden geçirmeye odaklanmakta zorlanıyorum çünkü bana gelen yanıtların hepsi temelde 'emiciyim. Son'a eşittir."
"Kendime defalarca, bu konuda nasıl başarılı olabileceğimi ve işverenleri neden benim seçmem gerektiğini soruyorum."
"Sırf kendim için değil, başkalarının da benimle çalışmak isteyecekleri birini yaratmak için, ne kadar yetenekli olduğumu, ne kadar donanımlı olduğumu düşünerek kendimi motive etmeye çalışıyorum."
"Benim için zor olan şey, kendimi bu işte ne kadar iyi olduğumu, ne kadar değerli olduğumu düşünmeye zorlamak, sürekli olarak bunu sorgulamak."
"Her şeyi yapabileceğimi, her şeyi başarabileceğimi biliyorum ama bunu başkalarına nasıl göstereceğim, nasıl kanıtlayacağım? Bu soru sürekli olarak beni rahatsız ediyor."
"Sürekli olarak kendimi sorgulamaktan, kendimi yetersiz hissetmekten yoruldum. Kendime olan güvenimi nasıl yeniden kazanacağımı bilmiyorum."
Kendimi çirkin hissettirmeyen kıyafetler giymeyi göze almak istiyorum. Kendimi daha iyi hissetmek için kötü bir günde çevrimiçi olarak küçük bir şey satın almayı göze almak istiyorum.
Kendimi daha iyi hissetmem için dışarı çıkıp biraz zaman geçirmek istiyorum.
"İhtiyacım olduğunda, kendimi daha iyi hissetmek için bir arkadaşımı arayabilirim."
Biraz müzik dinlemek ve dünyanın tüm sorunlarını unutmak istiyorum.
Kendimi daha iyi hissetmek için bir film izlemek istiyorum.
Rahatlamak ve sorunlarıma uzaktan bakmak istiyorum.
"Ayrıca kendimi tımar etmiyorum, örneğin saçımı fırçalamıyorum veya elbisemi / hiç iyi görünmek istemiyorum. Hijyenim hakkında o kadar da farkında değilim ve çamaşırlarım beni canlı canlı gömecek bir görev gibi geliyor."
"Kendime bakmak için hiç çaba sarf etmiyorum, tıraş olmuyorum veya dişlerimi fırçalamıyorum. Sadece olduğum gibiyim, bu durumla barıştım."
"Önemsemiyorum, hayatımda ne olduğuna bakmıyorum. Çalışmıyorum, evimi temizlemiyorum, hatta dişlerimi bile fırçalamıyorum."
Bana göre görünüm çok önemli değil. Kendime bakmakla uğraşmıyorum. Aslında bakımımdan hiç memnun değilim.
"Benim için önemli olan dış görünüş değil, içsel değerlerdir. Kendimi tımar etmem, kendime zaman ayırmam, kendime özen göstermem gerekmiyor."
"Benim için görünüm ve temizlik önemsiz. Saçımı, dişlerimi fırçalamıyorum. Kendime bakmak gibi bir derdim yok."
"Onun atışlarında, onu saldırgan buldum ve ağladım."
"O kadar sert vuruyordu ki, kendimi savunmasız hissettim ve ağlamaya başladım."
Ağır vuruşlarının her birinde saldırgan olduğunu hissettim ve gözyaşlarım sel oldu.
"Vuruşları o kadar güçlüydü ki, sanki bana saldırıyor gibi hissettim ve kendimi tutamayıp ağladım."
"O an, onun öfkesini ve şiddetini hissettim ve gözyaşlarım durmak bilmedi."
"Atışlarının sertliği, onun saldırganlığını gösteriyordu ve ben de kendimi tutamayıp ağlamaya başladım."
"Pmdd'ye hitap etmek için iyi bir iş seçeneği olabilecek bir şeye takıldım. Çok endişeliyim ve her zaman yapmak istediğim herhangi bir şeyin, pmdd'min şu ya da bu şekilde yoluna çıkacağından şüphem var... Enerji beyin sisi yok, arzu yok vb."
"PMDD'min beni iş aramaktan alıkoyduğunu hissediyorum, sürekli olarak endişeleniyorum ve ilgimi çekebilecek hiçbir şeyin mümkün olduğunu düşünmüyorum."
"Bu PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini düşünmek bile beni yorgun hissettiriyor. Enerjim yok, beyin sisi ve motivasyon eksikliği yaşıyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Sanki PMDD'nin sürekli olarak benimle uğraştığını hissediyorum ve bu yüzden herhangi bir işe başlamaktan çekiniyorum. Bu belirtilerle, herhangi bir şeyi başarmak neredeyse imkansız."
Her zaman yapabileceğim şeylerden endişeleniyorum ve PMDD'nin beni her zaman aşağı çektiğini hissediyorum. Sanki bir yokuş yukarı koşuyorum ama bir yere varamıyorum.
PMDD'nin beni iş hayatında ne kadar etkileyeceğini düşünmek beni gerçekten korkutuyor. Enerjimin ve motivasyonumun beni aşağı çekmesinden korkuyorum.
"Yıllardır yardım almaya çalışıyorum... doktorum sikimde bile değil... hiçbir şey almadım, ne anlamı var ki?"
"Uzun zamandır yardım arıyorum, ama doktorum beni umursamıyor bile... hiçbir fayda göremedim, ne işe yarar ki?"
"Yıllarca yardım almak için uğraştım, ama doktorum duymazdan geldi... hiç sonuç alamadım, ne anlamı var?"
"Yardım almak için çabalıyorum ama doktorum umursamıyor... hiçbir şey değişmedi, neden uğraşıyorum ki?"
"Doktorumdan yardım bekliyorum ama o hiç ilgilenmiyor... hiçbir şey yoluna girmedi, bu çabaların ne anlamı var?"
"Yıllarca doktoruma ulaşmaya çalıştım, ama o hiç umursamadı... hiçbir faydasını görmedim, boşuna mı uğraşıyorum?"
Önümüzdeki 7-10 gün boyunca dehşete düştüm. İlişkimde luteal fazım boyunca çok fazla soruna neden oluyorum ve bunun kötü bir şey olacağından endişeliyim.
"Korkuyorum, önümüzdeki hafta ya da on gün içinde neler olacağını bilmiyorum. İlişkimde her şey çok karışık ve kötüye gideceğinden korkuyorum."
Son birkaç gündür kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum. İlişkimde her şey yolunda değil ve bu durumun daha da kötüye gideceğinden endişeleniyorum.
Bu günlerde hep kötü bir şey olacağından korkuyorum. İlişkimde her şey çok stresli ve bunun kötü sonuçlanacağından endişeleniyorum.
Önümüzdeki günler çok zor geçecek gibi hissediyorum. İlişkimde her şey çok karmaşık ve kötüye gideceğinden korkuyorum.

"Ben doğrudan gitmek eğilimindedir, 'Eh, beni becermek, Ben lanet hayatım buna bağlı gibi çalışıyorum, ve ben yeterince ileriye arabayı hareket etmedi çünkü şimdi sen de benden nefret"".... Ben gerçekten atlamak- Ben kötüyüm, nefret, kötülük, yanlış.... Ben değiştirmek için mücadele.... Ben başarısız olmak gibi hissediyorum.... Ben sürekli insanları rahatsız etmek ya da kötü olmak için değil gibi hissediyorum."
"Ben her şeyi çok fazla ciddiye alıyorum ve hep kötü hissediyorum, sanki sürekli bir hata yapıyorum."
"Her zaman kontrolümde olan bir şey olması için mücadele ediyorum, sanki her şey yanlış gidiyor."
"Aynı şekilde başa çıkmak için her zaman bir yol bulmaya çalışıyorum, 'Gerçekten nefes almalıyım, çünkü hepimizi kendimize karşı çok zorluyoruz'."
"Benimle ilgilenilmesini istemiyorum, insanlar beni becermeye çalıştıklarında, sadece kaçıp gitmek istiyorum."
"Doğru olanı yapmaya çalışıyorum, bu şekilde değilmiş gibi hissediyorum ama hep kendimi daha iyi olmaya zorluyorum."
Pmdd sırasında bağırıp çağırmaktan ve tüm problemlerden bıktım usandım.
"Bu dönemde yaşadığım her şeyden, özellikle de bu sürekli bağırıp çağırmaktan yoruldum."
Pmdd'nin bana yaşattığı bu öfke patlamaları ve problemlerle başa çıkamıyorum.
"Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşamak, bağırıp çağırmak, problemlerle boğuşmak... Çok yorucu."
"Benimle uğraşmak zorunda kalmaktan, sürekli bağırıp çağırmaktan ve tüm problemleri çözmekten yoruldum."
"Bu dönemde yaşadığım tüm zorluklar, bağırıp çağırmaktan, problemlerle boğuşmaktan bıktırdı beni."
"Pes etmek istiyorum, tekrar ortağımla kavga etmeye geri döndüm, bu zor."
"Yeter artık, sürekli aynı şeylerden kavga ediyoruz, bezdim."
"Her gün tartışıyoruz, bu ilişki gerçekten çok zor."
"Bir türlü anlaşamıyoruz, sanki hep kavga etmeye mahkummuşuz gibi."
"Bu durum beni çok yoruyor, tekrar aynı kavgalara geri dönmek istemiyorum."
"Her şey çok karışık, ilişkinin düzeleceğine inanmıyorum."
Bu yüzden çok hasta olmak zorundayım. Her ay bu yüzden en az 4 gün ara.
"İşler çok yoğun, her ay mutlaka birkaç gün izin almak zorundayım."
"Yorgunluktan kırılıyorum, biraz dinlenmem gerek, her ay birkaç gün izin alırım."
"Çok yorucu bir iş, her ay en az 4 gün izin almam şart."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, doktorun tavsiyesi üzerine her ay en az 4 gün dinlenmem gerekiyor."
Sağlığımı korumak için her ay en az 4 gün izin almam gerekiyor.
Ses hassasiyeti gerçekten kötü
Ses kalitesi çok kötü.
Ses çok boğuk geliyor.
Ses netliği gerçekten çok düşük.
Bu ses sistemi çok kötü.
Bu hoparlörler ses kalitesine hiç dikkat etmemiş.
Yaptığı hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyormuş gibi hissediyor.
Onun yaptıkları artık eskisi gibi mutluluk vermiyor.
Hiçbir şey beni onun yaptığı kadar mutlu etmiyor.
Yaptığı her şey beni hayal kırıklığına uğratıyor.
Artık onun yaptığı hiçbir şeyde tatmin bulamıyorum.
O eskisi gibi beni mutlu etmiyor.

"Kendimi berbat hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Bugün kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, her şey beni üzüyor."
"Yorgun hissediyorum, uykum geliyor, konsantre olamıyorum."
"Hastaymışım gibi hissediyorum, başım dönüyor, vücudum ağrıyor."
"Kendimi içeride kalmaya zorluyorum, dışarı çıkmak için enerjim yok."
"Artık kendimle savaşmıyorum, hayatımı korkunç dönemler ve PMDD bölümleri etrafında planlama konusunda sürekli bir endişem yok. Sabah kalkıyorum ve sadece... var. Dürüst olmak gerekirse, vahşi bir tür. Post op, yaklaşık bir ay süren 'yüksek' bir deneyim yaşadım. Beynimdeki ani değişimin etrafındaki Euphoria - sadece PMDD'yi değil, günlük kaygımı da normal bir 6/10'dan 0-2/10'a taşıdım. Bu tamamen beklenmedik ve sürekli olarak sürpriz oldu."
"PMDD'nin hayatımı nasıl kontrol ettiğini düşünmek bile beni rahatsız ediyordu, şimdi ise onunla mücadele etmiyorum, sadece yaşıyorum."
"Korkunç dönemler ve PMDD belirtileri artık benim için bir engel değil, hayatımı onlara göre şekillendirmiyorum."
"Eskiden her sabah uyandığımda PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkileyeceği konusunda endişeleniyordum, şimdi ise sadece yaşamaya odaklanıyorum."
"İlaçlar sayesinde PMDD'nin benim için bir sorun olmaktan çıktığını söyleyebilirim, artık hayatımı onun etrafında planlamıyorum."
"Artık PMDD'nin beni kontrol etmesine izin vermiyorum, kendimi onun pençesinden kurtardım ve özgürlüğümü geri kazandım."
"Bu ayki 4. günüm gibi gözlerimi açıp panik atak, çığlık, üzgün ve düzgün düşünemiyorum."
"Bugün de aynı hislerle uyandım, her şey çok yoğun, sanki üzerime bir ağırlık bindirilmiş gibi."
"Her sabah aynı senaryo, uyandığımda kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum."
"Geçen ayki gibi bu ay da aynı korkuyla başladım, nefes alamıyorum, her şey çok ürkütücü."
"Bu hislerle yaşamak çok zor, sanki sürekli bir fırtınanın içindeyim."
"Yatağımı terk edemiyorum, sanki tüm enerjim tükenmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Kolay gitmekten, olumlu, temiz ve kendimle ve evimde gurur duyuyorum... kelimenin tam anlamıyla çalışamıyorum ve evim bir karmaşaya dönüşüyor... bir bardak su içmek veya duş almak gibi basit görevler bir dağa dönüşüyor ve kimsenin nasıl çalıştığını veya başa çıktığını anlayamıyorum. Tek istediğim yatakta kalmak ve dünyadan saklanmak. Herhangi bir şey yapmak, başımın hemen üstünde kalın kumla mücadele ediyormuşum gibi hissettiriyor ama yakında altına girebilirim..."
"Normalde hayatımı düzenli tutmayı severim, ama şu anda kendimi çok yorgun ve bunalmış hissediyorum."
"Her şey yolunda giderken, kendimi motive ve enerjik hissediyorum ama şu anda her şey çok ağır geliyor."
"İstediğim tek şey her şeyi bırakıp dinlenmek, ama bunun mümkün olacağından emin değilim."
Duygularımın beni çok yorduğunu ve işlevsiz hissettirdiğini hissediyorum.
"Bu yoğunluğun içinden nasıl çıkacağımı bilmiyorum, çünkü hiçbir şey yapmak için enerjim yok."
"3 yıl önce üniversiteye ilk başladığımda, neredeyse hemen panik atak geçirmeye başladım ve son derece intihara meyilli oldum. Annem bu olayların ne zaman olacağını izlemeye başladı ve esas olarak yumurtlama sırasında dönemimden birkaç gün önce veya döngümün ortasındaydı."
"Üniversiteye ilk başladığımda yaşanan panik ataklarım ve intihar düşüncelerim, dönem döngümle ilgili olduğunu fark ettikten sonra beni çok korkuttu."

"Üniversitedeki ilk yılım, şiddetli panik ataklarla ve intihar düşünceleriyle dolu geçti. Annem, bu durumun döngümün ortasında veya yumurtlamadan birkaç gün önce yaşandığını fark etti."
"Panik ataklar ve intihar düşünceleri üniversiteye başladığımdan beri devam ediyordu, annem bu olayların çoğunlukla döngümün ortasında veya yumurtlamadan birkaç gün önce olduğunu gözlemledi."
"Üniversiteye başlar başlamaz, şiddetli panik ataklar ve intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşmaya başladım. Annem, bu olayların genellikle döngümün ortasında veya yumurtlamadan birkaç gün önce yaşandığını fark etti."
"Bu tanıyı birkaç yıldır biliyorum, ancak hareketli bir kale direği gibi hissettirdiğinde onunla yaşamayı nasıl öğrenebileceğimi bilmiyorum. Beyin sisi, kelimenin tam anlamıyla çalışamıyorum, bazen amaçsızca dolaşıyorum, bu haftanın başlarında, ayakkabısız evimden uzaklaştım. İşyerindeki görevlerimi tamamlayamıyorum. Evde, odalardan geçen bir kargaşa gibi geliyor."
"Bu tanı, hayatımı tamamen altüst etti ve bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum."
Hayatımda sürekli bir kaos var ve bu kaosun içinde kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum.
"Bu hastalıkla yaşamanın ne demek olduğunu gerçekten anlamıyorum, sanki her şey kontrolümden çıkmış gibi."
"Bir an için bile normale dönmeyi umuyordum, ancak durum gittikçe kötüleşiyor ve gelecekten korkmaya başladım."
"Zihnim bulanık, vücudum yorgun ve ben bu hastalığın beni adım adım nasıl yuttuğunu izliyorum."

Keşke PMDD ile en az bir tane daha IRL'yi tanısaydım. Bu konuda konuşabilmem için benimle gerçekten akraba olan bir kadın.
Keşke PMDD ile ilgili bu kadar yalnız olmadığımı bilseydim.
PMDD'yi yaşayan biriyle konuşmak için can atıyorum.
Bu konuda benimle konuşabileceğim başka bir kadın var mı?
PMDD'yi yaşadığını bilen başka bir kadını tanımak çok yardımcı olurdu.
Sadece PMDD'den bahsedebileceğim birine sahip olmak çok şey ifade ederdi.

"Bir erkeğe duygusal olarak kırılgan tarafımı göstermekten korkuyorum, özellikle PMDD ile mücadele ettiğimi söylemekten. Beni yargılayacağını düşünüyorum."
Kendimi çok kırılgan hissettiğim için ilişkide olduğum erkeğe PMDD ile ilgili yaşadıklarımı anlatamadım. Beni anlayacağına inanmıyorum.
Korkunç PMDD'nin derinliklerindeyim (...) ve bu sabahki adderall'ımı almama rağmen yönetici işlev bozukluğuyla uğraşıyorum. Son birkaç haftadır çıplak minimumu yapmak ve bunun gibi bokları görmek beni çok rahatsız ediyor.
PMDD'nin beni tam anlamıyla yuttuğunu hissediyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.
"Bu günlerde işlevsellikten tamamen yoksunum, adderall bile işe yaramıyor."
Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ve sadece yaşamaya çalışıyorum.
"İşleri halledebilmek için kendimi zorluyorum, ama beyin buğusu beni bitirdi."
"Son haftalarda kendimi sürekli olarak mücadele ederken buluyorum, bu da beni çok yordu."
"Bazı luteal fazlarda, gerginlik baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi, baş vızıltısı, gün boyunca sürekli panik ataklar, aşırı ve aşırı ve hafif yorucu bir şey yaptıktan sonra aşırı yorgunluk ve egzersiz sonrası halsizlik gibi fiziksel semptomlara neden olduğu noktaya aşırı endişe duyuyorum."
"Luteal fazda, endişe duygusu o kadar yoğun ki, baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi ve halsizlik gibi fiziksel belirtilerle kendini gösteriyor."
"Aşırı endişelerim, luteal fazda vücudumu etkileyerek baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi ve yorgunluk gibi fiziksel belirtilere yol açıyor."
"Her luteal fazda aynı senaryo tekrarlıyor: aşırı endişe, baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi, halsizlik... Bunlar beni gerçekten yıpratıyor."
"Luteal fazda yaşadığım aşırı endişe, fiziksel semptomlara dönüşüyor. Baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi, halsizlik... sanki bedenim beni dinlemiyor."
"Luteal fazda yaşadığım endişe, sadece ruhsal değil, aynı zamanda fiziksel de. Baş ağrısı, baş dönmesi, halsizlik... bedenim bana alarm veriyor."
"Çok sönmüş, yenilmiş hissediyorum... Pes etmek istiyorum... Gerçekten depresyonda hissediyorum, kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum, gerçekten bir şey yapmak istemiyorum... Bu korkunç kaygı ve üzüntüyü hissettim... Adetimden önce her zaman tartışmacı ve öfkeli olduğumu hissediyorum ve bunu durduramıyorum ve 5 dakika sonra pişmanım... yumurtalıklarım bugün acıyordu..."
"Bugün kendimi çok yorgun ve isteksiz hissediyorum, sanki hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Sanki bir şeyler beni içten içe kemiriyor, hiçbir şey beni mutlu etmiyor."
"Çok mutsuz ve umutsuz hissediyorum, sanki hayattan zevk alamıyorum."
"Fiziksel ve duygusal olarak çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki vücudum benim değilmiş gibi."
"Kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, sanki öfkem beni ele geçirmiş gibi."
Suuuuper asabileşiyorum... sonra herkes benden nefret ediyormuş gibi hissetmeye başlıyorum.
"Sürekli sinirleniyorum, sonra da herkesin bana karşı kötü olduğunu düşünüyorum."
"Bir anda çok sinirlendiğimde, sanki herkes benden nefret ediyormuş gibi hissediyorum."
Çok çabuk sinirleniyorum ve bu yüzden herkes beni sevmiyor gibi hissediyorum.
"Asabi olduğum zaman, herkes benden nefret ediyor gibi hissediyorum."
Sinirlendiğimde herkes benimle kötü davranıyormuş gibi hissediyorum.
"Korkunç anksiyete, depresyon, ilişkimi sorgulamak, değerim, seçimlerim, çocukluk travmam beni rahatsız ediyor, kendime zarar vermeyi düşünüyorum, bunalmış hissediyorum ve etrafta olmak korkunç derecede tatsız. Fiziksel acı en az 2 gün zayıflatıyor."
"Kendimi tamamen çaresiz, kayıp ve aşırı derecede yorgun hissediyorum."
"Hayatın tüm yükü omuzlarımda, hiçbir yere gitme gücüm yok."
"Günden güne daha da kötüye gidiyorum, bir çıkış yolu göremiyorum."
"Her şey beni bunaltıyor, hiç durmayan bir karamsarlık dalgası içindeyim."
"Bu kötü hisler bir türlü geçmiyor, beni tamamen tüketti, çaresizliğe sürükleniyorum."
"Bu ay kötü bir parlama yaşadım. (fiziksel olarak zayıf, ateşli, hassas göğüsler, dissosiyatif, süper endişeli, depresif ruh hali, kendine zarar verme düşünceleri vb.), Hala zaman zaman ateşli hissediyorum, düşük ruh hali ile yüksek kaygı ve ani yorgunluk yaşıyorum."
"Bu ay gerçekten çok kötü hissettim, sanki vücudum beni terk etmek üzereymiş gibi."
"Kendimi çok yorgun ve halsiz hissediyorum, sanki vücudumda enerji kalmamış gibi."
"Duygusal olarak çok çalkantılı bir dönemdeydim, sanki her an bir fırtınaya yakalanıyormuş gibi."
"Bu ay çok hassas ve savunmasız hissettim, sanki her şey beni kolayca incitebiliyormuş gibi."
"Bir türlü kendimi toparlayamıyorum, sanki bir türlü uyanamamışım gibi."
"Pmdd cehennem haftalarım boyunca sınır kişilik bozukluğundan muzdaripim (bundan sonra, bununla ilgili hiçbir sorunum yok). Şiddetli kronik mdd ve şiddetli kronik gad'dan muzdaripim. Fiziksel olarak çok acı çekiyorum, sadece ayakta durmak veya hayatta olmak vücudumun her santimine zarar veriyor."
"Benim için her şey çok zor, haftada birkaç gün kendim değilim. "
"Fiziksel ve ruhsal olarak çok kötü durumdayım, bu durumlar hayatımı çok zorlaştırıyor."
Sürekli ağrı ve sıkıntı içindeyim. Yaşamak bile çok zor. 
"Sanki her şey üstüme üstüme geliyor, her şey çok yorucu."
"Ben sadece bir insanım,  bu durumlarla başa çıkmak çok zor."
PMDD'nin bir sakatlık olarak sınıflandırılabileceğini ve FMLA'ya hak kazanabileceğini gördüm. Ama gerçekten pasif agresif olduğu için patronumdan yankılar bekliyorum. İşyerinde ruh sağlığı günlerine izin veriliyor ancak yargısız gelmiyor. PMDD nedeniyle işi özlüyor musunuz?
Patronumun PMDD'yi bir bahane olarak göreceğinden ve benim hakkımda ters yorumlar yapacağından korkuyorum.
"İşyerinde ruh sağlığı konusunda rahat bir ortam olsa da, bazı meslektaşlarımın hala bu durumu anlayamayacağından endişeleniyorum."
FMLA hakkımı kullanmanın bana işyerinde bir dezavantaj sağlayabileceğinden korkuyorum.
"PMDD'nin benim performansımı etkilediğini kabul etmek zor, çünkü insanların bunu bir zayıflık olarak algılayabileceğinden korkuyorum."
"Patronumun PMDD'mi ciddiye almasını ve beni desteklemesini umuyorum, ancak bu konuda iyimser değilim."
"Bir dizi semptom yaşadım anksiyete depresyon panik atak paranoya..... her zaman luteal faz sırasında çok daha kötü.... Panik atak geçirmeme ve mükemmel güzel hayatımı patlatmama yol açan kontrol edilemez müdahaleci düşünceler paranoyam var.... Kafamdaki şeyleri uydurduğumdan o kadar şüphelendiğim paranoyak düşünceleri durduramıyorum, sonra onu suçluyorum.... Biliyorum, derinlerde saçmalıyorum ama ağzımdan çıkan düşünceleri ve şeyleri kontrol edemiyorum."
"Luteal fazda yaşadığım yoğun kaygı, depresyon, panik atak ve paranoya, kontrolsüz, işgalci düşüncelerle dolu bir döngüye giriyor ve tüm hayatımı alt üst edebiliyor."
"Bir süredir şiddetli kaygı, depresyon ve panik atak yaşıyorum. Özellikle luteal faz sırasında daha da kötüleşiyor, paranoyamın kontrol edilemez düşüncelerle artması ve hayatımı mahvetme korkusuyla doluyorum."
"Luteal faz sırasında yaşanan bu ani kaygı, depresyon, panik atak ve paranoya beni tüketiyor. Kontrol edilemez düşüncelerle boğuşuyorum, sanki aklım kendi kendine bir film oynatıyor ve ben sadece izleyiciyim."
"Kontrol edemediğim işgalci düşüncelerle, paranoyayla boğuşuyorum, panik atağa neden oluyor ve hayatımı mahvetme korkusu içindeyim. Özellikle luteal fazda bu belirtiler daha da yoğunlaşıyor."
"Kaygı, depresyon ve panik ataklar luteal fazda şiddetleniyor. Paranoya ve kontrolsüz düşünceler beni ele geçiriyor, kendimi gerçeğe bağlamakta zorlanıyorum. Aklımın kendi kendine bir hayat yaşadığını, beni kontrol ettiğini hissediyorum."
"Rahmim döngümün son 7 günü boyunca dolu hissediyor... Yıkanmış, ağır, yorgun, hassas hissediyorum. Rahmimde merkezlenmiş. Diğer tüm duygularım göğsümde ve karnımda."
"Adet döneminin son 7 gününde, rahminim ağır ve şişmiş hissetmesi nedeniyle bedenimde bir ağırlık ve yorgunluk hissediyorum."
"Rahmimdeki doluluk ve ağırlık, bedenimin her yerinde hissedilen bir hassasiyete neden oluyor."
"Sanki bedenimin merkezi rahmimmiş gibi hissediyorum, tüm duygularım orada toplanmış gibi."
"Göğsümde ve karnımda hissettiğim duygular, rahmimdeki yoğunluğa eşlik ediyor."
Adet döneminin bu evresinde bedenimde hissettiğim duygusal yoğunluğu anlamakta zorlanıyorum.
luteal sırasında sağlıklı gıdalar yediğimde depresyon ve anksiyete daha da kötüleşir. Kazanamayacağımı hissettim. luteal karbonhidrat ve yağ isteklerini verip daha fazla kilo mu alıyorum yoksa tavuk ve sebze yiyorum ve ciddi bir fikir yürütme ile zihinsel bir kırılma riski taşıyor muyum?
"Luteal fazda sağlıklı beslenmeye çalıştığımda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, bir yandan aşırı yeme isteğiyle boğuşuyorum, diğer yandan da zihinsel sağlığım tehlikeye giriyor."
"Luteal fazda her zaman bir ikilemle karşı karşıya kalıyorum: Ya istediğim gibi yiyeceğim ve kendimi kötü hissedeceğim, ya da sağlıklı besleneceğim ve ruh halim daha da kötüleşecek."
"Bu luteal faz benim için bir cehennem, her şey daha zor, kendime hakim olamıyorum, ya yiyecek isteklerine yenik düşüyorum ya da zihinsel sağlığım bozuluyor."
"Luteal fazda her zaman aynı mücadeleyi veriyorum, sağlıklı beslenmeye çalışıyorum ama kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, o yüzden de aşırı yemeye başlıyorum ve bu da ruh halimi daha da kötüleştiriyor."
"Luteal fazda kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum, ne yiyeceğimi bilmiyorum, her seçeneğin bir dezavantajı var, ya kilo alacağım ya da zihinsel sağlığım bozulacak."
"Aşırı duygusallaştığımda, kızgın ya da üzgün olsun, daha ağır lekelenmeye ya da kanamaya başlarım. Döngümün sonunda olmasa bile, fark edip kramp atarım."
"Duygusal olarak yoğunlaştığımda, ne olursa olsun, kendimi fiziksel olarak kötü hissediyorum, sanki bir hastalık geçirir gibi."
"Aşırı duygusal olduğumda, mutluluk bile olsa, vücudum bunu acı çekerek gösteriyor, kramplar başlıyor."
"Kendimi çok yoğun hissettiğim zamanlar, vücudum da buna tepki veriyor, sanki kendimi cezalandırıyormuş gibi."
"Güçlü duygular, ister olumlu ister olumsuz olsun, bedenimde bir rahatsızlığa dönüşüyor, bu beni korkutuyor."
"Duygularımı kontrol edemediğimde, bedenimde hissettiğim ağrı, sanki bir ceza gibi."
Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum! Genellikle işyerinde bana selfie gönderdiğinde çok seviyorum. Ama bu hafta bunu yaptığında REPULSED
Bu haftaki fotoğrafı gördüğümde gerçekten iğrendim.
"Selfie göndermekten vazgeç lütfen, bu sefer hiç hoşuma gitmedi."
"Bunu neden bana gönderdin anlayamıyorum, çok kötü görünüyorum."
Bu fotoğrafı görünce midem bulandı.
"Senden bir daha böyle bir şey beklemiyordum, çok kötü hissettim."
"Birkaç yıldır PMDD teşhisi kondu ve henüz başarılı bir şey bulamadım. Migrenlerim nedeniyle östrojenli bir hap alamıyorum. Şu anda Prozac'tayım ve geçmişte daha önce oldum, ancak özellikle bölüm kötüleştiğinde bir şey yapıp yapmadığını söylemek zor."
"PMDD teşhisiyle mücadele ediyorum ve doğru tedaviyi bulmak gerçekten zor, özellikle migrenlerim nedeniyle östrojenli ilaçları deneyemiyorum."
Yıllardır PMDD ile yaşıyorum ama hala tam anlamıyla rahatlama sağlayan bir çözüm bulamadım. Prozac'ı deniyorum ama emin değilim ki PMS belirtilerimi kontrol altında tutabilsin.
"Migrenlerim nedeniyle östrojenli ilaçlar benim için bir seçenek değil, bu yüzden PMDD'yi yönetmek için başka seçenekler arıyorum. Şu anda Prozac kullanıyorum ama henüz tam olarak işe yarıyor mu bilmiyorum."
Östrojenli ilaçlar migrenlerimi tetiklediği için PMDD için etkili bir tedavi bulmak çok zor. Prozac'ı denedim ama henüz bir fark yaratıp yaratmadığını göremiyorum.
PMDD'nin belirtilerini kontrol altına almak için mücadele ediyorum ve migrenlerim nedeniyle seçeneklerim sınırlı. Prozac'ı kullanıyorum ama henüz uzun vadeli bir çözüm olup olmadığını bilmiyorum.
Hayatta kendimi çok depresif hissettim. Sonra annemle kavga ettim ve ona küstüm ve berbat hissediyorum. İdeal olarak konuşmak istediğim erkek arkadaşım şu anda da kullanılamıyor ve sadece önümüzdeki birkaç yıl boyunca yastığıma ağlamak istiyorum. Çok yalnız ve sefil hissediyorum.
Hayatımda gerçekten kötü bir dönemden geçiyorum. Her şey üst üste geliyor ve kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum.
Annemle kavga ettikten sonra kendimi berbat hissediyorum. Şu anda kimseyle konuşmak istemiyorum.
Erkek arkadaşımla konuşamamak beni daha da kötü hissettiriyor. Kendimi çok çaresiz ve yalnız hissediyorum.
Hayatımda hiçbir şey yolunda gitmiyor. Sadece ağlamak ve her şeyin geçmesini beklemek istiyorum.
"Bu kadar kötü hissettiğimi hiç düşünmemiştim. İşte bu yüzden insanlara içimi dökmem gerek, ama kimseye güvenemiyorum."
Zihnim ve vücudum beni bir mahkum gibi hissettiriyor. Kontrol edilemez ağlıyorum; motive olmadım ve hareket edemiyorum - bir Pmdd bölümü sırasında olduğu gibi ama x 2. Kendi işlevsiz zihnimde / vücudumda kapana kısılmış hissediyorum. Kendimi bile temize çıkaramıyorum. insanları gör.
"Vücudum ve zihnim beni tamamen kontrol altına almış gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şekilde hareket edemiyorum."
"Adeta kendi bedenimde ve zihnimde esir tutuluyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak için gücüm yok."
"Motivasyonum tamamen yok, enerjim tükenmiş gibi hissediyorum ve kendimi hareket ettiremiyorum."
"Bu hissi tarif etmenin bir yolu yok, sanki bir hapisteyim ve anahtarları bulmak için hiçbir çabam yok."
"İnsanlarla iletişim kurmayı bile başaramıyorum, kendimi dış dünyadan tamamen kopmuş hissediyorum."
extream sıcak basmalar veya ürpermeler
Aşırı sıcak basmaları ve titremeler yaşadım.
Vücudumun sıcak olup olmadığına karar veremediğim için aşırı sıcak basmaları veya ürpermeler hissettim.
"Son zamanlarda sık sık aşırı sıcak basmaları veya ürpermeler yaşıyorum, bu çok rahatsız edici."
"Aşırı sıcak basmaları ve titremeler, vücudumun hormonal değişikliklere tepki verdiğini gösteriyor olabilir."
"Aşırı sıcak basmaları ve ürpermeler, stresin fiziksel belirtileri olabilir."
"Geçen hafta onu bir PMDD bölümüne soktum. Eğlenceli değildi. Ve bu yüzden ona yer verdim ve sorumluluk aldım ve içtenlikle özür diledim. Bu gece, sonunda acımasızlığından bıktım. Sonunda hayal edilmediğini fark ettim."
"Geçen hafta ona çok kötü davranmıştım, sanki hiç bir şey hissetmiyormuşum gibi. Şimdi pişmanlık duyuyorum ve özür diliyorum."
"Kendimi kontrol edemedim, onu çok incittim. Ama artık anlayabiliyorum, affetmeyi öğrenmem gerek."
"Onu gerçekten üzdüğümü fark ediyorum, kendimi bağışlayamıyorum. Umarım bir gün affeder."
"Bütün bunlar benim hatam, düşüncesizce davrandım. Gerçekten pişmanım ve bunu telafi etmek istiyorum."
Onu ne kadar kırdığımı şimdi daha iyi anlıyorum. İnşallah bir gün bana güvenmeyi tekrar öğrenebilir.
"HRT'den önce şiddetli pmdd semptomlarım vardı, ancak minimal dönem krampları, kötü eklem ağrısı ve rahatsız olurdum, ancak dönemimdeyken ağrı kesici ilaçlar kullanmak zorunda kalmadım. HRT'ye başlar başlamaz, dönem ağrım kesinlikle dayanılmazdı, daha önce hiç bu seviyedeki dönem ağrısını yaşamadım, şimdi mevcut en güçlü ağrı kesicileri kullanmak zorundayım ve hala acı çekiyorum."
"HRT'ye başlamadan önce dönem ağrılarım hafifti, ancak HRT'ye başladıktan sonra çok şiddetli hale geldi."
"HRT'den önce dönem ağrılarım sadece rahatsız ediciydi, ancak şimdi son derece dayanılmaz."
"HRT'den önce ağrı kesici kullanmama gerek kalmazdı, ancak şimdi en güçlü ağrı kesicileri bile yetersiz geliyor."
"HRT'ye başlamadan önce dönem ağrılarım hafifti, ancak şimdi çok şiddetli ve sürekli ağrı çekiyorum."
"HRT'den önce dönem ağrılarıma katlanabiliyordum, ancak şimdi dayanılmaz hale geldi ve bu ağrıyı hafifletmek için en güçlü ağrı kesicileri kullanıyorum."
Düşünceleriniz gerçek hissetseler bile size ait değildir... Yaz ve dönemin başladıktan sonra nasıl hissettiğini gör...
"Düşüncelerinizi kontrol edemezsiniz, ama eylemlerinizi kontrol edebilirsiniz."
"Duygularınız sizi yönlendirmesine izin vermeyin, kendi kararlarınızı siz verin."
"Sizi zorlayan düşünceleriniz, sizi tanımlayan şeyler değil."
"Bir adım geri çekilin ve düşüncelerinizi gözlemleyin, onlara kapılmayın."
"Hissettiklerinizi dışa vurmak, kendinizi anlamak için en iyi yol olabilir."
"Oldukça kötü olan bir haftam var ve çoğunlukla bu hafta boşluğa ihtiyacım var, ama partnerim bana yeterince yer vermiyor, aynı zamanda yanak şakalarında dil yapıyor ya da alaycı her iki şey de benim için tetikleniyor ve ona bu özel hafta yapmamasını söyledim, aynı zamanda kavgalarımızdan Ptsd'ye sahip olduğu için bir fahişe olacağımı ve beni daha da perişan eden çağrılarıma cevap vermeyeceğini düşünüyorum."
"Kötü bir hafta geçirdim ve sadece biraz yalnız kalmaya ihtiyacım var, ancak partnerim bana bunu vermiyor, ayrıca benim için tetikleyici olan alaycı sözler de söylemeye devam ediyor, bu konuyu zaten konuştuk ve bu hafta bunu yapmamasını rica ettim."
"Bu hafta gerçekten zorlu geçti ve biraz kendime zaman ayırmaya ihtiyacım var, ama partnerim beni yalnız bırakmak istemiyor, üstüne üstlük beni tetikleyen şeyler de söylüyor ve bu konuyu zaten konuşmuştuk."
"Son zamanlarda oldukça kötü hissediyorum ve kendimi toparlamak için biraz zamana ihtiyacım var, ancak partnerim bana bu zamanı vermiyor ve üstüne üstlük beni rahatsız eden sözler de söylüyor."
"Bu hafta çok kötü geçti ve yalnız kalıp düşünmeye ihtiyacım var, ancak partnerim bana bunu vermiyor ve üstüne üstlük beni kızdıran şeyler de söylüyor, bu konuyu zaten konuşmuştuk."
"Son günlerde çok yorgunum ve kendimi toparlamak için biraz yalnız kalmaya ihtiyacım var, ancak partnerim bana bu fırsatı vermiyor ve üstüne üstlük beni tetikleyen şeyler de söylüyor."
"OCD/PMDD/ADHD'm var, bu yüzden her şeyi daha da kötüleştiriyorum. Ateş inme riski altında olduğu için delicesine strese giriyorum. Başı dönüyor ve sakarlaşıyor ve OCD/PMDD/ADHD'm var, bu yüzden her şeyi daha da kötüleştiriyorum. Sadece kendimi öldürmenin, onu kaybetmek, onu sinirlendirmek için 12 gün boyunca onu boşveren, duygusal bir kaltak gibi hissediyorum."
"Beni sürekli olarak korkutuyor, kendimi kötü hissetmeme neden oluyor."
"Kendimi çok çaresiz hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapabileceğimi düşünmüyorum."
Her şeyin üstüne çıkmış gibi hissediyorum.
"Gerçekten, bu durumun çok kötüye gitmesinden korkuyorum."
Bu yüzden sürekli olarak endişeleniyorum ve kendimi suçlu hissediyorum.
Bu müdahaleci düşüncelere sahip olmaya devam ediyorum: Ya ölüyorsa? Ya acı çekiyorsa? Bencil miyim? Onunla daha kaç yıl geçireceğim? Geçerken ne yapacağım? İntihar mı hissedeceğim? İlaçlar yüzünden benden nefret ediyormuş gibi hissediyorum ve daha da hastalanıp öleceğinden korkuyorum. Onu kaybetmeyi düşünüyorum ve sadece kıvrılıp ölmek istiyorum.
"Bütün bunları bir araya getirip düşünmek bile çok acı verici, daha da kötüsü onların gerçek olmasının ihtimali."
"Onu kaybettiğimi hayal bile edemiyorum, ne kadar acı vereceğini tahmin bile edemiyorum."
Acaba hep böyle düşünmeye devam mı edeceğim? Ya da bunların üstesinden gelebileceğim bir yol bulabilir miyim?
"Bencil olmaktan korkuyorum, sanki bir şekilde bu kötüye giden durumu kontrol edebiliyormuşum gibi."
Yaşadıklarımızın bir sonu olacak ve ben bunu kabul etmek için henüz hazır değilim.
O kadar çok mücadele ediyorum ki yaşamak için nedenler bulmaya çalışıyorum
"Yaşamaya devam etmek için kendime sürekli sebepler bulmam gerekiyor, çünkü mücadeleler çok fazla."
"Bu kadar çok zorlukla karşı karşıyayken, hayatta kalmak için kendimi motive etmem gerekiyor."
"Hayatın zorlukları o kadar çok ki, yaşamaya devam etmek için kendime sebepler bulmaya çalışıyorum."
"Mücadele etmekten yorulduğum için, yaşamaya devam etmek için bir sebep bulmaya çalışıyorum."
Her gün yeni zorluklarla karşılaşıyorum ve yaşamaya devam etmek için bir sebep bulmak zorunda hissediyorum.
"Kadın düşmanlığı kontrolden çıktı... Bir fikri paylaştığım, vurulan zaman miktarı... ve sonra bir başkası aynı fikri söylüyor ve GENIUS... ve kendim için konuştuğum bir seferinde, bana ""biz bir takımız, Katie, kredi önemsiz"" dendiğini belirttim."
Kadın düşmanlığı giderek artan bir sorun ve ben bu durumdan oldukça rahatsızım.
Bu kadar nefret dolu söylemler duymak gerçekten canımı sıkıyor.
Cinsiyet ayrımcılığı hakkında sesimi çıkardığımda nasıl tepki aldığımı görmek ürkütücü.
Kadınlar için bu tür önyargıları görmek gerçekten hayal kırıklığı yarattı.
"Toplumsal cinsiyet eşitliği konusunda çaba gösteren bir ekip olmak yerine, insanlar bunu önemsemez hale geldi."
luteal evrede nasıl aşırı düşündüğünü biliyor musun?... Seni tuzağa düşüren şeyler değil. Onlara odaklanmandır.... Kimsenin senin hakkında ne düşündüğünün ya da kimsenin seni nasıl algıladığının öneminden daha önemlisin. ** Hiçbir şeyin ya da herhangi birinin kendini daha iyi hissetmesini bekleyemezsin. seninle başlamak zorunda **.... En büyük düşmanın düşüncelerindir. Ya işe yararsa? Ya sadece kendine radikal bir şekilde inanırsan?
"Kendini iyi hissetmeni bekleyen hiçbir şey veya kimse yok, bu yolculuğu kendinle başlatmalısın."
"Başkalarının seni nasıl algıladığı değil, senin kendine olan inancın önemlidir."
"Düşüncelerine dikkat et, çünkü en büyük düşmanın onlar olabilir."
"Olumsuz düşüncelerin seni tuzağa düşürmesine izin verme, kendine inan."
Senin için en iyi şeyleri başarmak için önce kendine inanman gerekir.
"Genellikle uyku hijyenim harikadır, egzersiz yaparım, iyi yerim, propranolol ya da nükleere geçerim ve hiçbir şey ona dokunamaz."
"Uyku düzenimde hiçbir problem yok, sporumu yapıyorum, iyi besleniyorum, propranolol alıyorum ya da nükleere geçiyorum ve hiçbir şey beni rahatsız edemiyor."
"Uyku alışkanlıklarım çok iyi, egzersiz yapıyorum, sağlıklı besleniyorum, propranolol kullanıyorum ya da nükleere geçiyorum, hiçbir şey beni uykusuz bırakamıyor."
"Genellikle uyku düzenimde sıkıntı olmaz, düzenli egzersiz yaparım, iyi besleniyorum, propranolol kullanıyorum ya da nükleere geçiyorum, hiçbir şey uykuma engel olamıyor."
"Uyku hijyenime dikkat ediyorum, spor yapıyorum, sağlıklı besleniyorum, propranolol alıyorum ya da nükleere geçiyorum, hiçbir şey beni uyandıramaz."
"Uyku düzenim mükemmel, egzersiz yapıyorum, beslenmeme dikkat ediyorum, propranolol kullanıyorum ya da nükleere geçiyorum, hiçbir şey uykuma engel olamıyor."
"Neredeyse tüm semptomlarım var ve bir sürü deneyimi paylaşıyorum... Bu yılın başından beri her döngü bir işkence oldu ve sadece daha da kötüleşiyor gibi görünüyor. Her ayın 1 iyi haftası var. Adetim başlamadan 2 hafta önce, mutlak bir karmaşayım ve bugün o kadar yorgunum ki, iyileşmek zorunda olduğum zihinsel stresten bıktım.... Sonra 5: 30 pm geldi ve kafama takılmış bir anahtar gibiydi."
"Bu acı, her ay tekrar eden bir döngü gibi. "
Artık bu dönemden geçtiğimizde kendimizi iyi hissettiğimiz tek bir hafta var. 
Bu süreçte beynimdeki düşüncelerle mücadele etmekten bıktım.
"Birkaç gün sonra, her şey daha da kötüleşecek gibi görünüyor."
"Sonra, bir anda bir rahatlama geliyor ama bu da geçici."
"Son zamanlarda şiddetli pmdd nedeniyle jinekologuma gittim, bu da her ayın beş gününü bir haftasına mahvetti... ruh halim gerçekten uyuştu. Genellikle döngümün ilk yarısında enerjik hissediyorum, bu sefer sadece izole ve uyuşmuş hissediyorum... 7/24 kramplarım ve tipik dönem ishalim var."
"Bu ay PMS'im gerçekten beni çok kötü etkiledi, her şeyde moralim bozuldu ve kendimi çok yorgun hissediyorum."
"Bu ayki PMS'im çok şiddetli geçti, her şey beni sinirlendirdi ve kendimi çok tükenmiş hissediyorum."
"Son zamanlarda PMS'im çok yoğun, her şey beni üzüyor ve enerjim tamamen düştü."
"Geçtiğimiz aylarda PMS'im çok ağır geçti, her şey beni yoruyor ve kendimi çok mutsuz hissediyorum."
"PMS'im bu ay çok kötü, her şey beni sinirlendiriyor ve kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum."
Biraz daha az depresif
"Daha iyisi, biraz daha az depresif."
Biraz daha az depresif olmaya çalışıyorum.
Biraz daha az depresif hissediyorum.
Depresif olmak yerine biraz daha az düşünceli hissediyorum.
"Biraz daha az depresif, daha neşeliyim."
Yüksek anksiyetem var ve uzun zamandır düzensiz bir dönem geçirmedim. Düzenli 27 günümü 3 gün geç geçti. 31 gündür. Sadece bir dönemi her şeyden çok kaçırdığımı bilerek bana daha fazla endişe veriyor.
"Anksiyetemden dolayı son zamanlarda adet düzensizliğim var. 27 günlük döngümü 3 gün geç geçirdim, yani toplam 31 gün oldu. Sadece bir adet dönemini kaçırdığımı bilmek bile daha fazla endişelenmeme sebep oluyor."
"Adet düzensizliği yaşadığım için endişeliyim. 27 günlük döngümü 3 gün geçti, yani toplam 31 gündür. Tek bir adet dönemini kaçırdığımı bilmek beni çok endişelendiriyor."
Uzun zamandır düzensiz bir dönem geçirmediğimi düşünerek rahatlamıştım ama 27 günlük döngümü 3 gün geç geçirdim ve bu da 31 gün anlamına geliyor. Sadece bir dönemi kaçırdığımı bilmek beni daha da endişelendiriyor.
"Son dönemde anksiyetem çok yüksek. 27 günlük döngüm 3 gün geç geldi, yani toplam 31 gündür. Bir adet dönemini kaçırdığım için endişeleniyorum."
"Anksiyeteyle doluyorum ve adet düzensizliğim beni çok endişelendiriyor. 27 günlük döngümü 3 gün geç geçirdim, yani toplam 31 gündür. Sadece bir adet dönemini kaçırmış olmam beni daha da endişelendiriyor."
"Akıl hastası, daha kötü uyuyor, orgazm olamıyor, sadece hayatımdaki her şey genel olarak azaldı."
"Her şey daha zorlaştı, eskisi gibi hissedemiyorum."
"Enerjim düştü, hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum."
"İstekliliğim azaldı, her şey boş geliyor."
"Mutluluk hissi kayboldu, hayatım grileşti."
"Hayatımda hiçbir şey eskisi gibi değil, enerjim ve heyecanım bitti."
Hayatım boyunca depresyon ve anksiyeteden muzdariptim ve aslında sadece DEHB'ydi!... Sadece bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu düşündüm.
"Uzun zamandır kendimi kötü hissediyordum, ama sonunda bunun DEHB olduğunu öğrendim!"
"Hep bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu biliyordum, ama bunun DEHB'den kaynaklandığını fark etmedim."
"Depresyon ve anksiyete gibi sorunlar yaşıyordum, ama aslında bunlar DEHB'nin belirtileriymiş."
"Hayatım boyunca içsel bir mücadele veriyordum, meğerse sadece DEHB'yle mücadele ediyormuşum."
"Yıllarca kendimle savaştım, şimdi anlıyorum ki sadece beynimin farklı çalıştığı anlamına geliyormuş."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki bir daha asla kilo veremeyecekmişim gibi. Özellikle PMDD ile, her ay yemeyi bırakamıyorum, yaptığımda tam anlamıyla acı çekiyorum."
"Kendimi tamamen umutsuz hissediyorum, sanki bir daha asla sağlıklı bir ağırlığa ulaşamayacakmışım gibi."
"PMDD ile her ay aynı döngüde sıkışmış gibi hissediyorum, asla gerçek anlamda kontrol edemeyeceğim bir mücadele."
"Yemek yemek konusunda mücadele etmek çok zor, özellikle de PMDD'nin ağırlaştırdığı zamanlarda. Sanki hiçbir zaman kontrolüm altında olmayacakmış gibi hissediyorum."
Kendimi bu kadar kilolu hissetmek gerçekten beni mutsuz ediyor. Sanki asla değiştiremeyeceğim bir şeymiş gibi hissediyorum.
Her ay PMDD'nin beni nasıl etkilediğini görmek beni gerçekten sinirlendiriyor. Kendimi tamamen çaresiz ve kontrolsüz hissediyorum.
"Cildimin altında o kadar kötü ki, kistik sivilceler çıkarıyorum ki bu çok acı veriyor."
"Cildimin altında o kadar kötü ki, sivilcelerim her zaman iltihaplanıyor ve çok ağrıyor."
"Cildimin altı o kadar kötü ki, kızarıklık ve şişlik her zaman beni rahatsız ediyor."
"Sivilcelerim o kadar kötü ki, bazen dokunmak bile dayanılmaz oluyor."
"Cildimin altındaki sivilceler o kadar kötü ki, yüzümde sürekli bir ağrı hissediyorum."
"Bu sivilceler o kadar kötü ki, bazen gece uyuyamıyorum bile."
"Ne zaman luteal fazımı alsam, saldırımın anılarına geri çekiliyorum ve sadece ölmek istiyorum. Kokular, anlar, görüntüler, sesler ve yerler hemen travmamı getiriyor ve sadece bir delikte sürünmek ve kusmak istiyorum.... Midemde ve göğsümde o iğrenç mide bulantısı hissini hissettim ve her şey bir anda geri geldi.... Bugün zoloftuma başladım ama Tanrım... Bunu daha fazla hissedemiyorum."
Luteal fazımda olduğumda geçmişte yaşadığım travmatik anıları hatırlıyor ve sadece ölmek istiyorum.
Geçmişteki travmayı hatırlatıp beni tekrar o anlara götüren her şeyden kaçmak ve kendimi saklamak istiyorum.
"O anıları ve hisleri tekrar yaşamak çok zor, sanki ruhum bedenimden ayrılıyor gibi."
"Midemde ve göğsümde hissettiğim o iğrenç mide bulantısı hissi, geçmişte yaşadığım travmanın hala beni nasıl etkilediğini gösteriyor."
"Bu acı ve ıstırabı artık yaşamak istemiyorum, sadece bu hislerden kurtulabilirsem ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"Öfke canavarı olacağım, intihar edeceğim, enerjim olmayacak, libidom olmayacak ve genel olarak mutsuz bir insan olacağım."
Bu kadar acı çekmektense ölmeyi tercih ederim.
Hayatımı mahvedip kendimi herkesten izole edeceğim.
Mutluluk ve yaşama sevinci tamamen yok olacak.
Her şeyden nefret edip kendi kendime zarar vermeye başlayacağım.
Enerjim tükenip sadece boşluk hissedeceğim.
"Son bir buçuk yılda fark ettim ki, 5 yaşındaki kızım PMDD belirtilerimin devreye girdiği zamanlarda çok huysuzlaşıyor... çok küçük şeylerde ağlıyor, kolayca sinirleniyor, çok daha fazla yorgunluk. İlaçsız davrandığımda harekete geçtim."
"Kızımın PMDD belirtilerimin yoğunlaştığı dönemlerdeki davranışlarını gözlemledikçe, onun bu dönemlerdeki hassasiyetinin, huzursuzluğunun ve yorgunluğunun artışını fark ettim."
"Son bir buçuk yıl içinde kızımın, benim PMDD dönemlerimde daha huysuzlaştığını ve daha küçük şeylere ağladığını, kolayca sinirlendiğini ve çok yorgun olduğunu gözlemledim. Bu durum beni ilaçsız bir şekilde hareket etmeye zorladı."
"Kızımın PMDD belirtilerimin yoğunlaştığı dönemlerdeki değişen davranışları beni oldukça endişelendirdi. Küçük şeylere ağlaması, kolayca sinirlenmesi ve yorgunluğu beni harekete geçirdi."
"PMDD dönemlerimde kızımın daha huysuzlaştığını, küçük şeylere ağladığını, sinirlendiğini ve yorgun olduğunu fark ettiğimde, bu durumun ilaç kullanmadan kontrol altına alınması gerektiğini düşündüm."
"Kızımın benim PMDD belirtilerimin yoğunlaştığı zamanlarda daha da huysuzlaştığını ve küçük şeylere ağladığını, kolayca sinirlendiğini ve yorgun olduğunu gözlemledim. Bu durum beni ilaç kullanmayı düşünmeye itti."
Adetimden önceki her hafta kendimi öldürmeye çok yakınım...
"Adet dönemimden önceki günler hep çok zor geçiyor, kendimi kötü hissediyorum."
"Adet olmadan önceki günlerde kendimi kontrol edemiyorum, her şey çok zor geliyor."
"O dönemde her şey çok ağır geliyor, her an yıkılıp gidecekmiş gibi hissediyorum."
"Adet dönemim öncesinde enerjim tamamen bitiyor, her şey çok zorlaşıyor."
Kendimi kötü hissettiğim günler genellikle adet dönemimden önceki günler oluyor.
Dün gece tam bir panik atak geçirdim... Her gün bu düşünceler aklıma geliyor ve hayattaki her şeyle en kötü durum senaryolarını görüyorum... PMDD'nin yanında depresif bir bozukluğum var mı diye merak ediyorum. Ama şu anda PMDD'nin zirvesindeyim ve ağlamayı bırakamıyorum.... Anksiyete ve depresif bozukluğum olduğunu ve muhtemelen sahip olduğum obsesif düşüncelere katkıda bulunduğumu düşünmeye başlıyorum.
"Dün gece yine panik atak geçirdim, bu düşünceler sürekli olarak aklımı kurcalıyor, sanki her şey kontrolden çıkacakmış gibi hissediyorum."
"Bu PMDD belirtileriyle başa çıkmak çok zor, acaba altta yatan başka bir ruhsal sorun da mı var? Hep kötümser senaryolar kuruyorum."
"Sadece PMDD mi yoksa başka bir depresyon türü mü yaşıyorum bilmiyorum, şu an her şey çok yoğun ve kontrolsüz hissediyorum."
"Aşırı anksiyete ve depresif düşünceler beni çok yoruyor, her şeyin en kötüsü olacağını düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum."
"Bu PMDD süreci beni gerçekten çökertti, obsesif düşüncelerle doluyorum ve kendimi sürekli endişeli hissediyorum."
"Adetimden hemen önce bir, belki iki gece uykusuz kalırdım... ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım."
"Adetimden hemen önce birkaç gece uykusuz kalırdım, yorgunluğumun ne kadar büyük olursa olsun."
"Ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım, Adetimden hemen önce uyuyamamak beni rahatsız ederdi."
"Adetimden hemen önceki geceler, ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım, uykuyla aram açılırdı."
"Yorgunluğuma rağmen, Adetimden hemen önceki geceler uykudan mahrum kalırdım."
"Ne kadar yorgun olursam olayım, Adetimden hemen önceki geceler uyuyamazdım, sanki bedenim bir direnç gösteriyordu."
"Hala depresyondayım, düşük enerji"
"Kendimi hala kötü hissediyorum, sanki enerjim tükenmiş gibi."
"Depresyonun pençesindeyim, enerjim yok."
"Motivasyonum yok, enerjim çok düşük."
"Depresyon yüzünden çok yorgunum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum."
"Hala kendimi kötü hissediyorum, enerjim yerinde değil."
"Düzenli anksiyetem, tetiklendiğinde daha kötü olan ocd ve depresyonum var. Şu anda gerçekten kötü bir OKB, depresyon ve genel anksiyete nöbetindeyim, 9 ay önce kötü bir nöbet geçirdim ve daha önce bu yıl ve ergenlik döneminden geçerken başka bir tane daha yaşadım."
"Anksiyete, OKB ve depresyonum beni sürekli olarak etkiliyor ve tetikleyici durumlar olduğunda belirtilerim şiddetleniyor."
"Son zamanlarda yoğun bir OKB, depresyon ve anksiyete nöbeti yaşıyorum. Bu durum 9 ay önce de yaşandı ve bu yılın başlarında da benzer bir nöbet geçirdim."
"Ergenlik dönemimde de bu tür nöbetler geçirdim, ancak şu anki durumumun şiddeti beni gerçekten endişelendiriyor."
"Tetikleyiciler olduğunda yoğun anksiyete, OKB ve depresyon belirtileri yaşıyorum. 9 ay önce ve bu yılın başlarında yaşadığım nöbetler, durumun ne kadar zorlayıcı olduğunu gösteriyor."
"Anksiyete, OKB ve depresyonumla başa çıkmak zorunda kaldığım sürekli bir savaş halindeyim. Şu anda yaşadığım nöbet, bu mücadeleyi bir kez daha hatırlatıyor."
Bu bizi de sustururken çok cesaret kırıcı oluyor.
"Bu durum, bizi de sessizleştirip moralimizi bozuyor."
"Bu durum, bize de umutsuzluk ve sessizlik getiriyor."
"Bu, bizi de suskun bırakıp içimizi karartıyor."
"Bu gibi durumlar, insanı hem susturup hem de cesaretini kırıyor."
"Böyle olaylar karşısında, biz de konuşamadan moralimiz bozuluyor."
"Döngümü takip ediyorum...Duygularımı kaydediyorum ve kendime hormonlarım olduğunu ve geçeceğini hatırlatıyorum. Kendime karşı nazik olmak için elimden geleni yapıyorum...İş yerinde...emek benzeri kramplar geliyor ve ben de “Yarın kusacağım gibi hissediyorum...Sonra her ay kafamda çalan aynı mantra başlıyor. “Herkes senden nefret ediyor, bunlar senin gerçek arkadaşların değil, değersizsin, aptalsın, can sıkıcı ve sıkıcısın.”"
"Duygularımı kontrol altına almak için çabalıyorum, ama bazen iş yerinde gerginliğin zirveye çıktığını hissediyorum ve kendimi çaresiz ve yalnız hissediyorum."
"İç sesim sürekli olarak beni eleştiriyor, değersiz olduğumu söylüyor, ama ben kendime karşı nazik olmaya çalışıyorum, duygularımı kontrol etmeye çalışıyorum."
"Sanki hayatım bir döngüye hapsolmuş gibi hissediyorum, sürekli aynı duygusal iniş çıkışları yaşıyorum, kendimi kötü hissetmemek için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapıyorum."
"Her ay aynı duygusal fırtınaya kapılıyorum, kendimi değersiz ve yalnız hissediyorum, ama kendime karşı nazik olmaya çalışıyorum, bu geçici olduğunu hatırlatıyorum."
"İç sesim acımasız, sürekli olarak beni eleştiriyor, kendimi kötü hissetmemek için sürekli kendime hatırlatmalar yapıyorum, ama bazen bu yeterince etkili olmuyor."
Hap her zaman beni biraz depresyona sokar ama adeno / endo & PMDD'yi yönetmek için ihtiyacım var
İlaç bana her zaman biraz mutsuzluk hissettiriyor ama adeno / endo & PMDD'yi kontrol altında tutmak için onları kullanmam gerekiyor.
Bu hap beni sürekli olarak kötü hissettiriyor ama bu durumla başa çıkmak için onları kullanmam gerekiyor.
İlaçlar benim için çok zorlayıcı ama adeno / endo & PMDD semptomlarını hafifletmek için olmazsa olmaz.
Bu ilaçlar olmadan kendimi çok kötü hissederdim ama onların beni biraz mutsuz etmesi de beni üzüyor.
"İlaç kullanmak zorunda olduğum için üzgünüm, ancak adeno / endo & PMDD'yi yönetmek için onları kullanmam gerekiyor."
HRT dengesinin zor olduğunu anlamak
HRT tedavisinin zorlukları hakkında bilgi edinmek önemlidir.
HRT'nin beden üzerindeki etkisini tam olarak kavramak zor olabilir.
HRT'nin avantajlarını ve dezavantajlarını dikkatlice değerlendirmek gerekir.
HRT dengesini sağlamak bireyden bireye değişen bir süreçtir.
HRT kullanımıyla ilgili kararı verirken dikkatli olmak gerekir.
"Anksiyete, baş ağrısı, kafa basıncı, göğüs ağrısı ve mide bulantısı gibi semptomlar yaşıyorum ve dönemimin sona ermesinden sonraki günden yumurtlamamın sona ermesine kadar başlıyorlar. Özellikle sağlık kaygım şimdiye kadarki en kötü şeydi. Tüm baş ağrıları ve göğüs ağrıları beni sağlık kaygımı güçlendirmeye ve kalp krizi veya beyin anevrizması geçireceğim düşüncelere yol açıyor."
"Her ay aynı şeyleri yaşıyorum, dönemimin sona ermesinden sonraki günden yumurtlamamın sona ermesine kadar süren şiddetli anksiyete, baş ağrıları, göğüs ağrıları ve mide bulantıları beni mahvediyor."
"Bu semptomlar gerçekten korkutucu, baş ağrıları ve göğüs ağrıları beni kalp krizi veya beyin anevrizması geçireceğim düşüncesine kapılmama neden oluyor."
"Sağlık kaygım son zamanlarda çok kötüleşti, bu baş ağrıları ve göğüs ağrıları beni delirtiyor."
"Bu dönemden önce sağlık kaygım yoktu, ama bu fiziksel belirtiler beni gerçekten korkutuyor."
"Sanki vücudum bana karşı bir savaş açmış gibi, bu baş ağrıları, göğüs ağrıları ve anksiyete beni tamamen tüketiyor."
Şu anda depresyonumun derinliklerindeyim ve bu luteal fazla durmadan ağlıyorum
Depresyonun pençesindeyim ve luteal fazın bana getirdiği duygusal dalgalanmalar yüzünden sürekli ağlıyorum.
"Bu luteal fazda, depresyonum beni tamamen ele geçirmiş durumda ve kontrolsüzce ağlıyorum."
Depresyonumun en karanlık döneminde bulunuyorum ve bu luteal faz sanki duygusal bir fırtına gibi üzerime çöküyor.
Şu anki depresyonumun ağırlığı altında eziliyorum ve luteal fazın getirdiği hormonal değişimler beni sürekli ağlatıyor.
Luteal fazın etkisiyle birlikte depresyonumun dibine vurmuş durumdayım ve duygusal olarak çok hassasım.
Günlerdir yatalaktım. Yorgunluk kötü. Bu sabah sadece ağlayarak ve ağlayarak uyandım. Delireceğimden veya halüsinasyon göreceğimden korkuyorum. Bazen delicesine sıcak ve soğuk hissediyorum. Çok terliyorum. Günü 4 ve hormonlar o zaman düşük görünüyor mu? Ben de çok midem bulanıyor.
Grip olmuş gibi hissediyorum ve kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Uyandığımda çok yorgun ve bitkin hissediyorum. Kendimi iyi hissetmiyorum.
Belirtilerim çok kötü ve kendimi sürekli yorgun hissediyorum.
Ağrılarımdan ve halsizlikten dolayı kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum.
Yatağa bağlı kalmak zorunda olmak beni çok sinirlendiriyor.
"Belirtilerimin kişilik bozukluğunu taklit ettiğini hissediyorum. Döngüm boyunca, özellikle de luteal fazım boyunca kendimi aktif olarak değiştirdiğimi hissedebiliyorum. Daha iyi olmak istiyorum. Her zaman çok sinirli ve dengesiz hissetmemek istiyorum. Ve bazen topladığım tüm bilgilerle, sadece yönetebilmenin yanı sıra uzun vadede çok fazla yardımcı olmuyor gibi geliyor."
"Duygusal iniş çıkışlarımın beni bencil ve kontrolsüz gösterdiğini düşünüyorum, oysa aslında sadece hormonlarımın oyununa kurban gidiyorum."
"Her ay tekrar eden bu duygu dalgalanmalarının gerçek kişiliğimi gölgelediğini hissediyorum, sanki ben değilimmişim gibi."
"Bu dönemsel değişkenliklerin neden olduğu duygusal iniş çıkışlar, gerçek kişiliğimi gizliyor ve beni başka biri gibi gösteriyor."
Kendimi gerçekte olduğumdan daha olumsuz ve dengesiz gösterdiğini hissettiğim için bu duygusal iniş çıkışlarından kurtulmak istiyorum.
Bu hormonel dalgalanmaların neden olduğu davranış değişiklikleri yüzünden gerçek kişiliğimi yitirdiğim hissine kapılıyorum.
Günümün çok yakında olduğunu ve çok yakında gelmeyeceğini düşünüyorum.
Bu günlerin çok yakın olduğunu ve aynı zamanda çok uzak olduğunu düşünüyorum.
"Gerçekten çok yakında olduğunu düşünüyorum, ancak aynı zamanda çok uzak olduğunu da biliyorum."
"Çok yakın olduğunu hissediyorum, ama aynı zamanda çok uzak olduğunu da biliyorum."
"Günler çok hızlı geçiyor, ancak aynı zamanda çok yavaş da gidiyor gibi görünüyor."
"Bu günleri özlüyorum, ama aynı zamanda gelecek olanları da heyecanla bekliyorum."
hırçın günler/haftalar
Zorlu ve stresli günler/haftalar geçirdim.
"Her şeyin yolunda gitmediği, sıkıntılı günler/haftalar."
"Hayatın beni zorladığı, huzursuz günler/haftalar."
Mutsuz ve karmakarışık geçen günler/haftalar.
"İçinde bulunduğum olumsuzlukların ağır bastığı, sıkıntılı günler/haftalar."
"Her tarafım ağrıyordu, başım dönüyordu."
"Vücudumda hissetmediğim yer yoktu, başım da dönüyordu."
"Her yerim sızlıyordu, başım dönüyordu, sanki yere çökecekmişim gibi hissediyordum."
"Ağrılarım beni mahvetmişti, başım dönüyordu ve ayakta durmakta zorlanıyordum."
"Sırtım, boynum, bacaklarım, her yerim ağrıyordu, başım dönüyordu, adeta bir hastalık gibiydi."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyordum, her tarafım ağrıyordu, başım dönüyordu, sanki dünya tersine dönmüş gibiydi."
Sanki son bir aydır içimde yaşayan lanet olası bir iblisi temize çıkarmışım gibi hissettim.
"Kendimi bir ağırlıktan kurtulmuş, özgürleşmiş hissediyorum."
Sanki uzun süredir beni esir tutan bir zinciri kırmışım gibi.
İçimde birikmiş olan tüm olumsuzluğu atmış gibi hissediyorum.
Bir yükten kurtulmuş gibi rahatladım.
Sanki içimdeki karanlık bir bulut dağılmış gibi.
Her zaman depresyon/anksiyete yaşadım. 40'lı yaşlarımdayım ve son bir ya da iki yıldır TOM'um intihar zamanı! Her ay planlamak ya da kendimi kesmek ya da tüm gün ağlamak çok eğlenceli.
"Depresyon ve anksiyeteyle yıllarca mücadele ettim, özellikle son birkaç yıldır çok kötü. Artık hayatın zorluklarının üstesinden gelmekten bıktım ve kendimi sürekli olarak intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşuyorum."
"Yaşadığım bu yoğun depresyon ve anksiyeteyle başa çıkamadığımı hissediyorum. Son bir iki yıldır sürekli olarak intihar düşünceleriyle boğuşuyorum, bu durum beni çok yoruyor."
"Uzun zamandır mücadele ettiğim depresyon ve anksiyete son birkaç yıldır çok daha kötüleşti. Artık intihar düşünceleriyle yaşamaktan bıktım, her gün ölüm düşüncesiyle uyanıyorum."
"Yaşadığım depresyon ve anksiyete artık hayatımı yönetiyor. Son yıllarda intihar düşünceleriyle baş etmek benim için çok zorlaşıyor, bu durumu artık kaldıramıyorum."
"Depresyon ve anksiyeteyle boğuştuğum bu yıllarda sürekli bir umutsuzluk içindeydim. Son zamanlarda intihar düşünceleriyle yaşamaktan çok yorulduğumu hissediyorum, bu acı verici döngüden kurtulmak istiyorum."
"Ben... ağlıyorum çünkü blenderım kirli ve bu dünyaya sunacak hiçbir şeyim yok gibi depresif düşüncelerden oluşan yapışkan bir ağın içine spiralleşiyor, işe yaramazım, değersizim, hayatımın bir anlamı yok, ya da neden hayattayım. Kafamın üzerinde asılı olan kaygı ve umutsuzluk bulutlarını Billowing."
"Depresif düşünceler beni tamamen ele geçirmiş gibi hissediyorum, sanki bir bataklığa saplanmışım ve kendimi kurtaramayacakmışım gibi."
"İşe yaramaz hissetmek ve hiçbir şey yapamamak beni gerçekten mutsuz ediyor, bir yere ait olmadığımı hissediyorum."
"Bu dünyaya sunacak hiçbir şeyim olmadığını düşünmek çok zor, kendimi amaçsız ve anlamsız hissediyorum."
"Kendim hakkında kötü düşüncelerle doluymuş gibi hissediyorum, sanki hiç bir zaman iyi olamayacakmışım gibi."
"Kaygı ve umutsuzluk beni alt ediyor, sanki hiçbir zaman mutlu olamayacakmışım gibi."
Duygusal travmayı unuttum. TSSB veya CPTSD'den muzdarip olabileceklerini fark etmediklerini doğrulamak istiyorum. Travma ve PMDD arasında bir korelasyon var.
"Travmanın etkilerini artık hissetmiyorum, ancak diğerlerinin travma sonrası stres bozukluğu (TSSB) veya karmaşık travma sonrası stres bozukluğu (CPTSD) yaşadıklarının farkında olmayabileceklerini düşünüyorum."
"Geçmişteki duygusal travmayı atlattığımı düşünüyorum, ancak diğerlerinin TSSB veya CPTSD gibi travmaya bağlı bozukluklara sahip olabileceği konusunda farkındalık yaratmak istiyorum."
"Travma artık beni etkilemiyor, ancak birçok kişinin travmatik deneyimlerden kaynaklanan duygusal sorunlar yaşadığını düşünüyorum."
"Travmadan tamamen kurtulduğumu hissediyorum, ancak diğer insanların TSSB veya CPTSD yaşadıklarını ve yardım almaları gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"Geçmişteki travmayı unuttum, ancak travma ve ruhsal sağlık sorunları arasında bir bağlantı olabileceğini ve diğerlerinin bunu fark etmesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
Her zaman döngümle mücadele ettim... Yumurtlama ve menstruasyon sırasında en çok semptomları yaşıyorum
"Adet döngüsüyle başa çıkmak benim için hep zor oldu, özellikle yumurtlama ve menstruasyon dönemlerinde."
"Her ay aynı sıkıntılarla uğraşıyorum, yumurtlama ve adet kanaması dönemlerinde semptomlarım çok şiddetleniyor."
"Döngümün her aşamasında zorluk çekiyorum, ama özellikle yumurtlama ve adet gördüğüm zamanlarda çok kötü oluyorum."
Yumurtlama ve adet dönemlerinde yaşadığım semptomlar nedeniyle döngümle hep mücadele ettim.
Menstruasyon ve yumurtlama dönemlerinde yaşadığım semptomlar nedeniyle döngümle mücadele etmek çok zor oluyor.
Lanet bir sarmalda uyandım. Hepsi sadece umutsuzluk ve kıskançlık. Neden finansal korkular bu kadar ezici ve felç edici? Bir düşünce zihnimin söndüremediği bir ateşi kıvılcımlar.
"Hayatın anlamını sorguluyorum, bu anlamsız döngüde takılıp kaldım gibi hissediyorum."
"Korkularımın beni ele geçirdiğini hissediyorum, her şey karanlık ve umutsuz görünüyor."
"Bu kıskançlık duygusu beni tüketiyor, kendimi bir hapishanede gibi hissediyorum."
"Her şey umutsuzluğa yol açıyor, kendime bile güvenemiyorum."
"Bu finansal yük beni ezmeye devam ediyor, özgürleşmek için çaresizce bir yol arıyorum."
"Bugün baş ağrısı ve mide bulantısı. Umudum pms geldiğinde, aile ve ülkeden kaçmak ve kendini izole etmek istemiyorum."
"Bugün her şey ters gidiyor, baş ağrısı, mide bulantısı ve üzerime doğru gelen PMS... "
Bu PMS belirtileriyle baş edebilmek için bir robot olmak istiyorum.
"İlaçlar işe yaramıyorsa, tek çare dışarı çıkıp yürüyüş yapmak."
"Aile ve işten kaçmak istiyorum, bu günlerde hiç kimseyle görüşmek istemiyorum."
"Umarım PMS'den sonra kendime gelirim, yoksa yataktan çıkmak bile istemeyeceğim."
"Bu kalbimi kırıyor, bu kadar çok kadın bunu yaşamak zorunda ve yapabileceğimiz hiçbir şey yok."
"Bu durumun adil olmadığına inanıyorum, kadınların böyle şeylerden geçmek zorunda kalması çok üzücü."
"Bunun için elimizden gelenin en iyisini yapmaya çalışmalıyız, ancak bu acıya maruz kalan kadınlar için yapabileceğimiz pek bir şey yok gibi görünüyor."
"Hiçbir kadının böyle bir şey yaşamaması gerektiğine inanıyorum, buna bir çözüm bulmalıyız."
"Bu beni gerçekten öfkelendiriyor, bu kadınların bu acıyı çekmek zorunda bırakılması kabul edilemez."
"Bu soruna karşı çıkmaya devam etmeliyiz, kadınların seslerini duyurmaları için daha çok şey yapmalıyız."
Şimdiye kadarki en kötü ayrışmayı yaşadım ve o kadar hastaydım ki evden çıkamadım.
"Hayatımda hiç bu kadar kötü hissetmemiştim, kendimi o kadar kötü hissettim ki yataktan bile çıkamadım."
"Bu ayrılık hayatımı alt üst etti, kendimi o kadar kötü hissettim ki yataktan bile kalkma gücüm kalmadı."
"Şu an yaşadığım acıyı tarif edemem, kendimi o kadar kötü hissettim ki evden çıkmaktan bile korktum."
"Bu ayrılıktan sonra kendimi çok kötü hissettim, yataktan kalkacak gücüm bile kalmadı."
"Bu ilişkiyi bitirmek hayatımda en kötü deneyimdi, kendimi o kadar kötü hissettim ki günlerce evden çıkamadım."
"Üst üste üç ay, luteal fazın ilk gününde ruh halimin büyük ölçüde kötüleştiğini fark ettim... Son birkaç gün kendimi korkunç hissetmiştim."
"Üç ay boyunca, adet döngümün ilk gününde her zaman mutsuz ve depresif hissediyorum."
"Adet döngümün ilk günlerinde, kendimi kötü hissettiğim bir dönem geçirdim."
"Son birkaç ay, adet döngümün ilk günlerinde çok kötü hissettim ve hiçbir şey yapmak istemedim."
"Adet dönemimin başlangıç günlerinde, her zaman çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki dünyanın sonu gelmiş gibi."
"Özellikle adet döngümün ilk günlerinde, enerjim çok düşük ve sürekli bir üzüntü hissediyorum."
"Kimseyle konuşmak ya da bir şey yapmak ya da insanların etrafında olmak istemiyorum, sadece yalnız kalmaya ihtiyacım var. Herkesin söylediği ya da yaptığı her şey rahatsız edici, can sıkıcı geliyor. İşle başa çıkamıyorum, HER ŞEY o kadar ezici geliyor ki, yapmak istediğim tek şey uyumak."
"Herkesle iletişim kurmak, bir şeylere katılmak veya herhangi bir sosyal etkileşimde bulunmak istemiyorum, sadece kendimle kalmam gerekiyor."
"Herkesin sözleri, davranışları beni rahatsız ediyor, sinirlendiriyor. Çevremdeki herkesi engellemek ve kendimi korumak istiyorum."
"İşlerimin üstesinden gelemiyorum, her şey çok ağır geliyor. Her şeyden uzaklaşmak, kendimi yalnız hissetmek ve rahatlamak istiyorum."
"İnsanlarla konuşmak, bir şey yapmak veya toplum içinde olmak çok zorlayıcı. Tüm bu gürültüden uzaklaşmak, sessizliğe sığınmak istiyorum."
"Her şey o kadar yorucu ki, kendimi dinlemek, hiçbir şey yapmadan sadece var olmak istiyorum. Günlük yaşamın getirdiği zorluklara karşı koyacak gücüm yok."
"Hala işe yarayan bir ilaç bulmaya çalışıyorum, gözyaşlarımla mücadele ediyordum. Birkaç saat sonra hala üzülüyorum. Hatta kendi teşhisimi bile sorguluyorum, semptomlarımın PMDD için klinik kriterlere en iyi uyduğunu biliyorum."
"Her gün aynı mücadeleyi veriyorum, umutsuzluğun pençesinde boğuluyorum. Bu hastalığın beni ele geçirmesine izin veremem."
Bu hislerle boğuşmak çok zor. Her şeyin alt üst olduğunu hissediyorum. Hatta kendimi bile sorgulamaya başladım.
Acının derinliklerinde kayboluyorum. İlaçların işe yaraması için dua ediyorum. Bu hastalık hayatımı mahvediyor.
Kendimi çaresiz hissediyorum. Hastalığın beni ele geçirmesine izin veremem. Her şeyin daha iyi olacağına inanmak istiyorum.
Daha iyi bir yol olmalı. Bu acıya daha fazla dayanamam. Bir umut ışığı görmek istiyorum.
"Ağrı hissediyorum ve dopaminim her zaman düşük, üzgün, endişeli hissediyorum ve bu günlerde sadece bir kabuk gibi hissediyorum ve berbat."
"Kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum, sanki her şey boşuna gibi. "
"Her şey beni yoruyor, enerjim tükenmiş gibi hissediyorum. "
"Motivasyonum sıfır, her şey çok zor geliyor."
"Hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, kendimi yetersiz ve değersiz hissediyorum."
"Kendimi kötü hissediyorum, hiçbir şey yapmak istemiyorum, sanki her şeyden vazgeçmiş gibiyim."
"Adetim başlamadan 3 gün önce panik atak geçirmeye başladım, o zaman şimdi tam tersi olduğunda daha iyi hissederdim. Adetim başlamadan 2 hafta önce harika hissediyorum ve sonraki 2 hafta hayatım bulanık. Uyku sorunları, kaygı, depresyon, karışıklık, aşırı yorgunluk, döngümün etrafında sesler bile duydu."
"Adet döngümün ilk üç günü bana cehennem gibi geliyor, o zamanlar sanki vücudum savaş halinde gibi, gerisi ise daha normal geçiyor."
"Adet dönemi öncesinde sürekli bir gerginlik ve endişe içindeyim, sanki hayatımda her şey kontrolümden çıkmış gibi."
"Adet döngümün ikinci haftası harika geçiyor, sanki dünyanın en mutlu insanıyım, sonraki iki hafta ise her şey karmakarışık ve zorlu oluyor."
"Döngümün belirli günlerinde kendimi tamamen farklı biri gibi hissediyorum, sanki bedenim başka birine aitmiş gibi."
"Adet döngüsüyle birlikte gelen bu duygusal iniş çıkışları beni yoruyor, sanki sürekli bir savaş içindeyim, bu hisleri tarif etmek çok zor."
"Yan etkileri sevmedim, ama buna değdi. Gerçekten hormonların olduğunu biliyorum, derinden kırılmış bir parçam değil, bunu yapıyor. Neredeyse çocuk sahibi olabileceğimi hissettim. Çok fazla keder vardı."
Bu ilaç beni biraz kötü hissettirdi ama bebeğime kavuşmam için buna değerdi.
Hamile kalmaya çalıştığım süreçte ilaçların yan etkileri çok zordu ama sonuçta buna değerdi.
"Bir tarafta ilaçların yan etkilerini yaşamaktaydım, diğer yandan bebeğimin sağlıklı olduğunu bilmek beni mutlu ediyordu."
"Sanki bedenim bu ilaçlarla hamile kalmaya çalışıyor gibiydi, bu hissi çok özel buldum."
"Çocuk sahibi olmak için verdiğim bu mücadele beni çok derinden etkiledi, ama sonunda başardığım için çok mutluyum."
Ben de DEHB (olası OCD ve ASD) ile birlikte bir CPTSD tanısı var. İlerlemek için çok uğraştım ama luteal faz geldiğinde topu tepeye iten Sisifos gibi.
"Her gün her şeye rağmen ilerlemeye çalışıyorum, ama sanki bir savaş veriyorum ve sürekli olarak yeniliyorum."
"Hayatımın çoğu zaman bir mücadele olduğunu düşünüyorum, özellikle de luteal fazda."
"Zaten bir sürü zorlukla mücadele ediyorum, luteal faz geldiğinde sanki her şey daha da kötüleşiyor."
Kendimi sürekli olarak bir dağın tepesine taşıyan ama her seferinde aşağı yuvarlanan Sisifos gibi hissediyorum.
"İlerlemek için çok çabalıyorum, ama luteal faz geldiğinde kendimi hep aynı yerde hissediyorum."
Gerçekten iyi tolere ettim ve norethindrone'dan herhangi bir olumsuz yan etkisi olmadı.
"Norethindrone'u kullandığım sürece hiç sorun yaşamadım, hiçbir yan etkisiyle karşılaşmadım."
"Bu ilaç bana çok iyi geldi, hiç bir olumsuz etkisini görmedim."
"Norethindrone'u kullanmaya başladıktan sonra hiç bir yan etki yaşamadım, gerçekten çok iyi tolere ettim."
"Norethindrone'un yan etkilerini hiç hissetmedim, vücudum ilacı çok iyi kabul etti."
"İlaç benim için çok etkili oldu,  norethindrone'dan kaynaklanan olumsuz bir yan etki yaşamadım."
Ameliyatımdan yaklaşık bir yıl önce Orilissa'daydım. Lupron'un hap versiyonu temelde.
"Ameliyat olmadan önce bir yıl boyunca Orilissa kullanıyordum, Lupron'un hap versiyonu gibi."
Ameliyat öncesi bir yıl boyunca Lupron'un hap versiyonu olan Orilissa ile tedavi gördüm.
Lupron'un hap versiyonu olan Orilissa'yı ameliyattan yaklaşık bir yıl önce kullanmaya başlamıştım.
"Ameliyattan bir yıl kadar önce Orilissa'ya başladım, Lupron'un hap versiyonu yani."
"Orilissa, Lupron'un hap versiyonu, ameliyatımın yaklaşık bir yıl önce kullandığım ilaçtı."
HRT tekmelemeye ya da birikmeye başlayana kadar bitkin ve biraz depresyondaydım.
HRT'yi almaya başlamadan önce kendimi yorgun ve biraz depresif hissediyordum.
HRT'nin etkisini hissetmeye başlamadan önce enerjim çok düşüktü ve mutsuzluk hissediyordum.
HRT'nin bana gerçekten fayda etmeye başlamasını beklemek zorundaydım.
"HRT almak benim için bir dönüm noktası oldu, çünkü artık kendimi çok daha enerjik ve mutlu hissediyorum."
"HRT almaya başladıktan sonra kendimi çok daha iyi hissetmeye başladım, artık yorgunluğum ve depresyonum yok."
Nişanlımla tartışmaya başlıyorum çünkü yaptığı her şeye karşı hassasım... Hakkımda algılanan her küçük şeye karşı tam anlamıyla çok hassasım. Güvensizliklerim artıyor ve her şeyin sona erdiğini hissediyorum.
"Nişanlımla olan ilişkimiz son zamanlarda çok zorlu hale geldi, çünkü her şeye aşırı tepki veriyorum. Onun bana karşı yaptığı en ufak bir şey bile beni çok üzüyor."
"Bana karşı hassas davranmaya çalışıyor gibi görünüyor ama sanki ben hep yanlış anlıyorum. Her zaman kötü bir hisse kapılıyorum, sanki ilişkimiz bitmek üzereymiş gibi."
Öz güvenim çok düşük ve sürekli olarak ilişkimizin sona erdiğini düşünüyorum. Nişanlımın yaptıklarının hepsini yanlış anladığımı hissediyorum.
En ufak bir eleştiri bile beni çok üzüyor ve sanki ilişkimizin sonu gelmiş gibi hissediyorum. Bu durumun bizi tamamen yıpratacağından endişeleniyorum.
Nişanlımla sürekli kavga ediyorum ve her zaman ben suçlu gibi hissediyorum. Ona karşı çok hassas olduğumu biliyorum ama kendimi kontrol edemiyorum.
"Sadece sikimde değil. Beynimin umurunda değil. Sadece YouTube videolarını, podcast'leri, Reddit'i bazen insanlara bağlı hissetmemi sağlayan her şeyi önemsiyorum. Çünkü bu konuda insanlarla ya da etrafımdaki herhangi bir şeyle bağlantı kurmuyorum. Ve çevrimiçi olarak ilişki kurduğum insanları bulabilirim. Sanırım şu anda ilgilenmeliyim ama şu anda içimde hiçbir şey yok. Sadece her şeyi terk etmek ve başka bir yerde yeni bir hayata sahip olmak istiyorum."
"İnsanlarla bağlantı kurmak yerine, sadece çevrimiçi dünyaya bağlı hissediyorum. "
"Gerçek hayattaki ilişkiler beni yoruyor, tek istediğim her şeyi bırakıp yeni bir başlangıç yapmak."
"Bir bağ kurmak yerine, sanal dünyada ilgi alanlarımı takip etmek beni daha çok tatmin ediyor."
"Sosyal etkileşimler beni boşluğa düşürüyor, çevrimiçi platformlar benim için daha gerçekçi bir varoluş sunuyor."
"İnsanlarla iletişim kurmak yerine, teknolojiyle ve kendi dünyamda yaratabileceğim hayallerle bağlantı kurmayı tercih ediyorum."
Bu kadar kötü olmasını beklemiyordum çünkü birkaç ay boyunca reçeteli ilaçlarım olmadan iyiydim. Sadece kötü olduğunda alıyorum. Sadece bir yıldan az bir süre için teşhis edildim. Ve şimdi büyük bir depresyon dönemi geçiriyorum ve sakin kalmak ve ağlamamak için mücadele ediyorum.
"İlaçlarımı aldığımda genellikle kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum, bu yüzden bu kadar kötüye gideceğini düşünmüyordum."
"Bu kadar çabuk geri dönmesini beklemiyordum, çünkü bir süredir kendimi iyi hissediyordum."
"Gerçekten çok kötü hissediyorum ve sakin kalmak için mücadele ediyorum, ilaçlarımın etkisini göstermesi için biraz zaman geçmesi gerekiyor."
"İlaçların olumlu etkisinin çok kısa süreceğini düşünmüyordum, şimdi çok kötü hissediyorum."
"Bu depresyon dönemi çok yoğun, ilaçlarımı düzenli olarak almam gerektiğini düşünüyorum."
"Kontrolsüz sinirlilik, öfke ve ağır zayıflatıcı depresyon, kendimi çok değersiz ve hasarlı hissediyorum, içimde parçalanmış hissediyorum, zaten hassas ve duygusal kalbim canlı canlı yanmış gibi hissediyorum, yetersiz hissetmeden dışarı çıkamıyorum, bu dünyaya ait değilim. Yavaş yavaş ölüyorum. Tam anlamıyla hissedebiliyorum."
"Kendimi tamamen bitkin ve tükenmiş hissediyorum, her şey çok zor ve üstesinden gelemeyeceğim gibi hissediyorum."
"Sanki ruhumun parçası yok olmuş gibi, boşlukta kaybolmuş hissediyorum, nefes almak bile zor."
"Kendimi parçalanmış ve kırılmış gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şey anlam ifade etmiyor, umutsuzluğun karanlığı her şeyi kapladı."
"Çaresizlik ve yalnızlık içinde boğuluyorum, kimseye ulaşamıyorum, kimse anlamayacak gibi hissediyorum."
"Hayatın anlamını kaybettim, hiçbir şeyden zevk alamıyorum, her şey gri ve donuk, sanki bir boşlukta yaşıyorum."
Bu tür şeyler beni kelimenin tam anlamıyla bu gezegenden uzaklaştırmak istiyor.
Bu olaylar beni gerçekten bunaltıyor.
Bu durumlar beni hayattan soğutuyor.
Bu gibi şeylere artık tahammül edemiyorum.
Bu yaşadıklarım beni delirtiyor.
"Artık dayanamıyorum, her şeyden bıktım."
"Sürekli SI ve yıkıcı düşüncelerim olurdu, düşüncelerimde tamamen sanrılı olurdum, bazen günlerce arka arkaya sob olurdum, yataktan çıkmak için mücadele ederdim, öfkeli ve sıcak huylu olurdum, arkadaşlarımdan ve ailemden tamamen çekilirdim, ki bu bana hiç benzemiyordu."
"Depresif ve yıkıcı düşünceler içinde kaybolur, gerçeklikten kopar, günlerce yataktan çıkamaz, öfkeli ve sinirli hale gelir, kendimi sosyal hayatımdan tamamen soyutlardım, bu benim için çok yabancı bir durumdu."
"Sürekli olarak olumsuz düşüncelerle boğuşur, gerçeklikten kopardım kendimi, günlerce yataktan çıkamaz, sinir ve öfke patlamaları yaşardım, tüm sosyal ilişkilerimden uzaklaşır, kendimi tanıyamaz hale gelirdim."
"Kendimi olumsuz düşüncelerin esiri hisseder, gerçeklikle bağımı kaybeder, günlerce yataktan çıkamaz, sinir ve öfke dolu bir hale gelir, ailemden ve arkadaşlarımdan tamamen uzaklaşırdım, bu bana hiç benzemiyordu."
"Olumsuz düşünceler zihnimi ele geçirir, gerçeklikten uzaklaşır, günlerce yatağa bağlı kalır, öfke ve sinirle dolu bir şekilde yaşar, sosyal hayatımı tamamen bırakır, kendimden uzaklaşır gibi hissederdim."
"Yıkıcı düşüncelerle mücadele eder, gerçekliğe tutunamadığım zamanlar olur, günlerce yataktan çıkamaz, öfkeyle karşı karşıya kalır, tüm sosyal ilişkilerimden kopar, bu benim için anormal bir durumdu."
"İçten dışa doğru kopmuş gibi hissediyorum, kavga ediyorum, alçaklarla çok kötü savaşıyorum, düşünceler çok yoğun."
"İç dünyamla dış dünyam arasında kopukluk hissediyorum, bir savaş içindeyim, düşüncelerim yoğun ve kaotik."
"İç huzursuzluğum artıyor, kendimle ve çevremdeki insanlarla mücadele ediyorum, zihnim yoğun bir düşünce akışıyla dolu."
"Sanki içimden dışarıya doğru bir parçalanma yaşanıyor, her şey karmakarışık, mücadele etmek zorundayım."
"Kendimi parçalanmış hissediyorum, kaos içindeyim, düşüncelerim beni tüketiyor."
"İçimde bir çatışma var, mücadele etmekten yoruluyorum, zihnim bir fırtına gibi."
"PMDD semptomlarını, özellikle ruh halindeki damlaları / kaymaları deneyimlemeye başlayın"
PMDD'den kaynaklanan duygusal dalgalanmalar beni oldukça endişelendiriyor.
"Önceden hiç olmadığım kadar yoğun duygusal dalgalanmalar yaşıyorum, bu PMDD'nin belirtileri olabilir mi?"
"Ruh halimde çok ani değişimler oluyor, sanki bir anda mutluluktan üzüntüye düşüyorum. Bu PMDD'nin semptomları olabilir mi?"
"Özellikle ruh halimde aniden değişimler oluyor, bu durum beni çok bunaltıyor."
"PMDD semptomları, özellikle de ruh halindeki ani iniş çıkışlar, hayatımı zorlaştırıyor."
"Cehennem haftasının sona erdiğini inkar edilemez bir şekilde hissetmek genellikle adetinle tetiklenir, değil mi? Birdenbire beynimin hissettiği çok açık kafalı hissettim."
"Adet döneminin başlamasıyla birlikte o her zamanki kaosun sona erdiğini hissetmek, sanki dünya yeniden düzene giriyor gibi."
"Cehennem haftası boyunca yaşadığım gerginlik ve sinirlilik, adetimle birlikte yok olup gitti, sanki bir düğmeye basılmış gibi."
"Adetin başlamasıyla birlikte o 'her şey çok fazla' hissi uçup gidiyor, yerine sanki yeni bir sayfa açılıyor."
"Adet dönemi geldiğinde sanki tüm vücudum rahatlıyor, ruhum hafifliyor ve beynim daha açık çalışıyor."
"Adetin başlamasının hayatı yeniden düzenleme, kontrolü yeniden ele geçirme etkisi var, değil mi? Sanki her şey yerine oturuyor."
"Bir gün o kadar yorgundum ki yatağımdan çıkamıyordum, ama daha yeni uyumaya, yemeğe vesaire verdim."
"Çok yorgundum, kendimi yataktan kaldıracak halim yoktu ama yine de uyumak, yemek gibi şeyleri erteledim."
"O gün kendimi yataktan kaldırıp başka bir şey yapmak için çok yorgun hissettim, ama uyumak ve yemek gibi şeyleri ertelemek zorunda kaldım."
"Yorgunluktan yataktan kalkamıyordum, ama uyumak ve yemek gibi temel ihtiyaçlarımı bile ertelemek zorunda kaldım."
"Öyle yorgundum ki yataktan kalkacak halim yoktu, ama uyumak ve yemek gibi ihtiyaçlarımı erteledim."
"O gün o kadar yorgundum ki yataktan çıkmaktan acizdim, ancak uyumak, yemek gibi temel ihtiyaçlarımı ertelemek zorunda kaldım."
"Son derece depresyona giriyorum ve biri bana yaklaşmadan önce onları uyarıyorum. Güvensiz, muhtaç ve endişeli oluyorum. Hipomani bile alıyorum. Travmadan dolayı zaten hiperseksüelim ama yoğunlaşıyor."
"Depresyonlarımı kontrol edemiyorum, insanlar yaklaşmadan önce onları uzaklaştırıyorum."
"Sürekli olarak endişeli ve güvensiz hissediyorum, en ufak bir yakınlaşmada geri çekiliyorum."
"Kendimi korumak için duvarlar örüyorum, çünkü her yaklaşımı bir tehdit olarak algılıyorum."
"İnsanlarla yakınlaşmak beni aşırı derecede tedirgin ediyor, bu yüzden önceden onları uzaklaştırmayı tercih ediyorum."
"Travmanın yarattığı hiperseksüellik, depresyon ve hipomanik dönemle birleşince yaşamımı kontrol etmeyi zorlaştırıyor."
Bir düğmenin kapandığını hissediyorum ve partnerimle genellikle yaptığım derin duygusal bağlantıya sahip değilim. Sadece bir çeşit var olduğum ve genellikle sahip olduğum sevgi dolu duygulara sahip olmadığım kadar empatik veya sevecen hissetmiyorum.
"Aramızda bir soğukluk hissediyorum, sanki bizi bağlayan o sıcaklık kaybolmuş gibi."
"Onunla aramda bir engel var, sanki bir duvar örülmüş gibi ve duygularım geçemez hale gelmiş."
"Onunla olan yakınlığımız azaldı, eskisi gibi duygusal bir bağ hissetmiyorum."
"İçten bir kopukluk hissediyorum, sanki birbirimizi anlamaya çalıştığımız o yolculuk sona ermiş gibi."
"Onunla ilişkimde bir mesafe oluştu, duygusal bağımız eskisi gibi güçlü değil."
"“Premenstrüel disforik bozukluğun etkileri yaşam değiştiricidir. Bir tahmine göre, etkilenenler, yaşamları boyunca kümülatif olarak neredeyse dört yıl sakatlık yaşayabilirler. ” Bir çalışmada, bozukluğu olan katılımcıların% 72'si yaşamları boyunca intihar düşünceleri olduğunu söyledi. Ve% 34'ü, genel nüfusun% 3'üne kıyasla intihara teşebbüs ettiklerini söyledi. “Birey olarak bu benim için meşru bir şey değil."
"Premenstrüel disforik bozukluk, insanların hayatını olumsuz yönde etkileyen ciddi bir durum."
"Bu rahatsızlığın, kişilerin yaşam kalitelerini ve işlevselliklerini önemli ölçüde etkilediğini gördük."
Bu hastalığın bireylerin fiziksel ve ruhsal sağlığını ciddi şekilde etkilediğini ve günlük yaşamlarını zorlaştırdığını söyleyebiliriz.
"Premenstrüel disforik bozukluk, insanların işlerini, ilişkilerini ve genel yaşamlarını olumsuz yönde etkileyebilen şiddetli bir durumdur."
Bu durumun insanların yaşamlarını bu kadar olumsuz etkilediğini görmek gerçekten üzücü.
Bazen herkese ve her şeye karşı ilgisiz hissediyorum. Bu genel bir IDGAF. Ölsem bile umurumda değil.
"Her şeye karşı ilgisiz ve kayıtsız hissettiğim zamanlar oluyor, sanki hiçbir şey beni etkilemiyor gibi."
"Bazen hiçbir şey umrumda değilmiş gibi hissediyorum, hiçbir şeyin önemi yok."
"Günün sonunda, her şeyin boşuna olduğunu ve hiçbir şeyin umrumda olmadığını düşünüyorum."
"Kendimi tamamen kopuk hissediyorum, herkes ve her şey bana yabancı geliyor."
"Sanki bir kabuğa çekilmiş gibiyim, dış dünyanın hiçbir şeyini umursamıyorum."
Luteal sırasında çok yiyorum ve ortağım bana aşırı yemenin genel düzenlemem için kötü olup olmadığını sorana kadar hiç sorgulamadım.
"Luteal fazımda çok fazla yemek yediğimi fark ettim, ancak ortağım aşırı yememin sağlığım için kötü olup olmadığını sorana kadar hiç endişelenmemiştim."
Luteal fazımda iştahımın arttığını fark ettim ama ortağım aşırı yemenin düzenli hayatımı etkileyip etkilemediğini sorana kadar hiç düşünmemiştim.

"Luteal fazım sırasında çok yemek yediğimi hissettim, ama ortağım aşırı yememin genel sağlığımı etkileyip etkilemediğini sorana kadar hiç düşünmemiştim."
"Hala dumanlanıyorum. Kendimi korkunç derecede iğrenç hissediyorum. Ne kadar iğrenç bir insan olmalıyım. Yan odada onları duyan gözyaşlarına yakınım; Yorgunum ve kendimi öldürmem gerektiğini hissediyorum. Çok korkunç ve saygısız hissediyorum ve evim bana ait değil gibi. Gerçekten deli hissediyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum. Bu luteal, tüm bu acı ve acı çekmeden önce hiç düşünmediğim bir seviyede acıyor."
"Kendimi bu kadar kötü hissetmemem gerekiyor, böyle olmamalı."
"Böyle hissetmemeliyim, gerçekten kötü hissediyorum."
"Bu kadar kötü hissetmemeliyim, bir daha asla bu kadar kötü hissetmemeliyim."
"Her şey çok fazla, bu acıyı kaldıramam."
"Bu kadar kötü hissetmemeliyim, bunu nasıl düzeltebilirim?"
pmdd fişekleri bir ilişkide olduklarında çok daha kötü olur.

Ağlamaya başladım ve kederden bunaldım... Tamamen umutsuz ve bunalmış hissettim. PMDD sırasında daha yoğun intihar düşüncelerim başladı. Gerçekten korktum ve denemek için güçlü bir arzu hissettiğim için Lifeline ile iletişime geçmeyi düşünüyordum. Kafamda değilmiş gibi hissettim. Farklı bir insanmışım gibi. Zihnim sadece yatağa gitmek için çığlık atmaya devam etti.
"PMDD semptomları beni tamamen tüketti, kendimi çaresiz ve umutsuz hissettim."
"İntihar düşünceleri çok yoğunlaştı, bu durumdan kurtulmanın imkansız olduğunu hissettim."
"Korkularım arttı, zihnim sürekli olarak en kötü senaryoları canlandırıyordu."
Yaşadığım yoğun üzüntü ve umutsuzluk beni tamamen yiyip bitirdi.
"Kendimi kontrol edemediğimi, sanki vücudumun beni ele geçirdiğini hissediyordum."
