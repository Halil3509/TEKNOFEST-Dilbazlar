I’m at University doing a very niche course so the class size is tiny, I haven’t really made any real friends, & I’ve fallen out of touch with the few old Highschool friends i once had. I naturally befriended alot of introverts & avoidant type of people, so neither cared too much to maintain contact after HS ended. Also, reconnecting isn’t an option because one of them went completely ghost on all of us, & the ‘group’ fell apart…plus after a year of not talking it’s fair to say we’re strangers now. Anywho, I’m also at a stage where my lack of social life is bothering me whereas I used to quite enjoy being alone in the past, which has lead me to allow all these friendships to fizzle out. I just want a few friends that I can confide in, tell about my day, & hear about theirs. I’m not confident enough to strike up conversations with people either, I need to work on my social skills but I’m not sure where to start? When I know what to talk about I’m more confident, but small talk makes me feel like an alien pretending to be normal. Having no friends is really affecting my mental health, life feels so repetitive & mundane when you don’t have friends , I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.\n",

I see shy people but a lot of them are fine communicating with friends or family. Like my dad wants me to call & talk more but I cry if he says something that triggers me. I avoid calls but aunts or uncles don’t wanna accept it. I’m fine with text but they prefer call. A friend I had is distant because she prefers in person & I have to deal with that because I just prefer text. Most people around have friends as well. I struggle to communicate with anyone whether I’m used to them, close to them or not. I find others online with SAD but not in person. Anyone can relate? Is this disorder rare? I feel alone & like no one understands/empathizes with why I struggle to make friends or communicate with family :( They might be shy but they don’t have SAD. I’m so triggered by people, although I like people the triggers makes me isolate & withdraw. I feel judged all the time & overthink every single social interaction (including with family). It doesn’t help that my sister is naturally friendly compared to me. Also, I hate most jokes. I just don’t find them funny. \n",

      "Last night, I (F 23) went to a concert with my friends. The general audience population was a little older as this band was big in the disco era of the 70s/80s. Growing up listening to them, I was so excited to go to this concert and see this band in person. I got some really cheap nosebleed tickets (~$30) and me and my four friends sat in the second row behind this older couple. I am generally socially awkward, and I tend to miss social cues when I’m excited. Throughout the concert, I was very loudly cheering and singing along, as well as chatting with my friends and laughing. In the middle of a slower song, this older lady (70s?) turns around, smacks me on the leg, and says “Can you be quiet?” I know that I can be loud and not notice and fail to realize when people around me get upset. (I think I might have some hearing damage?) I just said, “yeah, okay” and turned back not knowing what else to say. I can see how this may have come off as disrespectful. She stared at me for a few more seconds before turning back. I really felt like crying and shut down immediately, but my friends comforted me. I’m just at a loss. I truly was being myself and enjoying my time, but I can’t help but feel super guilty and like an asshole for ruining this couples night. The couple left early and I truly enjoyed the finale, but this is all I can think about. Did they leave early because of me? Did I ruin their night?  I tend to find it hard to let go of things like this. Should I sacrifice my true self for the comfort of others? \n",

I got some really cheap nosebleed tickets (~$30) and me and my four friends sat in the second row behind this older couple. I am generally socially awkward, and I tend to miss social cues when I’m excited. Throughout the concert, I was very loudly cheering and singing along, as well as chatting with my friends and laughing. In the middle of a slower song, this older lady (70s?) turns around, smacks me on the leg, and says “Can you be quiet?” I know that I can be loud and not notice and fail to realize when people around me get upset. (I think I might have some hearing damage?) I just said, “yeah, okay” and turned back not knowing what else to say. I can see how this may have come off as disrespectful. She stared at me for a few more seconds before turning back. I really felt like crying and shut down immediately, but my friends comforted me. I’m just at a loss. I truly was being myself and enjoying my time, but I can’t help but feel super guilty and like an asshole for ruining this couples night. The couple left early and I truly enjoyed the finale, but this is all I can think about. Did they leave early because of me? Did I ruin their night?  I tend to find it hard to let go of things like this. Should I sacrifice my true self for the comfort of others? \n",

      "Last night, I (F 23) went to a concert with my friends. The general audience population was a little older as this band was big in the disco era of the 70s/80s. Growing up listening to them, I was so excited to go to this concert and see this band in person. I got some really cheap nosebleed tickets (~$30) and me and my four friends sat in the second row behind this older couple. I am generally socially awkward, and I tend to miss social cues when I’m excited. Throughout the concert, I was very loudly cheering and singing along, as well as chatting with my friends and laughing. In the middle of a slower song, this older lady (70s?) turns around, smacks me on the leg, and says “Can you be quiet?” I know that I can be loud and not notice and fail to realize when people around me get upset. (I think I might have some hearing damage?) I just said, “yeah, okay” and turned back not knowing what else to say. I can see how this may have come off as disrespectful. She stared at me for a few more seconds before turning back. I really felt like crying and shut down immediately, but my friends comforted me. I’m just at a loss. I truly was being myself and enjoying my time, but I can’t help but feel super guilty and like an asshole for ruining this couples night. The couple left early and I truly enjoyed the finale, but this is all I can think about. Did they leave early because of me? Did I ruin their night?  I tend to find it hard to let go of things like this. Should I sacrifice my true self for the comfort of others? \n",

      "Last night, I (F 23) went to a concert with my friends. The general audience population was a little older as this band was big in the disco era of the 70s/80s. Growing up listening to them, I was so excited to go to this concert and see this band in person. I got some really cheap nosebleed tickets (~$30) and me and my four friends sat in the second row behind this older couple. I am generally socially awkward, and I tend to miss social cues when I’m excited. Throughout the concert, I was very loudly cheering and singing along, as well as chatting with my friends and laughing. In the middle of a slower song, this older lady (70s?) turns around, smacks me on the leg, and says “Can you be quiet?” I know that I can be loud and not notice and fail to realize when people around me get upset. (I think I might have some hearing damage?) I just said, “yeah, okay” and turned back not knowing what else to say. I can see how this may have come off as disrespectful. She stared at me for a few more seconds before turning back. I really felt like crying and shut down immediately, but my friends comforted me. I’m just at a loss.

(I think I might have some hearing damage?) I just said, “yeah, okay” and turned back not knowing what else to say. I can see how this may have come off as disrespectful. She stared at me for a few more seconds before turning back. I really felt like crying and shut down immediately, but my friends comforted me. I’m just at a loss. I truly was being myself and enjoying my time, but I can’t help but feel super guilty and like an asshole for ruining this couples night. The couple left early and I truly enjoyed the finale, but this is all I can think about. Did they leave early because of me? Did I ruin their night?  I tend to find it hard to let go of things like this. Should I sacrifice my true self for the comfort of others? \n",

Felt good and her reaction gave me a good confidence boost, pushing through that anxiety felt liberating too. Although i think thats enough human interaction for the day lol, \n",

      "Im 23F and my friend is 23F. I have known her and been bestfriends with her since middle school. Some key points are\n",
      "We were bestfriends right when i moved to her school in 7th grade. I started dating this guy (Z) that was bestfriends with her older brother. He was my first boyfriend i really did anything with. He ended up cheating on me after we dated for like a year. Fast forward, we break up obviously and then he dates this one girl (K)and they become serious. They were dating from Freshmen year to sophomore year. During the time that they were dating, he was still texting me and telling me that he still loved me and that he wants to be with me but “cant leave her” so we had to be a secret. I was about 14-15 at the time and he was like 16. So even when we dated (i was 13) i sent him naked pictures because he pressured me into it. Fast forward, The girlfriend finds the photos of me on his phone and sends them to her little sister (in my grade) and they both start showing everyone. \n",
      "My dad was a coach at the same school and both of my older brothers went to the same school so they all heard about it. I remember my brother threatening to beat me up in front of everyone for sending them. The pictures that she found, were from when i was 13 and we were still dating. I believe im 14/15 at this point because i was in 8th grade and she was a freshman. It was a very small town so his family found out, my family found out, the teachers knew, the coaches knew, other friends families knew. Everyone knew and stopped talking to me and i got bullied pretty badly during this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only friends were these 2 girls. We will call them Jen and amy. Me and Jen were closer than me and amy. Jen and amy were closer than me and jen. I noticed that after this all came out they both started not asking me to hang out as much. They would both make plans together and not tell me, both sneak out and go do stuff and not tell me, shit, even when i would invite them to do stuff they would say they couldnt but then i would see them hanging out together. Just really depressing dynamic and detrimental to my mental health at the time because of what was going on at school and how they were leaving me out and essentially not wanting to be around me. \n",
      "I noticed every little change from that point. They would pair up with eachother in class for projects, they would text eachother more, spend the night constantly with eachother even though i could barely convince either of them to stay at mine. I talked to them about how i felt like i was being left out and they would invited me to like maybe one thing after that but then would stop. So i grew more resentfull. I soon moved to a different school my junior year and it was an even smaller school 10 min away from the school i was at. \n",
      "They stopped talking to me really ever. Amy completely stopped talking to me, Jen and i kept up with eachother but slowly drifted apart because i stopped reaching out. I had made 2 other friends during this time freshman year-sophomore year and they filled the void that she left and helped me cope with how she treated me at the end of our friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, thats a little backstory. One thing that was super weird was when i was a junior the boy that spread my nudes reached back out to me and sweet talked me into sleeping with him and stupidly i did. I remember someone had told his ex (the girl that spread my nudes) that i slept with him and i found out it was jens little sister so i was confused bc Jen and amy were the only ones that knew  and  i was like wtf? why is she concerned about it like thats so weird? Come to find out, im pretty sure it was jen who had her follow me and him to his house and then she (the ex) found out an hour later? The ex and jen were in the same friend group bc of softball. Anyways. \n",
      "Years go by and i see that jen and my first boyfriend are dating and im like omg good for them like they were life long bestfriends basically and now they are dating! And then i start thinking about it more and im like.. what if she was being weird to me all these years because they were secretly together? Which i know is true because i just remembered that the ONE TIME they did invite me to sneak out with them, it was at his house and everyone was getting drunk (we were all like 16) and we made out and i remember she randomly started bawling crying and ran away. I didnt know she was upset until we came back from making out and everyone said she was really drunk and ran into the woods crying. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldnt talk to anyone but him and amy. She ended up staying the night over there i think? Which idk why i didnt question that lol. i genuinely didnt think anything was going on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, fast forward to 2020 and my friends are like we should invite jen over and get drunk and rekindle. So we did and it was us 4 and it was so fun. It felt like we were all the bestest of friends. jen would randomly flake after a while but when she would come over there was a lot of sexual tension between me and her and we ended up doing things while we were really drunk and she stopped midway and went home. I remember crying because i was really drunk and felt like embarrassed that she left? and when i asked her about it she was like yeah idk what that was but i was just really drunk and i was like yeah me too but lets not make it weird and just move on and then things were like normal but then she would completely stop coming to hang out with us and stuff got weird again. \n",
      "I later stopped being friends with the other two girls due to other shit and jen was now 1 of my 4 actual friends. We grew close during these past couple of years but the dynamic has always been the same. She never invites me to anything but always has amy and another friend (D) that we were both close with as well but they were much closer together. \n",
      "I would watch them all 3 post with eachother every other weekend getting drunk and going out and feel like i was in highschool again. I remember i brought this up to jen and she started inviting me to maybe one or two things (both involved drinking) which i dont really love doing and she knows. i went out a couple times whth the 3 but the shit was the same, I wouldnt really be involved it was just them having fun and then me being there. But then she would be really nice and normal to me when we would snap and stuff. \n",
      "I literally cant remember the last time we did anything just by ourself together. I had her over to swim a month ago and thats the only time ive hung out with her alone in years and it was fun! Ive tried inviting her to a couple of things after that and shes always busy or its always something but then will post with amy or her little sister who she’s bestfriends with. She recently had a bad falling out with her other bestfriend (we will call her D) D and her hooked up while drunk and D randomly stopped talking to her completely after this. This left Jen very confused and depressed and i could see alot of me in her for a while. She would obsess over why D left her and is ignoring her. She had talked it out with her (what happened) and they both agreed that they were just drunk and it wasnt a huge deal. But obviously D was in love with her and jen is in a straight relationship. \n",
      "Anyways, Shes kinda used me as a therapist at this point but in my head im like i know how she feels and shes still my friend and i should be here for her and now that shes kinda over it (d ghosted her like 3 months ago) shes slowly becoming less interested in being my friend. \n",
      "THATS THE END OF THE BACKSTORY\n",
      "\n",
      "She recently got engaged to (the middle school boyfriend, Z. They were throwing a engagement party and invited me and my fiance A. Me and A have been together for 7 years and are very comfortable in our relationship and he knows about the whole situation from highschool/middle school and we both dont really think about it much. Anyways we show up to jens party and her family is there, his is there, the friends from highschool are there. It was a bit weird but we werent thinking too much about it. Anyways, she says hi to us and doesnt introduce us to literally ANYONE and just guides us outside and we find a seat. Theres a couple of tables and a deck and we sit at an empty table and just chill for a bit because we dont know these people and jen hadnt come out to talk to us at all or anything so his step dad and sisters sit next to us and dont really acknowledge us (which is fine,just really awkward) but Z comes up and sits down to eat and literally does not acknowledge me or A (my fiance) at all. We kept trying to include ourselves in the conversation but it would fall flat because no one would add on to it. At this point, his mom comes up (im friends with his mom on fb) bc shes friends with my parents and shes always been really nice to me but she literally just looked at me and says nothing and started talking to the step dad. I was like .. am i missing something? at this point we were like okay is jen going to come out and try and include us in anything like this feels weird and unwelcoming. She comes out and sits at the table right next to us with the other friends/girls that were my age. and she doesnt even attempt to invite me over. I was like ouch but its okay shes probably stressed because hosting a party is hard but then she starts taking pics with the other girls one at a time in front of the picture stand and didnt even ask me. She didnt talk to me ONCE during the party. All she said was hi and then guided us outside. this is someone i talk to everyday almost everyday and keep in mind we live an hour and a half away so i would have thought should have been happier to see us. Anyways, i text my partner and am like okay we have been here for 2 hrs and its not the vibe like this is weird and he agrees and so i get up to go inside and find jen and i walk in the kitchen and its some of the other couples that are my age and i literally know half of them and they all just go quiet. I break the silence by asking politely if jen was in here or if they have seen her and they all just say she is outside in the front and im like oh okay thank you and i walk outside and cant find her. So i finallt find her and shes behind a car across the street hitting her vape with 4 of the other girls that were there that i literally know. it felt so humiliating walking up to all of them laughing and having fun. I walked up and was like hey we are gonna head out bc he has to be up at 5 am and we have an hr drive back and they were like ah okay well thanks for coming! and i was like thanks for having us, and gave her a hug and gave amy a hug bc she was being pretty nice and amy suggested we should all hang out again and i was like yeah we need to! they mentioned that they were only hiding “to go vape” but im like… why does that mean i had to be excluded? Isnt that implying that you were also hiding from me? (i didnt say that)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the pictures she ended up posting were literally all of everyone else and her. I was in the backround of ONE. One of them that her mom took and even in the photo you can tell the dynamics of the table we were sitting at. It was us on one side and then his step family on the other. \n",
      "She later ended up posting abunch of snap stories of her getting drunk with the girls that were there and having a bunch of fun. Its ironic because when we were stopping and getting a card for them (they told us no gifts) my partner was like isnt $100 alot for just an engagement party? and i was like idk but jens a good friend so it doesnt matter. ironic. this all happened yesterday, i literally took off work and everything to be there and i didnt even get a thank you for the card or even a photo. Maybe im overthinking everything but god idk how much longer i can hold on to this friendship. Am i just an insecure person? \n",

We kept trying to include ourselves in the conversation but it would fall flat because no one would add on to it. At this point, his mom comes up (im friends with his mom on fb) bc shes friends with my parents and shes always been really nice to me but she literally just looked at me and says nothing and started talking to the step dad. I was like .. am i missing something? at this point we were like okay is jen going to come out and try and include us in anything like this feels weird and unwelcoming. She comes out and sits at the table right next to us with the other friends/girls that were my age. and she doesnt even attempt to invite me over. I was like ouch but its okay shes probably stressed because hosting a party is hard but then she starts taking pics with the other girls one at a time in front of the picture stand and didnt even ask me. She didnt talk to me ONCE during the party. All she said was hi and then guided us outside. this is someone i talk to everyday almost everyday and keep in mind we live an hour and a half away so i would have thought should have been happier to see us. Anyways, i text my partner and am like okay we have been here for 2 hrs and its not the vibe like this is weird and he agrees and so i get up to go inside and find jen and i walk in the kitchen and its some of the other couples that are my age and i literally know half of them and they all just go quiet. I break the silence by asking politely if jen was in here or if they have seen her and they all just say she is outside in the front and im like oh okay thank you and i walk outside and cant find her.

I walked up and was like hey we are gonna head out bc he has to be up at 5 am and we have an hr drive back and they were like ah okay well thanks for coming! and i was like thanks for having us, and gave her a hug and gave amy a hug bc she was being pretty nice and amy suggested we should all hang out again and i was like yeah we need to! they mentioned that they were only hiding “to go vape” but im like… why does that mean i had to be excluded?

Anyways we show up to jens party and her family is there, his is there, the friends from highschool are there. It was a bit weird but we werent thinking too much about it. Anyways, she says hi to us and doesnt introduce us to literally ANYONE and just guides us outside and we find a seat. Theres a couple of tables and a deck and we sit at an empty table and just chill for a bit because we dont know these people and jen hadnt come out to talk to us at all or anything so his step dad and sisters sit next to us and dont really acknowledge us (which is fine,just really awkward) but Z comes up and sits down to eat and literally does not acknowledge me or A (my fiance) at all. We kept trying to include ourselves in the conversation but it would fall flat because no one would add on to it. At this point, his mom comes up (im friends with his mom on fb) bc shes friends with my parents and shes always been really nice to me but she literally just looked at me and says nothing and started talking to the step dad. I was like .. am i missing something? at this point we were like okay is jen going to come out and try and include us in anything like this feels weird and unwelcoming. She comes out and sits at the table right next to us with the other friends/girls that were my age. and she doesnt even attempt to invite me over. I was like ouch but its okay shes probably stressed because hosting a party is hard but then she starts taking pics with the other girls one at a time in front of the picture stand and didnt even ask me. She didnt talk to me ONCE during the party. All she said was hi and then guided us outside. this is someone i talk to everyday almost everyday and keep in mind we live an hour and a half away so i would have thought should have been happier to see us. Anyways, i text my partner and am like okay we have been here for 2 hrs and its not the vibe like this is weird and he agrees and so i get up to go inside and find jen and i walk in the kitchen and its some of the other couples that are my age and i literally know half of them and they all just go quiet. I break the silence by asking politely if jen was in here or if they have seen her and they all just say she is outside in the front and im like oh okay thank you and i walk outside and cant find her. So i finallt find her and shes behind a car across the street hitting her vape with 4 of the other girls that were there that i literally know. it felt so humiliating walking up to all of them laughing and having fun. I walked up and was like hey we are gonna head out bc he has to be up at 5 am and we have an hr drive back and they were like ah okay well thanks for coming! and i was like thanks for having us, and gave her a hug and gave amy a hug bc she was being pretty nice and amy suggested we should all hang out again and i was like yeah we need to! they mentioned that they were only hiding “to go vape” but im like… why does that mean i had to be excluded? Isnt that implying that you were also hiding from me? (i didnt say that)\n",

      "All of the pictures she ended up posting were literally all of everyone else and her. I was in the backround of ONE. One of them that her mom took and even in the photo you can tell the dynamics of the table we were sitting at. It was us on one side and then his step family on the other. \n",
      "She later ended up posting abunch of snap stories of her getting drunk with the girls that were there and having a bunch of fun. Its ironic because when we were stopping and getting a card for them (they told us no gifts) my partner was like isnt $100 alot for just an engagement party? and i was like idk but jens a good friend so it doesnt matter. ironic. this all happened yesterday, i literally took off work and everything to be there and i didnt even get a thank you for the card or even a photo. Maybe im overthinking everything but god idk how much longer i can hold on to this friendship. Am i just an insecure person? \n",

      "F22. ive always had anxiety and depression growing up but my social anxiety had gotten way worse since of course covid and i have a foot surgery gone wrong so i was bed bound for the past year and i havent had to be in a social setting in a while. I only go to doctors appointments and my religious meetings. A couple months ago i went to costco with my mom and she wanted to sit and eat and i think this was my first panic attack. This was like 6 months of me being inside and idk i just stood there and started crying, my heart started beating fast, i was sweating profusely and was dizzy it felt like the walls were closing in… all bc it was a crowded cafeteria?? i havent done much research on it but my therapist diagnosed me with social anxiety so if any one can give me more insight on if u know what that feeling i felt was by just being in a social situation. Anyways tomorrow i am meeting up with a friend and he said pizza and beer and it was only supposed to be like 4 of us which i was alrdy nervous for but now its 30 ppl and im freaking out and just thinking about it has my heart beating fast. What can i do to be more calm?? i already take hydroxyine and was on zoloft any advice and information welcome!\n",

      "i have a really outgoing and extroverted personality, but i also have anxiety and i avoid my friends, start wondering about how to do things and freeze because i don't want to look stupid until someone tells me explicitly what to do even if it's obvious as shit, i cant make eye contact, i cant start a conversation, i cant do anything without people around me im comfortable with spoonfeeding instructions to me, sometimes i just lose the ability to hear or my vision goes blurry or i stop being able to recognize people, ect. anxiety runs in my family, i'm diagnosed. and i've talked about it with people, but they apparently think im lying for sympathy because i'm pretty talkative when i'm not so overwhelmed that my mind is blank. sometimes if im with friends, i can talk to strangers and be weird as shit without caring even afterwards as long my friends are doing the same thing. so i guess that gives their ideas validity but it doesnt matter if people think im weird when im fucking trolling. and even when i feel confident talking to them, i'll randomly stop talking in the middle of sentences/lose my train of thought because im overwhelmed. its like the anxiety lives on a second plane that keeps going even if i dont feel it. but yea. my friends think im lying and even when they DO see me get anxious they think im faking it, i told a friend who didnt even know the people who thought i was lying and he said he could see why. i think this might be why i've lost all of my friendships for being \"manipulative\". like maybe they think that if im lying about being anxious, im lying about everything. they probably think im also faking my cptsd and depression since i only have rare emotional flashbacks and i dont act like an emo stereotype :/\n",

Also I can be a people-pleaser so other would like me, but most of the time others think I am either boring, werid or just take advantage of it. I have resting bitch face but try to smile when talking to others. And last thing is that when I'm under pressure my thinking is very muddy and I can respond very impulsivly, so some people might even think that I'm kind of stupid.\n",

      "Recently I have been having really bad social anxiety around my close friends. For some background I am battling with pornography addiction and I have actually been sober for a good amount of time now (longest streak ever at around 2 months) and I feel like I am still suffering the side effects. No specific event has happened with me and my friends to cause this to happen. It is purely subconscious. I know they all want me around but I genuinely feel like I am about to have a panic attack whenever I am preparing to go out with them and I am anxiously waiting to leave. When I arrive, I am relieved slightly, but then I cant make conversation unless something specific is happening (watching tv, playing sports, etc.). Another preface is that I have had an abusive father and I very much fear being judged by people and other social fears, but I have NEVER in my life felt this type of anxiety around friends. I hate this feeling so much. It used to be the opposite where being around my friends made being in public bearable, but now I feel more comfortable talking to strangers than my friends. I feel like a fraud in my own mind. I constantly swallow my saliva around them, my lips get dry, My eyes water slightly, I hesitate and stutter when I speak as if am two seconds from getting shot. I cant stand this feeling. I don't understand what is causing it. I am assuming it is stopping porn, but I was beginning to feel so much better. I heard there are ups and downs to addiction recovery but after 2 months (I dont even feel like I will relapse anytime soon with little to no urges)???? I hate this, can anyone relate?\n",

      "Hi everyone! M25 here. I'll be traveling solo to Europe for two weeks in a couple months and I'm struggling to cope with social anxiety and decide what to do. I could start my trip by staying in a hostel and trying to leave my comfort zone immediately instead of procrastinating it to later in the trip...since all those anxieties are in my head and people are pretty cool & chill most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But also it might be pushing myself too hard trying to do everything at once. First solo travel, I'm going to a new continent and interacting with people I don't know (without privacy since is a hostel) all within one day without a break...it may be too much? In that case i could start the trip by taking an AirBNB and going to a hostel once I feel more comfortable in this new scenario i will put myself into. Money isn't an issue btw.\n",

      "In the last 4 years my social anxiety has become extreme, at least I think it’s social anxiety. When I’m out in public like a grocery store or shopping I get an overwhelming sense of discomfort. I get really hot and sweaty and sometimes my face will go bright red. This happens more often when talking to someone random or even someone I know. It could be the most normal conversation but then instantly my heart is racing and I start to have an internal panic attack. I used to avoid social interactions at all costs bc of this but I’m slowly trying to push myself back into socializing in hopes it will help my anxiety. This is becoming embarrassing and it’s making me feel more awkward. Has anyone ever dealt with this? Should I go to therapy or something. Thanks in advance for any responses. \n",

I only took one tablet, bottle says take 3 a day but wanted to see how I reacted first. Definitely took the edge off so I continued to take it. Didn’t get my period after until 35 days after I had my last “period” from the sugar pills. But, I’m not sure if it was the vitex or the pill that caused my period to come late (usually have a 22-24 day hell cycle).\\\\n\\\\nFast forward to now. It’s been 65 days since that last period, in that time I’ve taken vitex everyday, and for the majority of that, I upped the dose to two tablets daily. I’ve had weeks where I feel certain I’m gonna get my period and all the symptoms are exacerbated but it never comes, then I get a brief relief as if I got it but obviously I don’t get it. \\\\n\\\\nShould I stop taking the vitex? Should I have a break/ cut down? Could it be causing this? Or is it more likely the pill that I took 4 months ago? Surely not?\\\\n\\\\nHonestly I prefer this over getting my period every three weeks and having 3-5 days max where I can function in a month, but I don’t feel like this is normal and I’m worried that if I’m delaying my period in this way, when I do eventually get it it’s going to be so bad it’s the death of me (my pmdd is absolutely debilitating). I feel like the positive effects of the vitex are flatlining and I’m in a limbo phase now just waiting for hell to come forth but it just doesn’t…\\\\n\\\\nAny advice please?
